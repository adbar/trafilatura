## Introduction

Trafilatura is a cutting-edge **Python package and command-line tool**
designed to **gather text on the Web and simplify the process of turning
raw HTML into structured, meaningful data**. It includes all necessary
discovery and text processing components to perform **web crawling,
downloads, scraping, and extraction** of main texts, metadata and
comments. It aims at staying **handy and modular**: no database is
required, the output can be converted to commonly used formats.

Going from HTML bulk to essential parts can alleviate many problems
related to text quality, by **focusing on the actual content**,
**avoiding the noise** caused by recurring elements like headers and footers
and by **making sense of the data and metadata** with selected information.
The extractor strikes a balance between limiting noise (precision) and
including all valid parts (recall). It is **robust and reasonably fast**.

Trafilatura is [widely used](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/used-by.html)
and integrated into [thousands of projects](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/network/dependents)
by companies like HuggingFace, IBM, and Microsoft Research as well as institutions like
the Allen Institute, Stanford, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and
the University of Munich.


### Features

- Advanced web crawling and text discovery:
   - Support for sitemaps (TXT, XML) and feeds (ATOM, JSON, RSS)
   - Smart crawling and URL management (filtering and deduplication)

- Parallel processing of online and offline input:
   - Live URLs, efficient and polite processing of download queues
   - Previously downloaded HTML files and parsed HTML trees

- Robust and configurable extraction of key elements:
   - Main text (common patterns and generic algorithms like jusText and readability)
   - Metadata (title, author, date, site name, categories and tags)
   - Formatting and structure: paragraphs, titles, lists, quotes, code, line breaks, in-line text formatting
   - Optional elements: comments, links, images, tables

- Multiple output formats:
   - TXT and Markdown
   - CSV
   - JSON
   - HTML, XML and [XML-TEI](https://tei-c.org/)

- Optional add-ons:
   - Language detection on extracted content
   - Speed optimizations

- Actively maintained with support from the open-source community:
   - Regular updates, feature additions, and optimizations
   - Comprehensive documentation


### Evaluation and alternatives

Trafilatura consistently outperforms other open-source libraries in text
extraction benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy in
extracting web content. The extractor tries to strike a balance between
limiting noise and including all valid parts.

For more information see the [benchmark section](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io/en/latest/evaluation.html)
and the [evaluation readme](https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/blob/master/tests/README.rst)
to run the evaluation with the latest data and packages.

## Context

This work started as a PhD project at the crossroads of linguistics and
NLP, this expertise has been instrumental in shaping Trafilatura over
the years. Initially launched to create text databases for research purposes
at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (DWDS and ZDL units),
this package continues to be maintained but its future depends on community support.

**If you value this software or depend on it for your product, consider
sponsoring it and contributing to its codebase**. Your support
[on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/adbar) or [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/adbarbaresi)
will help maintain and enhance this popular package.

*Trafilatura* is an Italian word for [wire
drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_drawing) symbolizing the
refinement and conversion process. It is also the way shapes of pasta
are formed.
