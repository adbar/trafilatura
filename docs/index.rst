Description
-----------

Trafilatura is a **Python package and command-line tool** designed to gather text on the Web. It includes discovery, extraction and text processing components. Its main applications are **web crawling, downloads, scraping, and extraction** of main texts, metadata and comments. It aims at staying **handy and modular**: no database is required, the output can be converted to commonly used formats.

Going from raw HTML to essential parts can alleviate many problems related to text quality, by avoiding the **noise caused by recurring elements** like headers and footers and by **making sense of the data and metadata** with selected information. The extractor strikes a balance between limiting noise (precision) and including all valid parts (recall). It is **robust and reasonably fast**.

Trafilatura is `widely used <used-by.html>`_ and integrated into `thousands of projects <https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/network/dependents>`_ by companies like HuggingFace, IBM, and Microsoft Research as well as institutions like the Allen Institute, Stanford, the Tokyo Institute of Technology, and the University of Munich.


Features
~~~~~~~~

- Advanced web crawling and text discovery:
   - Support for sitemaps (TXT, XML) and feeds (ATOM, JSON, RSS)
   - Smart crawling and URL management (filtering and deduplication)
- Parallel processing of online and offline input:
   - Live URLs, efficient and polite processing of download queues
   - Previously downloaded HTML files and parsed HTML trees
- Robust and configurable extraction of key elements:
   - Main text (common patterns and generic algorithms like jusText and readability)
   - Metadata (title, author, date, site name, categories and tags)
   - Formatting and structure: paragraphs, titles, lists, quotes, code, line breaks, in-line text formatting
   - Optional elements: comments, links, images, tables
- Multiple output formats:
   - TXT and Markdown
   - CSV
   - JSON
   - HTML, XML and `XML-TEI <https://tei-c.org/>`_
- Optional add-ons:
   - Language detection on extracted content
   - Speed optimizations
- Actively maintained with support from the open-source community:
   - Regular updates, feature additions, and optimizations
   - Comprehensive documentation


Evaluation and alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trafilatura consistently outperforms other open-source libraries in text extraction benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and accuracy in extracting web content. The extractor tries to strike a balance between limiting noise and including all valid parts.

The `benchmark section <evaluation.html>`_ details alternatives and results, the `evaluation readme <https://github.com/adbar/trafilatura/blob/master/tests/README.rst>`_ describes how to reproduce the evaluation.


In a nutshell
-------------

Primary installation method is with a Python package manager: ``pip install trafilatura`` (â†’ `installation documentation <installation.html>`_).

With Python:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import trafilatura
    >>> downloaded = trafilatura.fetch_url('https://github.blog/2019-03-29-leader-spotlight-erin-spiceland/')
    >>> trafilatura.extract(downloaded)
    # outputs main content and comments as plain text ...

On the command-line:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ trafilatura -u "https://github.blog/2019-03-29-leader-spotlight-erin-spiceland/"
    # outputs main content and comments as plain text ...

Context
-------

This work started as a PhD project at the crossroads of linguistics and NLP,
this expertise has been instrumental in shaping Trafilatura over the years. 
Initially launched to create text databases for research purposes
at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (DWDS and ZDL units),
this package continues to be maintained but its future depends on community support.
