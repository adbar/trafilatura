<h>Ethical Decisions - Morton Thiokol and the Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster

<h>Pre-Disaster Background

   <p>The significance of starting with January, 1985, results from my
   observations made during the post flight inspection of hardware from
   Flight 51C which was launched on January 14, 1985. I found that hot
   combustion gases had blown by the primary seals on two field joints
   and had produced large arc lengths of blackened grease between the
   primary and secondary seals. Subsequent to reporting my findings, I
   was ordered to MSFC to present a preliminary report prior to formal
   FRR meetings.

   <p>I participated in the formal FRR's for flight 51E which was scheduled
   for an April launch. The presentations were given at MSFC in February
   at three successively higher level review boards with exclusions and
   refinements in content made at each board level. I spoke about my
   belief that the low ambient temperature prior to launch was
   responsible for such a large witness of hot gas (approximately 5500 °F
   [3040 °C]) blow-by but NASA Program Management insisted on that
   position being softened for higher and final review board
   presentations. The ambient temperature was 18 to 22 °F (-8 to -6 °C)
   several days prior to launch and in the 60 - 65 °F (16 to 18 °C) range
   at launch time and resulted in a seal temperature of 53 °F ( 12 °C)
   -which was calculated after the damage was found.

   <p>Accordingly, the final FRR assessment chart read as follows:

   <h>Evaluation Summary
          <p>STS-51C primary 0-ring erosion on two field joints
          STS-51C soot between primary and secondary 0-rings on both
          field joints predicted after STS-11 observation, first time
          observed
          Evidence of heat affect on secondary O-ring of A68 (right hand)
          center field joint but no erosion --first time heat affect on
          secondary O-ring has been observed

   <h>Conclusion
          <p>STS-51C consistent with erosion data base
          Low temperature enhanced probability of blowby -- STS-51C
          experienced worst case temperature change in Florida history
          STS-51E could exhibit some behavior
          Condition is acceptable
          STS-51E field joints are acceptable for flight

   <p>These conclusions were accepted and the boosters were certified for
   launch.

   <p>I returned to MTI in Utah and met with Arnie Thompson, who was the
   Supervisor of Structural Design and Analysis for the SRM case
   segments, to discuss the hot gas blow-by scenario and the affects of
   cold temperature on O-ring resiliency, which we defined as the ability
   of the seal to restore itself to a round cross sectional shape after
   the squeeze on the seal is removed. The preliminary resiliency
   testing, which was requested by Arnie Thompson, was performed in March
   and showed that a low temperature of 50 °F (10 °C) was a problem, as
   the seal material could not follow the rate of gap opening and lost
   contact with its mating surface. The significance of this data was
   that the seal erosion and blow-by problem was known to occur within
   0.60 seconds during the motor ignition transient. The data was
   discussed with MTI Engineering Management, but was thought to be too
   sensitive by them to release to anyone.

   <p>Another post flight inspection was performed in June, 1985, at MTI
   facilities in Utah on a nozzle joint from Flight 51B (SRM 16A) which
   was launched on April 29, 1985. The nozzle joint configuration is
   shown in Figure 2 with all dimensions in inches. The bore (radial)
   seal is the primary seal and the face seal is the secondary seal in
   this joint.

   <p>This joint was found to have the primary seal eroded through in three
   places as shown in Figure 3.

<h>Figure 3. SRM-16A Nozzel Joint Primary O-Ring

   <p>The darkened areas represent the remaining seal material after the hot
   gas blow-by occurred. The secondary seal in the same joint was eroded
   to a depth of 0.032 inches (0.81 mm) but sealed as expected. It was
   postulated from the evidence that the primary seal had not sealed
   during the full two minutes of booster flight.

   <p>My former concerns about seal erosion and blow-by now escalated
   because if the same scenario should occur in a field joint, the
   secondary seal could also be compromised because it was a bore seal
   instead of the very safe face seal in the nozzle joint. This
   heightened concern was especially true for a low temperature launch
   because of the preliminary test results on seal resiliency at 50 °F
   (10 °C).

   <p>An FRR was held at MSFC on July 1, 1985 for flight 51F which was
   scheduled for launch on July 29, 1985, with an additional presentation
   given on July 2nd which covered the overall problem status with all
   the booster seals. The preliminary test results on O-ring resiliency
   that were obtained in March and kept secret were presented to NASA for
   the first time at this meeting.

   <p>The preliminary test configuration placed an O-ring seal into a flight
   size groove in a flat plate and compressed the seal 0.040 inches (1.02
   mm) with another flat plate. After temperature conditioning of the
   assembly, the plates were separated 0.030 inches (0.76 mm) at a 2.0
   inch (5.08 cm) per minute rate to simulate a flight rate of
   approximately 3.2 inches (8.13 cm) per minute (slightly
   unconservative).

   <p>The test results showed no loss of seal contact at 100 °F (38 °C);
   loss of seal contact for 2.4 seconds at 75 °F (24 °C) and loss of seal
   contact for in excess of 10 minutes at 50 °F (10 °C). The testing also
   showed that a larger diameter seal (0.295 in - 7.49 mm) lost contact
   for 2 to 3 seconds at 50 °F (10 °C). This showed that the larger
   diameter seal performed at 50 °F (10 °C) similar to the operational
   flight seal (0.280 in - 7.11 mm) at 75 °F (24 °C), which was why the
   larger seal was being considered for a short-term fix.

   <p>Everyone on the program, working with the joint seal problems, was now
   aware of the influence of low temperature on the field joint seals.

   <p>Again, my concern about the joints increased due to the lack of
   attention being given to this problem by MTI. My notebook entry on
   August 15,1985 reads as follows: "An attempt to form the team (I was
   referring to the SIRM Seal Erosion Task Team) was made on 19 July
   1985. This attempt virtually failed and resulted in my writing memo
   2870:FY86:073. This memo finally got some response and a team was
   formed officially. The first meeting was held on August 15, 1985 at
   2:30 p.m." The memo I referred to is the one I wrote to the Vice
   President of Engineering at MTI on July 31, 1985. The memo was stamped
   COMPANY PRIVATE by my boss and had a very limited distribution until I
   read it to the Presidential Commission on February 25, 1986. The memo
   reads as follows:

   <p>"Subject: SRM O-Ring Erosion/Potential Failure Criticality. This
   letter is written to insure that management is fully aware of the
   seriousness of the current O-ring erosion problem in the SRM joints
   from an engineering standpoint. The mistakenly accepted position on
   the joint problem was to fly without fear of failure and to run a
   series of design evaluations which would ultimately lead to a solution
   or at least a significant reduction of the erosion problem. This
   position is now drastically changed as a result of the SRM 16A nozzle
   joint erosion which eroded a secondary O-ring with the primary O-ring
   never sealing."

   <p>"If the same scenario should occur in a field joint (and it could),
   then it is a jump ball as to the success or failure of the joint
   because the secondary O-ring cannot respond to the clevis opening rate
   and may not be capable of pressurization. The result would be a
   catastrophe of the highest order--loss of human life."

   <p>"An unofficial team (a memo defining the team and its purpose was
   never published) with leader was formed on 19 July 1985 and was tasked
   with solving the problem for both the short and long term. This
   unofficial team is essentially nonexistent at this time. In my
   opinion, the team must be officially given the responsibility and the
   authority to execute the work that needs to be done on a
   noninterference basis (full-time assignment until completed)."

   <p>"It is my honest and very real fear that if we do not take immediate
   action to dedicate a team to solve the problem, with the field joint
   having the number one priority, then we stand in jeopardy of losing a
   flight along with all the launch pad facilities."

   <p>The memo was signed by R. M. Boisjoly and concurred to by J. R. Kopp,
   Manager, Applied Mechanics, who was my boss.

   <p>During the July-August time period, NASA headquarters in Washington,
   D. C. asked MTI to prepare and present a summary of problems with all
   the booster seals on August 19, 1985. This was done and that is why I
   find it so incredible that top NASA management denies knowing anything
   about the problems with the joint seals, when questioned by the
   Presidential Commission.

   <p>MTI was then asked by NASA MSFC in September to send a representative
   to the SAE Conference in October to discuss the joint seal designs and
   solicit help from the technical experts in attendance. However, I was
   given strict instructions, which come from MSFC, not to express the
   critical urgency of fixing the joints but to only emphasize the joint
   improvement aspect during my presentation. I prepared and presented
   seven Viewgraphs to approximately 130 technical experts at the
   conference.

   <p>I then asked for help in the form of design improvement suggestions
   and stated that we were not asking for free advice but were willing to
   contract for work, but no one said a word. So Bob Ebeling and I spent
   the remainder of the convention time meeting with seal vendors whom we
   had previously contacted for help. In retrospect, I'm not surprised
   that no one responded to my pleas for help when I showed them the
   parameters of the joints. What they saw and heard were joint gap
   configurations (both static and dynamic) that were approximately an
   order of magnitude worse than anything they had previously
   encountered. I don't blame them for avoiding any comments and
   suggestions when asked.

   <p>The seal erosion task team was frustrated right from the start due to
   lack of management support to provide manpower and material resources
   necessary for us to accomplish the task of fixing the joints.
   Accordingly, I wrote a series of very damning activity reports in
   which I left no room for error about my feelings due to the lack of
   management support. The last such report written was on October 4,
   1985 and reads as follows:

   <p>"SRM Seal Problem Task Team Status. The team generally has been
   experiencing trouble from the business-as-usual attitude from
   supporting organizations. Part of this is due to lack of understanding
   of how important this task team activity is and the rest is due to
   pure operating procedure inertia which prevents timely results to a
   specific request.

   <p>The team met with Joe Kilminster on October 3, 1985 to discuss this
   problem. He wanted specific examples which he was given and he simply
   concluded that it was every team member's responsibility to flog
   problems that occurred to organizational supervision and work to
   remove the road block by getting the required support to solve the
   problem. The problem was further explained to require almost full-time
   nursing of each task to insure it is taken to completion by a support
   group. Joe simply agreed and said we should then nurse every task we
   have.

   <p>He plain doesn't understand that there are not enough people to do
   that kind of nursing of each task, but he doesn't seem to mind
   directing that the task nevertheless gets done. For example, the team
   just found out that when we submit a request to purchase an item, that
   it goes through approximately six to eight people before a purchase
   order is written and the item actually ordered.

   <p>The vendors we are working with on seals and spacer rings have
   responded to our requests in a timely manner, yet, we (MTI) cannot get
   a purchase order to them in a timely manner. Our lab has been waiting
   for a function generator since September 15, 1985. The paperwork
   authorizing the purchase was finished by Engineering on September 24,
   1985 and placed into the system. We have yet to receive the requested
   item. This type of example is typical and results in lost resources
   that had been planned to do test work for us in a timely manner.

   <p>I for one resent working at full capacity all week long and then being
   required to support activity on the weekend that could have been
   accomplished during the week. I might add that even NASA perceives
   that the team is being blocked in its engineering efforts to
   accomplish its task. NASA is sending an engineering representative to
   stay with us starting October 14th. We feel that this is the direct
   result of their feelings that we (MTI) are not responding quickly
   enough on the seal problem. I should add that several of the team
   members requested that we be given a specific manufacturing engineer,
   quality engineer, safety engineer and four to six technicians to allow
   us to do our tests on a noninterference basis with the rest of the
   system. This request was deemed not necessary when Joe decided that
   the nursing of the task approach was directed.

   <p>Finally, the basic problem boils down to the fact that all MTI
   problems have #1 priority and that upper management apparently feels
   that the SRM program is ours for sure and the customer be damned."

   <p>The Activity Report was signed by Roger M. Boisjoly on October 4, 1985
   and given to my boss's secretary. Unfortunately, I never received any
   comments back and I never knew if the contents of my activity reports
   were incorporated into the reports up through the management
   organization to the top.
