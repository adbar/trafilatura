                    <h>LITLE JOHNNY CAME IN FROM THE COLD 
     _________________________________________________________________


   <p>Howdy! ,
   <p>I'm Lame Little Johnny, a ten week old precious male kitten, who
   desperately needs a helping paw! When I was younger, my front left leg
   was badly injured. I was shunned by my mom and siblings and was left
   to fend for myself. I dragged myself around for several weeks,
   starving, weak, and full of fleas and worms! Finally, a nice gentleman
   found me and called Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital, who told him
   to call Shirl of Stubbs Animal Rescue, also a client of Del Val. I was
   examined by Dr. John Vinciguerra. He told my rescue mom that my leg
   had to be amputated! However, before I can be operated on, I must put
   on some weight and get stronger. Dr. Steve Milden and Dr. John
   Vinciguerra of Delaware Valley Veterinary Hospital will be doing my
   surgery. My rescue mom says they are the BEST and that they will take
   great care of me!
   <p>After I heal, I will need a very special loving home.
   <p>Thank you and please say a prayer for me.
   <p>Love,
   <p>Little Johnny
   <p>PS
   <p>UPDATE!!!!!!! LITTLE JOHNNY IS RECOVERING NICELY FROM HIS SURGERY. HE
   IS RUNNING AND PLAYING ON HIS THREE GOOD LEGS. LITTLE JOHNNY SENDS HIS
   LOVE TO ALL THE CARING PEOPLE WHO HELPED HIM THROUGH HIS ORDEAL.
   <p>UPDATE!!!!!!! LITTLE JOHNNY HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY HIS FOSTER PARENTS WHO
   COULD NOT BEAR TO PART WITH HIM. HE IS NOW ENJOYING LIFE IN HIS
   PERMANENT FOREVER HOME. MANY THANKS TO THIS WONDERFUL MOTHER AND
   DAUGHTER DUO FOR ALL THEY HAVE DONE ON BEHALF OF HOMELESS ANIMALS.

                         <h>See Our Adoptable Pet List

   <p>"I ask for the privilege of not being born ... not to be born until
   you can assure me of a home and a master to protect me, and a right to
   live as long as I am physically able to enjoy life ... not to be born
   until my body is precious and men have ceased to exploit it because it
   is cheap and plentiful." Need we say more? Pet overpopulation is a
   monumental problem. Spay/Neuter is the solution.

       the necessary recovery period, the pets are returned to their
       grateful owners in Camden.

       facilities. As a result, there will be no more births and no more
       destruction of unwanted, surplus cats at these locations. It was
       very heartwarming to see the love and devotion shown by employees
       and temporary residents of these two facilities.
       <p>Many litters of kittens were pulled, vetted, socialized, fostered,
       and will be placed for adoption when ready.

       May, Animal Welfare Assoc, representatives from the two government

       FACILITY. Just in time for all the kittens needing rescue, PACS
       teams with Partner in Prevention Not Destruction, Stubbs Animal
       Rescue, to build a sheltering facility. Additional space was
       needed so more furry angels could be rescued.

       County. Almost 700 certificates for free spay/neuter surgeries and
       vaccinations were distributed in the first four months of
       operation. Certificates are currently redeemable at ten private
       veterinary offices and two spay/neuter clinics.
       <p>On behalf of our feline friends, we sincerely thank the veterinary
       community and local volunteers in Cape May County for joining PACS
       and CMCASA in this important endeavor. We especially thank Madelyn
       Filipski of Cape May County Animal Shelter Alliance who worked
       from morning to night to make this program a great success.
       <h>DECEMBER 10, 2005: 
	   <p>PACS RECEIVES A WARM THANK YOU.
       <p>I wanted to thank you for helping us last week in a mass trapping
       event that was magnificent. It involved a colony located right in
       the midst of the Wharton State Forest, managed by a fellow living
       in one of those grandfathered houses and surrounded by state
       forest. This was as colony that was cause for consternation...
       Thanks for your help in this most remarkable day..... Thanks again
       for your very great help in this very good story with a most happy
       ending.
       <p>Preparation for the next project to spay/neuter 90+ cats is
       underway. Will keep you posted.
