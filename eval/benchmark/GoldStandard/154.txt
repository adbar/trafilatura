<h>Sandy Berger's Socks

   <p>...have been cleared of wrongdoing.

     <p>The National Archives and the Justice Department have concluded
     nothing is missing and nothing in the Clinton administration's
     record was withheld from the 9-11 Commission.
     <p>The Wall Street Journal reports archives staff have accounted for
     all classified documents Berger looked at.

   <p>Tapped has more, from the subscription-only Wall Street Journal story:

     <p>Officials looking into the removal of classified documents from the
     National Archives by former Clinton National Security Adviser
     Samuel Berger say no original materials are missing and nothing Mr.
     Berger reviewed was withheld from the commission investigating the
     Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.
     <p>Several prominent Republicans, including House Speaker Dennis
     Hastert and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, have voiced suspicion
     that when Mr. Berger was preparing materials for the 9/11
     Commission on the Clinton administration's antiterror actions, he
     may have removed documents that were potentially damaging to the
     former president's record.
     <p>The conclusion by archives officials and others would seem to lay
     to rest the issue of whether any information was permanently
     destroyed or withheld from the commission.
     <p>Archives spokeswoman Susan Cooper said officials there "are
     confident that there aren't any original documents missing in
     relation to this case." She said in most cases, Mr. Berger was
     given photocopies to review, and that in any event officials have
     accounted for all originals to which he had access.

   <p>This is going to get just as much play on the cable news networks and
   in the right-wing blogosphere as the original accusations, right?
   <p>Right?

<h>Book Review: Beyond Fear

   <p>Now that I've lured you all here with my sensitive handling of
   emotional nuance, let's switch gears and geek out for a while. I want
   to talk about Bruce Schneier's new book Beyond Fear. Bruce was nice
   enough to send me a copy back in May, when I wrote about systematic
   errors in risk perception. I read it in one big gulp, and ever since
   then I've been carrying it around in my briefcase, waiting to have
   enough time to write a review. Here it is.
   <p>Bruce Schneier is a security expert who achieved his fame in the field
   of cryptography and Internet security and has subsequently branched
   out to write and consult about general security issues. Beyond Fear is
   his attempt to demystify security for the post-9/11 general public.
   His general thesis is that all security decisions, ranging from a
   homeowner's decision about whether to buy a burglar alarm to a
   government's decision about whether to spy on its own citizens, are
   based on the same general concepts. By understanding these concepts,
   we can make rational decisions about whether and how proposed security
   measures should be implemented, rather than being driven by fear.
   <p>Schneier proposes a five-step process for evaluating any security
   measure: (1) What assets need to be protected? (2) What are the risks
   to these assets? (3) How well does the security solution mitigate
   those risks? (4) What other risks does the security solution cause?
   (5) What costs and tradeoffs does the security solution impose?
   Schneier models the five-step process in sidebars throughout the book,
   applying it to security decisions as diverse as "should I use my
   credit card to make purchases over the Internet?" and "should I invade
   Iraq to protect my country from terrorism?"
   <p>The five steps seem simple, even obvious, but consider how often
   they're overlooked in public debate. For example, since 9/11 we have
   frequently been told by pundits that "giving up a few rights is a
   small price to pay for safety," and have been encouraged to skim over
   inconvenient questions about how much safety we're actually getting
   for the price.
   <p>I found two of Schneier's concepts particularly useful. First is the
   notion that everyone involved in a security decision has their own
   agenda, and that, as illustrated here, these agendas are often driven
   by factors unrelated to security â such as profit or PR or the need
   for people to feel safe. Non-security agendas aren't necessarily bad
   things. For example, Schneier points out that during the 2002 sniper
   attacks on the Washington DC area, many parents drove their children
   to school despite the fact that, statistically, the children were at
   greater risk of dying in a car accident than a sniper attack. Driving
   them to school was valuable because it provided emotional security,
   not because it increased their physical security. Schneier's point is
   not that non-security agendas must be eliminated, but that they must
   be understood - and not mistaken for real security factors.
   <p>The other concept I found especially useful is that every security
   decision involves tradeoffs. We can't decide to have "no compromises"
   when it comes to security, we can only decide where our compromises
   will be, who will bear the brunt of them, and how we will deal with
   them. Explicit discussion of security tradeoffs is often avoided, as
   anyone who's read the "child safety" sections of parenting magazines
   can attest. That makes it awfully difficult to reject proposed
   security measures. ("Well, why wouldn't we want to do it, if it saves
   just one life... if there's the smallest chance...") We can't make
   rational decisions about security without articulating and choosing
   among the associated tradeoffs.
   <p>The first part of Beyond Fear outlines the basic principles of
   Schneier's approach to security decision-making. The second part of
   the book discusses specific elements of threats, attackers, defenses,
   and countermeasures (for example: "Brittleness makes for bad
   security," "Detection works where prevention fails"), in short
   chapters filled with vivid real-world examples. Schneier's got a gift
   for logical exposition; reading this book, I frequently found myself
   saying "how obvious!" in response to a point I knew had never occurred
   to me before. At the end of the book, I felt much more confident in my
   ability to understand security debates and participate intelligently
   in the discussion.
   <p>Beyond Fear is beautifully organized, clearly expressed, and not the
   least bit dull. Rivka-Bob says: Check it out.

<h>Ambivalence

   <p>Imagine that it's 1973. The Supreme Court has just struck down
   abortion laws. You're pregnant with your fourth wanted child, when
   suddenly the Prenatal Diagnosis Fairy appears to you in your
   obstetrician's office.

     <p>"I've got bad news," she says. "Your baby is not developing
     properly in the womb. One of her hip sockets is just plain missing,
     and one of her arms is irreparably small and deformed. She'll spend
     a year of her babyhood encased in heavy plaster, unable to move
     anything below her armpits. She'll have surgery 11 times in her
     first 23 years of life, several of which will ultimately prove to
     be failures. She'll have a chronic pain condition by the age of 12.
     She'll never have the physical ability to do certain simple things
     like braiding her own hair or riding a bike. By her early twenties,
     she won't even be able to walk one city block unassisted.
     <p>"You'll shepherd your infant through not one, not two, but three
     different surgeries before she's even old enough to understand why
     she's being hurt. You'll leave your other kids with a babysitter
     again and again so you can sleep on a chair in her hospital room.
     You'll try to figure out what to say when she comes home from
     junior high school crying because her classmates make fun of the
     way she walks. So I just want to know: do you think you're up for
     it? And even if you are, do you think it would be fair to her?"

   <p>Like most disabled adults, I'm ambivalent about the abortion of
   disabled children. It's frequently brought out as a pro-choice trump
   card: "Well, what about children who would be born deformed and suffer
   terrible pain?" Some people have made the paradoxical argument that
   disabled children have a "right not to be born." There are, in fact,
   "wrongful birth" lawsuits. Yes, those are all about children who are
   much more disabled than me - but I've had friends over the years with
   osteogenesis imperfecta, with cerebral palsy, with spina bifida, with
   no arms and legs. Where on the continuum do you draw the line? The
   answers aren't easy, as this painful article makes clear. It also
   makes it clear that there are people who choose abortion because of
   disabilities that are much less severe than mine.
   <p>I used to say, "I don't have a problem with abortion on the basis of
   'I don't want to have a child right now,' I have a problem with
   abortion on the basis of 'I don't want to have THIS child.' " But I
   can't sustain that kind of moral smugness in the face of stories like
   this one - I can only admire the courage it takes to make such an
   impossibly hard decision. I would probably do the same thing, and to
   hell with my disability-rights politics.
   <p>"I could never have your strength," people say to parents of disabled
   children - as if these parents have some sort of special quality that
   makes their situation easier than it would be for other people. I know
   differently. Some parents of disabled children - mine, incidentally,
   among them - rise to the occasion and do a fantastic job. Others
   don't. My dissertation added to the research literature demonstrating
   that congenitally disabled children are at greater risk of parental
   abuse. So I'm under no illusions about the stress, pain, uncertainty,
   and financial and physical burdens that come with parenting disabled
   children. And yet I also know that disabled people can make valuable
   contributions to both family life and society at large. I know that
   life as a disabled person - even a severely disabled person - can be
   well worth living.
   <p>Where does that leave me? With Barbara Ehrenreich. Her op-ed in
   yesterday's New York Times takes on "the prejudice [...] that a
   termination for medical reasons is somehow on a higher moral plane
   than a run-of-the-mill abortion." Ehrenreich supports the right to
   "run-of-the-mill abortion," of course, and so do I. Absolutely. But I
   also refuse to concede that women who abort a disabled fetus have made
   a choice that's better or more understandable or more deservedly legal
   than women who have aborted a fetus because they fear they'll never
   finish college with a baby, or because they've always disliked
   children. It always comes down to a personal choice, a personal
   weighing of uncertain costs and benefits. I may not always be morally
   comfortable with the resulting decisions - but, then again, no one has
   asked me to be. I don't have to approve of every single abortion to
   remain determinedly pro-choice.
   <p>This next paragraph is pretty much beside the point, but I don't want
   to leave the first part of my post unbalanced. So: in my imaginary
   scenario, here's what the Prenatal Diagnosis Fairy didn't say.

     <p>"Your baby will grow up smart and determined. She'll earn a Ph.D.
     in clinical psychology, make some original contributions to the
     research literature, and help people work through the most painful
     aspects of their lives. She'll be a good cook. She'll use that
     deformed arm to play the piano passably well and to complete
     elaborate needlework projects. She'll have great friends and some
     successful romantic relationships and a happy marriage. Her
     disability will cause intense physical and mental pain over the
     years, and sometimes it will be bitter and awful. But it will also
     make her stronger and tougher. By the age of 30, she'll have
     recovered enough mobility to be able to hike three miles over rough
     terrain, and to her that will feel like a marathon-quality
     accomplishment. Over the years she'll be active in political
     campaigns, volunteer organizations, and her church. People will
     listen when she speaks. And eventually, she'll create a modestly
     successful weblog that will forever associate her in people's minds
     with small, furry, aquatic mammals. So when you make your decision,
     keep those parts in mind, too."

<h>Secondary Questioning

   <p>Kathy Gill, at about.com, has attempted to verify the claim that it's
   Department of Transportation policy "to fine airlines if they have
   more than two young Arab males in secondary questioning because that's
   discriminatory" - as asserted here, for example, by Michael
   Smerconish. The source of the claim is a statement by 9/11
   Commissioner John Lehman, who told Smerconish:

     <p>"We had testimony a couple of months ago from the past president of
     United, and current president of American Airlines that kind of
     shocked us all. They said under oath that indeed the Department of
     Transportation continued to fine any airline that was caught having
     more than two people of the same ethnic persuasion in a secondary
     line for line for questioning, including and especially, two
     Arabs," he said.

   <p>Something about this apparently didn't sound right to Kathy Gill, who
   went back to examine the testimony of United and American executives
   before the 9/11 commission.

     <p>I've read the transcript of the testimony at hearing seven of the
     9-11 Commission, where United and American executives testified.
     Lehman's allegation is not reflected in this testimony. Relevant
     parts follow:

     <p>Mr Kerrey (Commissioner):
     I must tell you that the law (U.S. Code Title 49, Section 44902)
     doesn't mention the FAA. The law says, quote, "An air carrier may
     refuse to transport a passenger or property the carrier decides is
     or might be inimical to safety."
     <p>Mr. Soliday (United, emphasis added [by Kathy Gill]):
     "But if I could share some history with you, how that law has been
     applied to us is that when we have tried to deny boarding --most
     recently after 9/11, 38 of our captains denied boarding to people
     they thought were a threat. Those people filed complaints with the
     DOT, we were sued, and we were asked not to do it again."
     <p>Mr. Arpey (American, in response to question from Commissioner
     Lehman):
     "In a post-9/11 environment, we had situations where our crew
     members were uncomfortable with passengers on board the airplane,
     they hauled them off the airplane and I think -- there was 10 or 11
     of them -- and today we're being sued by the DOT over each one of
     those cases."

   <p>So what was actually reported during that testimony before the
   Commission is that airlines have been sued because pilots refused to
   transport certain passengers. (Remember the Arab-American Secret
   Service agent who wasn't permitted to fly even after law enforcement
   vouched for his identity? Do you suppose there was a lawsuit on his
   behalf?) The testimony had nothing whatsoever to do with racial quotas
   for secondary questioning.
   <p>Smerconish admits that, after the first time he wrote about the
   alleged policy, the Department of Transportation told him that the
   policy does not exist. (Apparently he never contacted them himself to
   ask.)

     <p>"...A member of the 9/11 Commission was incorrect in telling...
     that the Federal Aviation Administration used a quota restricting
     the number of foreign passengers that could be subjected to
     secondary screening at one time. Despite the testimony... cited in
     your column, secondary screening of passengers is random or
     behavior-based. It is not now, nor has ever been based on
     ethnicity, religion or appearance."

   <p>"Is that supposed to make us feel better?" Smerconish asks
   rhetorically. Yes, in fact, it is. Smerconish (and others propagating
   this story, like Michelle Malkin and Annie Jacobsen) talks about the
   alleged policy as if it prohibits the investigation of suspicious
   behavior. It should be reassuring to know that security screeners can
   question and search all the suspiciously-behaving Arabs they want,
   without fear of punishment. But apparently, Smerconish will only be
   satisfied if random screenings are completely replaced by Arab-only
   screenings.

<h>Supply And Demand

   <p>I'm still catching up on blog reading, so I almost missed Kevin Drum's
   hilarious economics contest:

     <p>Supply and demand. Yes indeed. The labor market is a slave to
     supply and demand just like any other market, right?
     <p>Odd, then, that CEO pay rose 27% in 2003, isn't it? Did the supply
     of CEOs shrink last year? Did demand skyrocket?
     <p>What's more, compared to average workers, who remain stuck in the
     invisible grip of Adam Smith, CEO pay has increased about 3x since
     1990 and about 7x since 1980.
     <p>Is this the free market at work? That's what I'm told. So I have a
     contest in mind: a prize for the least laughable explanation for
     why CEO pay has gone up 7x since 1980 based on supply and demand.
     At a minimum, winning entries should explain the following:
     <p>Why the supply of CEOs has decreased.
     <p>Why the demand for CEOs has increased.
     <p>Why the elasticity of the CEO demand curve is apparently steeper
     than for any other commodity on the planet.

   <p>Okay, so plenty of the entries are unimaginative. (Supply has
   decreased because so many CEOs are in prison, heh heh heh. Repeated ad
   nauseam by dozens of other people who don't read comments before
   posting.) But there are also some true gems. Here are my favorites so
   far:

     <l>1. The onslaught of government regulation such as Sarbanne-Oxley
     has 1) dramatically increased the workload of the CEOs and 2) is
     discouraging aspiring CEOs from entering the field just like
     malpractice insurance has dramatically diminished the number of
     qualified physicians...
     <l>2. With so many new businesses being generated, demand for CEO's is
     higher than ever before, but supply is low because few wish to
     labor under the extreme tax burden imposed on our nation's CEOs.
     <l>3. The post-Enron world has made being a CEO a very risky venture,
     which assuredly adds a supply curve explanation. [The other two are
     clearly sarcastic, but I think this guy might actually be serious.
     Who knew that I could demand additional compensation to protect me
     from the risk that I might turn out to be an amoral felon?]

   <p>So: read and enter. If you win, I insist upon a cut of your fabulous
   prizes.

<h>It Didn't *Have* To Be A Joke...

   <p>Over at the Daily Kos, people are mocking the news that the Department
   of Labor has set up a website to help homeless people find jobs.
   <p>Kos: "No, it's not from the Onion."
   <p>Various commenters: "I can see it now, as the sad, homeless person
   lying under his newspaper in the park, covered with cardboard, powers
   up his Dell Laptop, logs on, and check the Opportunities forum."
   "There are over 30,000 homeless in NYC alone without WIFI service.
   Unconscionable..."
   <p>I don't actually think there's anything ridiculous about having a
   website set up to link homeless people with employment services and
   other government assistance programs. More homeless people have access
   to the Internet than you might think, through public libraries and
   homeless shelters - but, more importantly, a well-designed employment
   resource website would be invaluable to case managers, job coaches,
   and others who provide direct services to homeless people. My clients
   don't have home Internet access either (or, often, homes), but I do
   searches on their behalf all the time. I've been surprised by
   difficult it is to find up-to-date Internet information about local
   services. (Last two searches: an HIV support group for a heterosexual
   man; organized recreational activities for an adult with mild mental
   retardation. The support group was so impossible to find that I gave
   up and created one instead.) A comprehensive web directory would save
   me a hell of a lot of time and trouble.
   <p>So: no, it's not a bad idea. It is, however, a terrible website. There
   are links to Labor Department press releases and relevant employment
   laws. There are descriptions of targeted programs and service
   provision grants, neither of which include information (even telephone
   numbers) that would actually help clients access services. There's a
   link to a job search website designed for the general population - I
   couldn't find any information there about job training, supported
   employment, job coaching, or other special programs for people who
   aren't quite workforce-ready. Some obviously relevant information is
   missing: for example, links to the federally-funded state Departments
   of Vocational Rehabilitation, which provide employment services to
   people with disabilities.
   <p>The one thing on the page that seems genuinely useful is a link to an
   HHS website that helps case managers apply for federal benefits on
   behalf of their homeless clients. In other words, it's a resource that
   (a) already exists, (b) has nothing to do with the Labor Department,
   (c) is largely antithetical to the stated goal of helping homeless
   people find employment, and (d) is for service providers rather than
   clients.
   <p>If you want to know what the government is doing to help homeless
   people get jobs, this website is perfect. If you want to actually get
   a job for a homeless person, it's useless. So what we have here is
   nothing more than a government-funded advertisement for Bush's
   "compassionate conservatism," dressed up as a resource that actually
   helps the poor. I'm not surprised, but I am disgusted.

<h>Terror In The Skies!!!

   <p>We here at Respectful of Otters are having a lousy day at work.
   <p>Typing that, I am reminded that two previous lousy days at work have
   involved (a) a psychotic HIV-positive person bleeding on my desk from
   a self-inflicted wound, and (b) an erect penis I very much did not
   want to see. Considered in that light, today looks much better... and
   yet it's still been the kind of day that makes me want to retreat into
   fantasyland.
   <p>Annie Jacobsen, of "Women's Wall Street.com," is ready to oblige.
   <p>If you read World O'Crap, and you should, you're already familiar with
   the story. Essentially, Jacobsen and her husband were on a flight from
   Detroit to Los Angeles with a group of 14 Middle Eastern men. This
   seems to have been all that was needed to send her into a tizzy of
   racist paranoia:

     <p>As we sat waiting for the plane to finish boarding, we noticed
     another large group of Middle Eastern men boarding. The first man
     wore a dark suit and sunglasses. He sat in first class in seat 1A,
     the seat second-closest to the cockpit door. The other seven men
     walked into the coach cabin. As "aware" Americans, my husband and I
     exchanged glances, and then continued to get comfortable. I noticed
     some of the other passengers paying attention to the situation as
     well. As boarding continued, we watched as, one by one, most of the
     Middle Eastern men made eye contact with each other. They continued
     to look at each other and nod, as if they were all in agreement
     about something. I could tell that my husband was beginning to feel
     "anxious."

   <p>The Middle Eastern men continued to behave extremely suspiciously
   throughout the flight, provocatively chatting with each other, making
   eye contact, reading, possessing musical instrument cases, using the
   restroom, and failing to smile at the strange woman who had been
   keeping them under surveillance since they boarded. Apparently, at
   least one flight attendant was also caught up in Jacobson's anti-Arab
   hysteria, although some of those details are hard to believe. (For
   example: "About 20 minutes later the same flight attendant returned.
   Leaning over and whispering, she asked my husband to write a
   description of the yellow-shirted man sitting across from us. She
   explained it would look too suspicious if she wrote the information.
   She asked my husband to slip the note to her when he was done. ")
   <p>There is literally no way to make sense of Jacobsen's article if you
   don't start from the assumption that Middle Eastern men are
   terrorists. None. She complains that their carry-on luggage was not
   searched - by which she apparently means that it wasn't searched in
   front of her, at the gate, because all carry-ons go through security
   screening. She derives great drama from one of the men walking to the
   restroom with a bulging McDonald's bag and returning without it. (What
   do you do with trash you've brought onto an airplane? I suppose
   Jacobsen would hand it to a flight attendant, rather than throwing it
   out herself.) She finds it deeply suspicious that the men appeared to
   know each other, although they weren't sitting together. (I've been
   seated apart from my Significant Otter at times, when we were late
   arranging a flight. And we weren't trying to book a group of 14.)
   <p>When the Evil Terrorists got off the plane, they were met by the FBI -
   presumably the work of Jacobsen's flight attendant friend. Jacobsen
   and her husband gave a statement, and later called "Dave Adams, the
   Federal Air Marshal Services (FAM) Head of Public Affairs," who proved
   to be remarkably free with other airline passengers' travel
   information. He explained that the Middle Eastern men were all members
   of the same band, had clean records, and were traveling on the flight
   because of a legitimately confirmed gig. Jacobsen is still not
   satisfied:

     <p>So the question is... Do I think these men were musicians? I'll let
     you decide. But I wonder, if 19 terrorists can learn to fly
     airplanes into buildings, couldn't 14 terrorists learn to play
     instruments?

   <p>The right-wing blogosphere is predictably apoplectic, although there
   are also some reasonable exceptions. More sane commentary comes from
   the incomparable Sisyphus Shrugged and from Trish Wilson. The dramatic
   incident of the Coordinated Bathroom Visits is neatly disposed of by
   World O'Crap commenter Karin:

     <p>I have travelled in the Middle East and this sure sounds like
     prayer time to me. Muslims pray 5 times a day at specific times,
     and they perform ablutions(wash up) before they pray. That explains
     why everybody had to use the lav at the same time. Then they would
     have gone back and prayed quietly in their seats, or standing
     toegher in small groups in the aisle. I'm sure they were trying to
     be discreet about it, which ironically caused the passengers to get
     so paranoid.

   <p>The strangest part of the whole story, to me, is that Jacobsen and her
   supporters continue to maintain that what she observed was a terrorist
   attack in the planning, despite every piece of disconfirming evidence
   provided them. (They "appeared to know each other" because they did
   know each other - they were a large group traveling together but
   seated separately; they were carrying instrument cases because they
   were musicians; they were searched and investigated without turning up
   any evidence of evil intentions.) I suppose that I can understand how
   a nervous person might become frightened on the flight itself,
   especially with other people (including flight attendants) succumbing
   to hysteria. But it takes determined prejudices to remain convinced
   that death was narrowly averted even after a thorough security
   investigation revealed nothing.

<h>Security Vs. "Security"

   <p>Bruce Schneier relates a parable about the value of security measures:

     <p>The other week I visited the corporate headquarters of a large
     financial institution on Wall Street; let's call them FinCorp.
     FinCorp had pretty elaborate building security. Everyone --
     employees and visitors -- had to have their bags X-rayed.
     <p>Seemed silly to me, but I played along. There was a single guard
     watching the X-ray machine's monitor, and a line of people putting
     their bags onto the machine. The people themselves weren't searched
     at all. Even worse, no guard was watching the people. So when I
     walked with everyone else in line and just didn't put my bag onto
     the machine, no one noticed.
     <p>It was all good fun, and I very much enjoyed describing this to
     FinCorp's VP of Corporate Security. He explained to me that he got
     a $5 million rate reduction from his insurance company by
     installing that X-ray machine and having some dogs sniff around the
     building a couple of times a week.
     <p>I thought the building's security was a waste of money. It was
     actually a source of corporate profit.

   <p>Bruce's point is that, while every security measure is implemented for
   a good reason, the good reason involved often has nothing to do with
   security. The canonical modern example is the requirement that all
   airline passengers show a photo ID. There's nothing about showing
   photo ID that makes us safer, as was demonstrated on 9/11: every one
   of the hijackers had an acceptable photo ID. But the photo ID
   requirement does put the airlines in a better financial position.
   Prior to the ID requirement, it was possible to resell tickets you
   didn't plan to use, which meant lost revenue for the airlines. Now,
   private resale of airline tickets is impossible. The "security"
   measure was implemented to solve an economic problem, not a security
   problem.
   <p>Bruce was nice enough to send me a copy of his new book about
   security, Beyond Fear, after I posted about risk estimation a while
   back. I've been meaning to review it forever - maybe tomorrow evening?
   - but in the meantime, this story is a good sample.
   <p>(So where have I been, and why have I been neglecting my faithful
   readers? Um. Well, I've been busy, for one thing, but I've also been
   feeling somewhat depressed. When I'm in that state of mind, it's hard
   to muster the energy to go trolling through the worst sludge of the
   news looking for things to be outraged about, and harder still to
   believe that I have anything to say that's worth listening to. But I'm
   working on it, and I'll also work on keeping up with the posts. I
   don't want my readership to vanish completely.)

<h>Counting Book Readers

   <p>I'm not sure what to make of the new NEA survey heralding a decline in
   reading.

     <p>The survey sample â 17,135 people â makes it one of the largest
     studies ever conducted on the subject of arts participation, and
     the data were compared with similar studies from 1982 and 1992. In
     the literature segment respondents were asked whether they had,
     during the previous 12 months, without the impetus of a school or
     work assignment, read any novels, short stories, poems or plays in
     their leisure time.
     <p>Their answers show that just over half â 56.6 percent â read a book
     of any kind in the previous year, down from 60.9 percent a decade
     earlier. Readers of literature fell even more precipitously, to
     46.7 percent of the adult population, down from 54 percent in 1992
     and 56.9 percent in 1982, which means that in the last decade the
     erosion accelerated significantly.

   <p>These numbers strike me as odd, for a couple of reasons. In the first
   place: I was recently pointed towards a 1999 Gallup Poll lauding
   "continuing strong American reading habits." The 1999 poll found that
   85% of Americans had read a book of any kind in the previous year, and
   that 55% had read six or more books in the past year. Those results
   are dramatically at odds with the Census Bureau's report that in 1992
   only 60.9% of Americans read a book of any kind in the previous year,
   and that the percentage has been dropping since. The Times article
   also cites the Association of American Publisher's report that total
   sales of "consumer book products" increased 6% worldwide in 2003, a
   gain mostly attributed to increased sales of e-books and audiobooks.
   Who's buying all the books, if people have stopped reading?
   <p>In the second place: I grew up in a small ex-industrial city with
   three tiny, poorly stocked bookstores. Today my hometown supports an
   enormous Barnes & Noble as well as several smaller chains. Lots of
   small towns can report the same experience. More Americans have access
   to larger bookstores carrying more titles than ever before. How does
   the rise of the big-box-booksellers jibe with the supposed decline in
   reading? Again, from my own experience - when I lived in the suburbs,
   I could never get a close parking space at the library. My current
   urban library is always full of people, not just in the video section
   but deep in the stacks of the Humanities section. When I get on a
   commuter train in the morning, everyone's reading something. I'm not
   just talking about my own friends, who are all nerds - it seems to me,
   from my observation of the general population, that a moderate level
   of reading is widespread.
   <p>Patrick Nielsen Hayden made this point well in a 2001 interview:

     <p>What we really have is an immense explosion of options, so that no
     individual thing is selling nearly as well as the mass-market
     phenomena of the past. The Gallup Organization has done all these
     surveys of America's reading habits and established conclusively
     that despite all the cocktail-party cliches about literacy being on
     the decline, in fact most Americans are buying more books and
     reading more books and talking about more books, and generally
     being more bookish on an overwhelming level than ever before. It's
     all classes of Americans. It's not just computer books or self-help
     books or cat books. We're in an absolute commercial explosion of
     literary publishing. You couldn't have supported a Barnes & Noble
     the size of Rhode Island at every other suburban intersection
     thirty years ago.

   <p>I'm suspicious of arguments that the majority of people are stupid,
   uninformed, evil, or immoral, ranged up against a tiny minority of the
   righteous. In the circles in which I move, the claim that "most people
   don't read" is often cited as evidence for this worldview. One of the
   most vicious online arguments I ever had was with a man who maintained
   that "only one or two percent of Americans read anything at all," and
   I see that similarly extreme claims have even made it into published
   books. It's tempting to believe that our culture is going to hell, and
   that only a fast-diminishing remnant of civilization remains to hold
   back the outer darkness... I suppose.
   <p>So I don't know what to make of the Census Bureau survey.
   <p>The word "literature" is repeated so frequently in the New York Times
   piece about the survey that I begin to be suspicious about its
   meaning. It's a word with highbrow associations, and I wonder how the
   average person applies it. If the Census Bureau asks a voracious
   consumer of Harlequin Romances about her tastes in "literature," will
   she consider that it applies to her daily reading, or will she deny
   that she reads any literature at all? My suspicions are bolstered by
   the fact that the survey found reading to be highly correlated with
   visiting arts museums and attending performing arts events, and by the
   quotes from expert commenters. The chair of the NEA refers to
   "literary readers," not readers. History professor Kevin Starr talks
   about books in the context of "high culture," and notes that "You can
   get through American life and be very successful without anybody ever
   asking you whether Shylock is an anti-Semitic character or whether
   `Death in Venice' is better than `The Magic Mountain.'" Even before
   this "decline in reading," more people were reading Stephen King and
   Barbara Taylor Bradford than exquisite literary classics, and yet
   that's not the context in which the NEA and the New York Times are
   discussing the state of American letters.
   <p>Of the three books I'm currently reading (Ted Sturgeon's More Than
   Human, Dorothy Sayers' Busman's Honeymoon, and Anthony Trollope's
   Framley Parsonage) two are genre fiction (science fiction and
   mystery), and one is a 19th century novel which, I suppose, I could
   classify as "literary fiction." I suspect that only the third one
   counts as "literature" to the Times - I'm not sure about the Census
   Bureau. That's the only explanation I can think of for the discrepant
   results - anyone else?

<h>The Last Blogger On Earth To Post About Edwards

   <p>I'm quite pleased with Kerry's choice of John Edwards for VP, which
   nicely infuses Kerry's old-Washington credentials with a shot of
   energy from the future of the Democratic Party. Edwards was my second
   choice, after Dean dropped out, because I appreciated his vitality and
   his unabashedly liberal message. I think his charisma and eloquence
   will vastly improve the campaign. And Kos thinks that Edwards brings a
   big piece of the South back into play.
   <p>You won't be seeing much from me on the horse-race aspects of the
   election, because I simply don't have the expertise. Fortunately, the
   Daily Kos is your one-stop shopping center for electoral analysis. In
   particular, follow the links from this post to read Tom Schaller's
   thoughtful coverage of John Edwards.
   <p>With Edwards' nomination, expect the national hysteria over "tort
   reform" to reach a fever pitch. Slacktivist explains why the
   Republican strategy of using John Edwards as a poster boy for tort
   reform will backfire, given the particulars of Edwards' biggest
   courtroom triumph.

     <p>The defining case in Edwards' legal career wrapped up that same
     year. In 1993, a five-year-old girl named Valerie Lakey had been
     playing in a Wake County, N.C., wading pool when she became caught
     in an uncovered drain so forcefully that the suction pulled out
     most of her intestines. She survived but for the rest of her life
     will need to be hooked up to feeding tubes for 12 hours each night.
     <p>Edwards filed suit on the Lakeys' behalf against Sta-Rite
     Industries, the Wisconsin corporation that manufactured the drain.
     Attorneys describe his handling of the case as a virtuoso example
     of a trial layer bringing a negligent corporation to heel. Sta-Rite
     offered the Lakeys $100,000 to settle the case. Edwards passed.
     <p>Before trial, he discovered that 12 other children had suffered
     similar injuries from Sta-Rite drains. The company raised its offer
     to $1.25 million. Two weeks into the trial, they upped the figure
     to $8.5 million. Edwards declined the offer and asked for their
     insurance policy limit of $22.5 million. The day before the trial
     resumed from Christmas break, Sta-Rite countered with $17.5
     million. Again, Edwards said no.
     <p>On January 10, 1997, lawyers from across the state packed the
     courtroom to hear Edwards' closing argument, "the most impressive
     legal performance I have ever seen," recalls Dayton. Three days
     later, the jury found Sta-Rite guilty and liable for $25 million in
     economic damages (by state law, punitive damages could have tripled
     that amount). The company immediately settled for $25 million, the
     largest verdict in state history. For their part, Edwards and Kirby
     earned the Association of Trial Lawyers of America's national award
     for public service.

   <p>Never forget that the true aim of "tort reform" is to protect
   corporations that see no reason to modify their products after the
   first twelve children have their guts sucked out. Edwards' career as a
   trial lawyer is perfectly positioned to highlight the utter swindle
   that is the "tort reform" movement.
   <p>As Slacktivist says, "It is true that Americans despise lawyers, but
   only until they need a good one on their side. And that's really the
   question Americans ask about any given lawyer: Whose side is he on?
   Prompting Americans to ask that question about John Edwards would not
   be a wise move for his opponents in this campaign."

<h>Praying For Wal*Mart

   <p>The Respectful of Otters Military Advisory Board has informed me that
   the Carmelite Sisters of Indianapolis are praying about the Wal*Mart
   gender discrimination lawsuit this week.
   <p>There don't seem to be permalinks, but previous topics are archived. I
   liked this bit from 5/28/04, when the Sisters were reflecting on
   whether John Kerry should be denied Communion:

     <p>To deny someone that, would be the ultimate interference in that
     most important relationship [with Christ]. It would be as if one
     were to take upon themselves the role of Christâs "bouncers," a
     terribly arrogant role if I dare say so.

   <p>So, is the Respectful of Otters Military Advisory Board monitoring
   Wal*Mart, or nuns? I've learned not to ask those questions.

<h>"Their George And Ours"

   <p>Don't miss this incredible Fourth of July op-ed by my fellow Reed
   College alumna Barbara Ehrenreich.

     <p>George III is accused, for example, of "depriving us in many cases
     of the benefits of Trial by Jury." Our own George II has imprisoned
     two U.S. citizens â Jose Padilla and Yaser Esam Hamdi â since 2002,
     without benefit of trials, legal counsel or any opportunity to
     challenge the evidence against them. Even die-hard Tories Scalia
     and Rehnquist recently judged such executive hauteur intolerable.
     <p>It would be silly, of course, to overstate the parallels between
     1776 and 2004. The signers of the declaration were colonial
     subjects of a man they had come to see as a foreign king. One of
     their major grievances had to do with the tax burden imposed on
     them to support the king's wars. In contrast, our taxes have been
     reduced â especially for those who need the money least â and the
     huge costs of war sloughed off to our children and grandchildren.
     [...]
     <p>But the parallels are there, and undeniable. "He has affected to
     render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil
     power," the declaration said of George III, and today the military
     is indulgently allowed to investigate its own crimes in Iraq.
     George III "obstructed the Administration of Justice." Our George
     II has sought to evade judicial review by hiding detainees away in
     GuantÃ¡namo, and has steadfastly resisted the use of the Alien Tort
     Claims Act, which allows non-U.S. citizens to bring charges of
     human rights violations to U.S. courts.

   <p>No doubt, this piece will arouse all kinds of indignation from people
   who think it's "political hate speech" and dreadful hyperbole to
   compare George W. Bush to a known tyrant. But by the prevailing
   political standards of 1776, the American colonists weren't
   particularly oppressed and didn't have much to complain about. George
   III wasn't a Caligula or a Sun King. There was nothing unusually
   decadent or cruel about his reign. But American colonists had the bold
   vision that more was possible. They wanted to live with a degree of
   liberty and self-governance that had previously been unknown, and they
   were willing to risk everything in order to obtain it.
   <p>Ehrenreich closes with a sober reminder:

     <p>Today, those who believe that the war on terror requires the
     sacrifice of our liberties like to argue that "the Constitution is
     not a suicide pact." In a sense, however, the Declaration of
     Independence was precisely that.
     <p>By signing Jefferson's text, the signers of the declaration were
     putting their lives on the line. England was then the world's
     greatest military power, against which a bunch of provincial
     farmers had little chance of prevailing. Benjamin Franklin wasn't
     kidding around with his quip about hanging together or hanging
     separately. If the rebel American militias were beaten on the
     battlefield, their ringleaders could expect to be hanged as
     traitors.

   <p>On this Independence Day weekend, may we all find within ourselves the
   courage of our forebears.

<h>Is The Sky Falling? New CDC Guidelines For HIV Prevention

   <p>No fewer than four of my regular readers have written recently to ask
   me about the CDC's proposed guidelines for the content of HIV
   prevention literature, prompted by this terrifying Doug Ireland column
   in last week's L.A. Weekly:

     <p>Lethal new regulations from President Bushâs Centers for Disease
     Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, quietly issued with no
     fanfare last week, complete the right-wing Republicansâ goal of
     gutting HIV-prevention education in the United States. In place of
     effective, disease-preventing safe-sex education, little will soon
     remain except failed programs that denounce condom use, while
     teaching abstinence as the only way to prevent the spread of AIDS.

   <p>I've read the proposed new guidelines, and re-read the old 1992
   guidelines the new ones are meant to replace. Here are the main points
   where they differ:
   <l>(1) The content-review process established in the old guidelines is
   now extended to information posted on the web.
   <l>(2) The new guidelines require "medically accurate information
   regarding the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of condoms in
   preventing the sexually transmitted disease the materials are designed
   to address."
   <l>(3) The new guidelines clarify that program materials need to be
   judged acceptable by a community advisory board which reflects the
   demographics of the group being served, not just the demographics of
   the general population, and require that the advisory board be
   selected by the health department.
   <l>(4) The new guidelines specify that public health officials need to
   certify that the average person would not find the content of HIV
   prevention curricula "obscene" according to the Miller standard.
   <p>Items 2 and 4, obviously, are the ones that have Doug Ireland up in
   arms. Let's look at them one at a time.
   <p>Condoms: Ireland says, "they demand that all such materials include
   information on the 'lack of effectiveness of condom use' in preventing
   the spread of HIV and other STDs â in other words, the Bush
   administration wants AIDS fighters to tell people: Condoms donât
   work." But Ireland's tightly edited quote is a substantial distortion
   of the actual proposed guidelines, as you can see by comparing it to
   my item (2) above. Prevention materials are actually required to
   provide medically accurate information about condoms, whether that
   information focuses on their effectiveness (for example, in preventing
   HIV) or their lack of effectiveness (for example, in preventing
   herpes).
   <p>Here's what the CDC considers to be medically accurate information
   about condoms and HIV, taken from their own factsheet:

     <p>HIV, the virus that causes AIDS: Latex condoms, when used
     consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the
     sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
     <p>AIDS is, by far, the most deadly sexually transmitted disease, and
     considerably more scientific evidence exists regarding condom
     effectiveness for prevention of HIV infection than for other STDs.
     The body of research on the effectiveness of latex condoms in
     preventing sexual transmission of HIV is both comprehensive and
     conclusive. In fact, the ability of latex condoms to prevent
     transmission of HIV has been scientifically established in
     âreal-lifeâ studies of sexually active couples as well as in
     laboratory studies.

   <p>So the CDC is going to require that HIV prevention literature
   explicitly state that "condoms are highly effective in preventing the
   sexual transmission of HIV," that being the "comprehensive and
   conclusive" medical opinion. I'm okay with that. Nothing in the
   proposed guidelines for community organizations requires an
   "abstinence only" approach or devalues condoms as HIV prevention.
   Nothing. Ireland's extrapolating from the Bush Administration's
   preferred approach to high school sex-ed programs to interventions for
   high-risk communities, and that extrapolation is unwarranted.
   <p>Obscenity: Here's Ireland: "These new regs require the censoring of
   any 'content' [...] They require all such 'content' to eliminate
   anything even vaguely 'sexually suggestive' or 'obscene' â like
   teaching how to use a condom correctly by putting it on a dildo, or
   even a cucumber." With all due respect, that's simply nonsense.
   <p>The only place the phrase "sexually suggestive" appears in the new
   guidelines is the requirement that "educational sessions should not
   include activities in which attendees participate in sexually
   suggestive physical contact or actual sexual practices." And the
   guidelines specify that, although prevention materials are not
   supposed to directly promote either heterosexual or homosexual sex,
   that requirement "may not be construed to restrict the ability of an
   educational program [...] to provide accurate information about
   various means to reduce an individual's risk of exposure to, or to
   transmission of, the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency
   syndrome." In other words, it's perfectly allowable to teach people
   how to put on a condom.
   <p>The Miller standard for obscenity requires that an average member of
   the community would find the material "prurient" and "patently
   offensive," and that a reasonable person would find that the material
   has no scientific value (or artistic value, et cetera, but that's not
   important right now). It is by no means the case that all sexually
   explicit material is obscene according to the Miller test, yet Ireland
   writes about the proposed guidelines as if they prohibit any sexual
   explicitness in HIV prevention literature. Just as the "how to insert
   a tampon" line drawings inside every box of Tampax aren't considered
   prurient, and illustrated urology textbooks aren't considered patently
   offensive, "how to put on a condom" illustrations will certainly pass
   the Miller test.
   <p>Finally, Ireland complains that "the CDC will now take the decisions
   on which AIDS-fighting educational materials actually work away from
   those on the frontlines of the combat against the epidemic, and hand
   them over to political appointees," by which he means public health
   departments. As someone who does consulting work for a public health
   department, I'm insulted on behalf of my colleagues. Who the hell does
   Ireland think is "on the frontlines" if not the people who staff STD
   clinics and counseling and testing services?
   <p>At any rate, the guidelines specify that only one member of the review
   panel should be an employee of the health department, and that the
   rest should be representative members of the community being served.
   (Which means, for example, that you can't have a review panel made up
   of old white men deciding what information is appropriate for young
   black women.) Again, Ireland is extrapolating well beyond what the
   guidelines actually say.
   <p>There's plenty of outrage to be found in the Bush Administration's
   approach to HIV prevention - say, in their relentless pushing of
   abstinence-only sex ed programs for teenagers and their political
   scrutiny of NIH grants. It's not surprising that people immediately
   leap to think the worst of anything associated with the present
   government. But in this particular case, I think that Doug Ireland is
   frothing up a lot of public anxiety over very minor changes.
