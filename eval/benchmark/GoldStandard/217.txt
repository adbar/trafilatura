<h>CLASSICAL MILITARY STRATEGY AND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSEAir University Review, 
 
<h>Classical Military Strategy
and Ballistic Missile Defense 
 
 <p>The application of lessons of the past to current and predicted military issues 
always required a proper appreciation of changed technological conditions, but 
not until the latter half of the nineteenth century did the problem of 
adjustment offer any difficulties. In the twentieth century it became 
increasingly critical, and with the advent of nuclear weapons the entire value 
of past military experience as a guide to the future was called basically into 
question. 
 <p>Bernard Brodie 
 <p>THIS seems to be conventional wisdom: nuclear weapons have changed everything. 
Yet in many respects the nuclear age can be seen not as a break with past 
strategic theory but as the culmination of the evolution of strategy--the latest 
(and perhaps final) stage of military thought. While many tactical 
principles--whether of a general nature, such as the benefits offered by holding 
"interior lines," or of a specific nature, such as Frederick the Great's 
"oblique order of march"--may indeed by outdated, principles of grand strategy 
have continued to evolve. 
 <p>Military thinkers of the past were not necessarily wrong in their identification 
of underlying elements of grand strategy, but they may have been wrong in seeing 
those elements as constant and unchanging. Similar themes, ideas, and principles 
have seemed to recur in every conflict, but their recurrence over time was on a 
constantly ascending scale. In this article, I shall discuss specific instances 
to support this thesis, but at this point one other general thought needs to be 
considered. That is the idea that grand strategy developed differently in what 
we now call the Western nations (particularly in the United States) than it did 
in the Soviet Union. Although both are equally rooted in classical strategic 
theory and both are valid expressions of grand strategy, the strategies of 
today's East-West rivals, like races of men evolved from a single ancestor, 
gradually acquired distinctive features. With this in mind, let us examine the 
origins of U.S. nuclear strategy, then consider options to that strategy, and, 
finally, assess the impact of opposing choices on decisions for or against 
ballistic missile defense.
<h>Nuclear Strategy:
Links with the Past
       <p>As the magnitude of war increased, the need for political control over the 
      initiation, the extent, and the cessation of hostilities also increased.

   <p>Today . . . with truly cosmic forces harnessed to the machines of war, we have 
  a situation for the first time in history where the opening event by which a 
  great nation enters a war--an event which must reflect the preparations it has 
  made or failed to make beforehand--can decide irretrievably whether or not it 
  will continue to exist. Obviously, therefore, we cannot go on blithely letting 
  one group of specialists decide how to wage war and another decide when and to 
  what purpose, with only the most casual and spasmodic communication between 
  them.
   <p>War . . . is an act of policy. Were it a complete, untrammeled, absolute 
  manifestation of violence (as the pure concept would require), war would of 
  its own independent will usurp the place of policy the moment policy had 
  brought it into being; it would then drive policy out of office and rule by 
  the laws of its own nature. . . . It is clear, consequently, that war is not a 
  mere act of policy but a true political instrument, a continuation of 
  political activity by other means.
 <p>Clausewitz began his treatise On War with an exploration into the nature of war 
and examined it as a totally violent experience. To him, that was an abstract 
concept. With the present state of weapons evolution, it has become reality.
 <p>He then qualified his concept, however, and allowed that wars were not theory 
but reality, and in reality they are not fought merely for the sake of violence 
but to achieve political goals. Clausewitz also stressed that military aims had 
to be subjugated to political goals and that "this conception would be 
ineluctable even if war were total war." Today, in an era in which a first 
strike may be the entire war, domination of military aims by political goals is 
paramount not only in theory but in reality as well. In no nation today is the 
military given advance approval for first use of nuclear weapons. Historically 
(and even today regarding conventional weapons), military commanders have been 
authorized to fire back if fired upon. However, this authorization does not 
apply to nuclear weapons. For almost every contingency, advance approval for 
even second (or responsive) use of nuclear devices has been withheld. Because 
the destructive capacity of weaponry has increased to the point where policy 
controls military imperatives, Clausewitz's dictum has reached its purest form.
 <p>The main question, however, is whether there are any political goals that may be 
achieved by nuclear weapons. Hasn't the awesome power of such weapons canceled 
out any possibility that war can even be considered as a political instrument? 
That answer may also be found in Clausewitz and an examination of the evolution 
of military history, expressed as:
 <p>Political goals themselves must be realistic and not overreach military 
capabilities.
 <p>Clausewitz defined war as an "act of force to compel our enemy to do our will" 
and pointed out that mere destruction of forces or occupation of territory was 
sometimes insufficient to accomplish that goal. He noted his own native Prussia 
as an example where complete defeat and occupation (by Napoleon) nevertheless 
failed to effect a lasting change of will. To the contrary, Napoleon's 
overambitious political goals eventually led to significant, permanent changes 
mostly for his own country, France. The lessons of this are twofold: If an 
attacker realizes that by prosecuting a total war (versus a limited war) it may 
be in danger of allowing political goals to exceed military capability and 
thereby risking the destruction of itself, the very society it is attempting to 
impose or protect, then the attacker would be foolish to initiate the war at 
all; and if a defender is faced with the complete uprooting of the essence of 
its society, then it has nothing to fear by fighting to the bitter 
end--accepting total war as having no worse consequences than surrender.
 <p>History is replete with examples. Athens had every prospect of maintaining its 
empire ad infinitum until it decided to attempt complete hegemony in the middle 
of the Peloponnesian War by invading Sicily. By thus overreaching its military 
capability, the empire was lost. Likewise, Carthage had the strength to 
maintain its territory versus Rome, but by resorting to total war, it lost 
totally. When the third Punic War was over, "nine-tenths of the [Carthaginian] 
population had perished. . . . By order of the Roman Senate . . . [Carthage] was 
completely destroyed, and the survivors sold as slaves." The reason why no 
decisive "Napoleonic" victories were achieved in the American Civil War while 
they were won in the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars was not that 
weapons technology had given a decisive advantage to the defense (for the 
defending Europeans had weapons of equal destructive power), but that the North 
was attempting to impose a totally new order on the South, which caused an 
escalation to total war. In Europe, on the other hand, Bismarck and Moltke made 
it plain that their objectives were much more limited and not worth complete 
mutual destruction. In contrast, Napoleon and Hitler risked all and lost all by 
allowing political goals to exceed military capability in the face of 
adversaries who were fighting for the preservation of their very societies.
 <p>My point here is to suggest that because nuclear war today has evolved into what 
would be an act of total violence (a concept that for Clausewitz was merely 
abstract), it has crystallized the ultimate consequences, and therefore the 
choices, involved in total war. Where it was possible for Athens, Carthage, 
Napoleonic France, or Nazi Germany to mistakenly contemplate victory or at the 
worst (if defeated) a maintenance of the prewar status quo, such error in 
thought is no longer possible. By evolving to its pure form, war has identified 
its own consequences with absolute clarity. An attacker today does risk total 
destruction if it attacks a defender that can retaliate massively.
 <p>Recall that Clausewitz held that if war were a "complete, untrammeled, absolute 
manifestation of violence (as the pure concept would require), war would of its 
own independent will usurp the place of policy the moment policy had brought it 
into being." That is obviously true today and was equally true in the past. 
Certainly for Carthage and to a lesser extent for both Germany and Russia in 
World War II, the consequences of war rivaled the possible results of nuclear 
holocaust. The lesson is that war has not changed from being a practical 
political instrument into an impractical political instrument in the nuclear 
era, but that at its extreme it was always impractical. The difference is that 
as war's destructiveness has evolved in magnitude, this lesson has, been made 
obvious where before it was obscured. The only way to use war as a policy 
instrument now (as before) is by limiting its application--either by restraining 
political objectives or by increasing the effectiveness of defense.
<h>U.S. Strategy: A Preference
for the Offensive
 <p>Bernard Brodie instructs that "military doctrine is universally, and has been 
since the time of Napoleon, imbued with the 'spirit of the offensive.' " While 
the universality of his, statement may be criticized, it has certainly held true 
with regard to U.S. strategic thought. At the beginning of the Civil War, "the 
image of Napoleonic war with its brief, climactic battles had impressed itself 
upon the popular mind as well as upon soldiers . . . and it stimulated the usual 
popular impatience [especially in America] to have wars over with promptly." 
Nearly every one of the leading generals on both sides in the Civil War had been 
educated at West Point during an era when the strategic thought of Jomini, 
Napoleon's Swiss expositor, provided the bedrock of military instruction. Jomini 
made no secret of his preference for the offensive over the defensive and 
stressed that the whole purpose of strategy was to bring forces into battle with 
the object of destroying an enemy's army. Jomini called for boldness in warfare: 
"I would make [war] brisk, bold, impetuous, perhaps sometimes even audacious."
 <p>As U.S. military strategy began to be employed beyond its own borders, it was 
embodied in the Navy; and naval thought at the time for all of the great naval 
powers focused almost exclusively on the ideas of Alfred Thayer Mahan.
   <p>Mahan pored through the pages of Jomini in his effort to formulate a new 
  science of naval strategy, and many of the principles of naval war which he 
  suggested are naval applications of Jomini's precepts. 
   <p>Jomini's dictum that the organized forces of the enemy are the chief objective 
  pierces like a two-edged sword to the joints and marrow of many specious 
  propositions. . . . the enemy's ships and fleets are the true objects to be 
  assailed on all occasions.
 <p>As air power entered into U.S. strategic thought it was borne in the writings of 
Italian Brigadier General Giulio Douhet, a total proponent of the offensive. 
"His basic argument is two-fold: first, the nature of airpower requires that 
'command of the air' be won by aggressive bombing rather than by aerial 
fighting, and second, an air force which achieves command thereby ensures 
victory all down the line." He saw no hope for air defenses and every 
likelihood of rapid, total victory through bombardment of an enemy's cities and 
resources. It may be safely stated that there was not an atom of support for 
defenses in all his work.
 <p>The connection of Douhet to U.S. strategy was direct, via members of the Bolling 
Commission, who were considerably influenced by his concepts on a fact-finding 
tour examining military aviation during 1917; and indirect, in that Douhet 
merely expressed what was generally a consensus of knowledgeable Western opinion 
of that time. Subsequently, U.S. air doctrine "adopted Douhet's de-emphasis of 
fighters, whether for defense or for escort of bombers, and a corresponding 
emphasis on destroying the enemy's air force at its bases." Even General 
William "Billy" Mitchell's writing (although it is largely tactical and probably 
not derived from the Italian) is "pure Douhet" where it discusses the 
strategic use of air power.
 <p>As the United States entered the nuclear era, its choices seemed almost 
preordained. Although at first, both air defense and strategic bombing 
progressed together under Eisenhower's New Look strategy, clearly it was the 
offensive side that received the primary emphasis; and whatever balance existed 
did not survive the transition to the missile age. It was not the balanced 
offensive and defensive force structure advocated by Bernard Brodie in his 1959 
book, Strategy in the Missile Age, that was chosen, but rather the course 
advocated by Oskar Morgenstern in The Question of National Defense (also 1959), 
which advocated reliance on the creation of powerful strategic offensive 
forces. During the Kennedy-Johnson McNamara years, defenses against bombers 
were almost totally scrapped; and in the Nixon-Ford-Schlesinger years, 
antiballistic missile systems were given up as well.
 <p>As a result, the United States was left with an unnerving and rather absurd 
reliance on a strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD), trusting the fate of 
American society to the rationality of nuclear adversaries. It was said to be in 
our U.S. interest to forgo defenses totally in favor of the offense, making the 
nation vulnerable so that the other side would not suspect it of planning a 
first strike. To many observers, however, the MAD strategy was shortsighted. It 
ignored the possibility of technological breakthroughs that could render 
offensive forces themselves vulnerable and lead to dangerous consequences. Only 
in North America, where the ravages of war were largely unknown, could 
vulnerability have been conceived as an asset. As Henry Kissinger observed:
   <p>One reason [behind this strategy] was the growth of the school of thought to 
  which I, myself, contributed . . . which considered that strategic stability 
  was a military asset, and in which the historically amazing theory developed 
  that vulnerability contributed to peace and invulnerability contributed to 
  risks of war. Such a theory could develop and be widely accepted only in a 
  country that had never addressed the problem of the balance of power as a 
  historical phenomenon. And . . . only also on a continent which was looking 
  for any excuse to avoid analysis of the perils it was facing and that was 
  looking for an easy way out.
 <p>Adopting the MAD strategy, the United States consciously and willingly entrusted 
the fate of the nation to the Kremlin's self-restraint. For other nations such a 
policy would truly be considered "mad." "Since emphasis on active defense was 
nearly nonexistent, official policy [also] considered civil defense almost 
pointless. In short, U.S. nuclear decision-makers strove to retain sharp swords, 
but defensive shields were foregone."
<h>Alternative Evolutionary Patterns
 <p>While U.S. strategic thought has focused almost entirely on the offensive over 
the past century, options recognizing the benefits of defensive strategy have 
evolved in other societies, most notably in the Soviet Union. These options were 
also rooted in past strategic theory and practice.
 <p>In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Battle of Crécy between forces 
under Edward III of England and Philip VI of France demonstrated the ability of 
the English longbow to penetrate armor and overcome the theretofore unassailable 
dominance of mounted knights. For the first time in nearly a thousand years, 
defensive infantry gained the upper hand against mounted troops. Previously 
heavy cavalry, employed exclusively on the attack, had dominated warfare; and 
armies unfortunate enough to find themselves on the defensive had been forced to 
retreat inside fortresses and suffer the starvation and privation of siege. 
Thus, technological change opened a new era of military history; and since Crécy 
(with its verdict solidly reaffirmed 70 years later at Agincourt), "infantry has 
remained the primary element of ground combat forces."
 <p>Change indicated at Crécy, however, spread slowly to the armies of Europe. 
Decades passed before it began to impact military development in the Russian 
Empire, which at the time of Crécy was still being ravaged by mounted Mongolian 
armies. Nevertheless, the ascendancy of common infantry, emphasizing the 
strength of Russian numbers, along with defensive advantage offered by 
possession of vast territory for retreat and maneuver, was to have profound 
influence on the development of strategy in Russia.
 <p>In 1708-09, the tactical genius of Charles XII of Sweden took him into combat 
deep in the Ukraine, where Russian retreat, maneuver, and scorched-earth 
strategies brought the Swedish army to exhaustion and total defeat by a huge 
army under Peter the Great. A pattern of Russian strategy was thereby 
established. It accepted severe sacrifices in territory and lives while 
maintaining a strategic defensive to exhaust an adversary until he could be 
overwhelmed. That strategy continues to this day.
 <p>Even the great Napoleon, on whose campaigns offensive doctrine rests, 
experienced efeat from this simple but effective Russian strategy when he 
marched to Moscow in 1812. Although his final defeat was averted for some time; 
the final demise of his empire began when he crossed the Russian frontier and 
began pouring the resources of France upon empty steppes. The implications of 
this lesson were largely ignored by one great Napoleonic interpreter, Jomini, 
who chose instead to emphasize the magnificence of Napoleon's conquests. 
However, another interpreter, Clausewitz, understood the inherent strength of 
defensive strategy and chose to stress heavily that "defense is a stronger form 
of fighting than attack." Thus a divergence in strategic theory began that 
emphasized the differing geopolitical realities in East and West and evolved to 
the distinctly different military postures of today. These differences are 
particularly clear now that weapons for strategic defense are considered 
separately from those of strategic offense and conscious choices must be made 
regarding which type of system will receive budgetary allocations.
 <p>Defeat for Russia in World War I was inextricably intertwined with internal 
political collapse and revolution, but the civil war that followed found foreign 
expeditionary forces once more swallowed up by the vastness of the territory and 
the numerical superiority of a peasant army. In the Second World War, 
traditional Russian strategy was classically employed yet again as Hitler met a 
fate nearly identical to that of Charles XII and Napoleon. By accepting losses 
in both land and manpower that would have been disastrous for smaller nations, 
the Soviets absorbed the Nazi offensive thrust and husbanded its strength until 
a killing counterblow could be delivered. Clausewitz may not have approved of 
the crudity and inefficiency of the campaign, but he would have accepted the 
conclusion as inevitable.
 <p>In the nuclear age, the only change in fundamental Soviet strategy is that the 
counterblow will not be delayed. While great sacrifices undoubtedly will have to 
be made, this prospect is not a new idea. And at the same time that punishment 
is being accepted, it will be returned with overpowering force. However, aware 
that their nation has experienced the ravages of invasion many times in its 
history, the Soviets are not content to entrust their fate merely to the 
rationality of their adversary and the ability of their empire to accept and 
survive an onslaught. They intend to mount an active defense-in-depth and think 
it insane to do otherwise.
   <p>In the mid- to late-1950s, when the soviets were assessing what kind of 
  strategy and matching capabilities were required for war in the nuclear age, 
  an interlocking defense network composed of antiaircraft/antiballistic missile 
  systems and adequate protection for the civilian population and industry was 
  high on the list of priorities. . . . [A decade later, as Kosygin confessed to 
  Lyndon Johnson, the Soviets were] palpably mystified by the lack, after more 
  than two decades of strategic competition, of a coherent American doctrine and 
  strategy for attaining a meaningful victory out of nuclear war.
   <p>. . . the U.S. must look at Soviet defensive capability in terms of ballistic 
  missile defense, air defense, and civil defense. A recent Central Intelligence 
  Agency Study determined that Soviet civil defense efforts cannot neutralize 
  the U.S. response with nuclear weapons to a Soviet first strike. That study is 
  absolutely correct as far as it goes . . . but it misses the whole point. If 
  the Russians can achieve an antiballistic missile technology breakthrough and 
  add that to their active air defense capability, then civil defense takes on 
  an entirely different role. This is one reason why development of 
  high-energy-laser and charged-particle-beam weapons has become so important. . 
  . . The USSR does not have to have an air-tight defense but only the 
  capability to limit damage to an acceptable level as it perceives it. 
 <p>Thus Soviet strategy has developed on historically sound experience, yet in a 
way different from U.S. strategy. The Soviets do not dismiss war and the huge 
loss it will bring as "unthinkable." They accept that it might occur, make plans 
to keep the damage to acceptable levels (by their standards), and build weaponry 
capable of delivering a killing blow to their opponent.
<h>Prescriptions for Change
 <p>History seems to show that a balance between offensive and defensive capability 
is needed. As a Royal Air Force officer, reflecting on Douhet's theories after 
the Battle of Britain, commented: "If it is true that 'the bomber will always 
get through,' as it is popularly stated, it is equally true that 'not all the 
bombers will get through' against adequate defenses." With proper emphasis and 
investment in research, the same observation could be made regarding strategic 
missiles. And as the various elements of both active and passive defense are 
brought together, the contribution of each will be multiplied. It is only by 
looking at the "whole" effect of defense along with the effects from offensive 
action that strategic possibilities can be examined realistically.
 <p>A second historical lesson applicable to today's choices between strategies and 
their associated specialized weapons systems is the realization that military 
means must be related to political ends. This fundamental Clausewitzian precept 
has often been forgotten at great cost in the past. In World War I, for example, 
"Foch gives little indications in his writings of having thought about the 
matter at all.... Yet if the total war of the future is fated to be one where 
victory is pursued blindly, and therefore at wholly incommensurate costs which 
destroy its meaning, it will be more akin to the first than the second of the 
two world wars." Once a nation is equipped with sufficient offensive arms to 
obliterate its potential adversaries, further increases in offensive weaponry 
add little to security or the advancement of political goals. The cost of 
multiplying this offensive firepower is simply disproportionately high to the 
benefits derived.
 <p>But that is not true of defensive investment--particularly in the United States 
where so little defense exists. In fact, initial expenditures on defensive 
measures would probably bring the highest return for U.S. military dollars 
because there is so much room for investment before the onset of diminishing 
returns.
 <p>In the first place, active defenses could help protect U.S. strategic offensive 
weapons, hopefully destroying a portion of any Soviet attack capability launched 
against counterforce targets and preserving U.S. retaliatory might. Results 
following a Soviet first strike might therefore not reflect such a gross 
asymmetry in favor of the U.S.S.R. as is currently contemplated. To Bernard 
Brodie, this point constitutes a basic principle about defense in general:
   <p>Known ability to defend our retaliatory force constitutes the only 
  unilaterally attainable situation that provides potentially a perfect defense 
  of our homeland. Conversely, a conspicuous inability or unreadiness to defend 
  our retaliatory force must tend to provoke the opponent to destroy it; in 
  other words, it tempts him to an aggression he might not otherwise 
  contemplate.
 <p>Second, active defense offers a realistic possibility--perhaps the only 
realistic possibility--of reducing or eliminating the frightening specter of 
nuclear holocaust that has haunted most of the world for over three decades. One 
approach might be for both sides to develop massive and highly effective 
defenses on a scale of both quantity and quality that could meet and destroy any 
combination of nuclear attack launched against them. By using various weapons 
and tactics, such defenses would reduce the effectiveness of offensive systems 
so drastically that a climate and a motive conducive to disarmament could 
result. Such a development, however, envisions a highly optimistic evolution of 
defensive versus offensive weaponry, which is historically and logically 
questionable. It would be better to assume that if both offensive and defensive 
weaponry continue to be developed, each will contain elements of strength and 
weakness with neither achieving total dominance. In such an event, defenses 
would contribute to deterrence only to the extent that greater uncertainty was 
introduced to offensive planning. Nuclear attack would be forestalled by 
eliminating certainty of destruction and replacing it with less quantifiable 
probabilities.
 <p>Another (more realistic) way of eliminating the specter of nuclear war would be 
for defensive strategies to be employed along with negotiated arms reductions. 
Assuming that reductions in strategic nuclear weapons will be approved 
eventually by both the United States and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that 
ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems would multiply the effect of such 
reductions. It is generally held that the primary problem with BMD is the sheer 
mass of incoming missiles that would have to be faced in a short time. If the 
numbers were reduced, associated defensive solutions would be more viable. Even 
first-generation ABMs (Sprint/Safeguard) were touted as possessing good 
capability against limited or Nth-country (China) attacks. Eventually, if both 
sides drew down to, say, 200 launchers, defensive weapons might begin to achieve 
virtually certain protection. Furthermore, any reluctance to take the final step 
beyond reductions to total nuclear disarmarnent, stemming from a desire to 
retain at least limited options to employ weapons of mass destruction in times 
of crisis, might be overcome. Where without defenses there could be great 
misgivings about total nuclear disarmament, if it could be shown that small 
offensive weapons reserves were useless in the face of effective defenses, 
incentives would exist to continue the arms reduction process. In other words, 
defensive weapons would promote both a climate and a motive for disarmament by 
eliminating any threat of surprise. Such prospects however, depend on the 
development of defensive systems on both sides before they are needed. 
Obviously, the sooner development can begin, the better.
 <p>IN summary, then, one can see that the fundamentals of current grand strategies 
are deeply rooted in past strategic theory and, in fact, represent the 
culmination of classical theory in its purest form. A distinct difference 
between U.S. and Soviet strategic doctrine exists, with the United States 
preferring to stress the offensive while the Soviets pursue a more balanced 
approach. To remove Soviet temptation to strike at vulnerable U.S. weapons and 
to serve as a "multiplier" to any arms reductions, U.S. adoption of some 
elements of defensive strategy and development of associated weaponry seem 
reasonable and worthwhile.
 <p>Admittedly, there are those who claim that BMD is destabilizing. They point out 
that if either nation perceives the other to be gaining a technological 
breakthrough--deploying defensive systems unilaterally and gaining protection 
that the other cannot obtain--it may feel forced to launch a preemptive strike 
before such defenses could be set in place. Such arguments, however, do not 
militate against U.S. development of BMD but only against the manner and timing 
 <p>If the United States finds itself facing a numerically superior nuclear force 
capable of destroying two legs of its triad (ICBMs and bombers), Soviet 
temptation to strike at this area of vulnerability, as pointed out by Bernard 
Brodie, might provide a motive for attack. If such a Soviet force were augmented 
by comprehensive antimissile defenses, that motive would be even stronger 
because the means of negating a substantial portion of the remaining U.S. 
weapons, the SLBMs, would be in hand. The United States would, in effect, face 
forceful cancellation of its strategic forces altogether by the offensive and 
defensive combination of Soviet arms.
 <p>If, on the other hand, the United States pushed ahead as rapidly as possible 
with research and development, then unilateral deployment of BMD systems by the 
Soviets would be obviated by U.S. ability to deploy similar systems apace. Once 
both nations have defensive systems in place, those systems will begin to 
produce the beneficial, stabilizing effects discussed earlier. The issue is how 
to get safety from here to there. Clearly, however, if the United States attains 
the capability to deploy effective BMD weapons, then it can set the pace for 
mutual deployment; if it is not in a position to keep up with the Soviets, 
however, the United States will be faced with the uncomfortable possibility that 
the Soviets may not be willing to modify or restrain their deployment schedule.
 <p>In the end, however, the debate could be moot. Given the present state of 
research and development of various forms of BMD on both sides and the 
investment emphasis placed on pushing those programs ahead, defensive systems 
for both of the superpowers could be developed at about the same time. If the 
United States accepts the importance and logic of strategic defenses as the 
Soviets have, it might only be necessary for each nation to pursue diplomatic 
contacts and intelligence gathering to ensure themselves that no short-term, 
unilateral disadvantages developed. Regardless of the likelihood of concurrent 
timing, it is clear that the United States should pursue antimissile defense as 
vigorously as possible, recognizing that it is the only type of strategic 
program still capable of matching political goals with military aims. The 
inertia of U.S. preference for offensive strategy, whether disguised as theories 
such as mutual assured destruction or pseudoscientific investigations such as
