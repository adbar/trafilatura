<p>After a teenager in Covington, Washington, turned his father in for growing 
marijuana, local TV news reporters and daily newspapers fell all over themselves 
calling him a hero. Was I the only pot-smoking parent who was horrified?
<p>KIRO 7 Eyewitness News reporter Karen O'Leary does sanctimonious piety better 
than anyone else in local television news--and that's saying something. As a 
group, TV news reporters excel at sanctimonious piety, especially when a story 
involves drugs. Last week O'Leary, a.k.a. Our Lady of the Pursed Lips, reported 
on "a drug bust turned into a family affair." Aaron Palmer of Covington, 
Washington, was turned in to the police by his 17-year-old son for growing pot 
in his garage.
<p>"Neighbors say the kid is responsible and hardworking, a member of the ROTC 
program," the scowling O'Leary intoned at the beginning of KIRO's coverage. 
Palmer was arrested late Tuesday night, and O'Leary was on the air Thursday with 
an exclusive interview with Trevor, "[who] told me about his gut-wrenching 
decision and the fallout from it."
<p>Cut to Trevor, the busted dad's clean-cut 17-year-old son. Trevor showed O'Leary 
and her camera crew around his father's garage, the spot where his father was 
allegedly growing pot.
<p>"It's messed-up," Trevor said, complaining about the King County cops who busted 
his father, tearing his house apart in the process. "They trashed it too 
thrashed."
<p>Apparently no one warned Trevor that cops called out on a drug bust don't tiptoe 
through the grow room, or any other room in a suspect's house. Like all kids his 
age in Covington, Trevor is likely to be a "graduate" of Drug Awareness 
Resistance Education (DARE), a class taught by smiling uniformed police 
officers. In DARE classes, cops tell kids that marijuana destroys lives, people 
who smoke marijuana need help, and cops are the good guys who can provide that 
help. DARE doesn't warn kids that calling the police on their own parents--as 
DARE graduates all over the country have done--can result in their homes being 
torn apart.
<p>Trevor shook his head and looked grim.
<p>"It was affecting his behavior. It was starting to take over his life," Trevor 
said, sounding like a DARE pamphlet.
<p>"One of Trevor's biggest concerns now," O'Leary broke in, "is that he knows his 
dad will find out that he was the one who turned him in. That's because the 
sheriff's department reported it in a press release."
<p>"He's going to blame me," said Trevor, who does a pretty good version of 
sanctimonious piety himself. "It's one of those fatherhood things. You want your 
kids to look up to you, not turn you in."
<p>"A very strong young man," O'Leary said at the end of her report.
<p>There's so much wrong with the story of the Covington teenager who turned in his 
dad for growing pot that I hardly know where to begin. O'Leary's performance on 
KIRO seems as good a place as any to start: People who work in mainstream media 
like to brag about their objectivity, their fair and balanced reporting. Over 
here in the alternative press, we get both sides of a story but we're allowed to 
take positions (repeal the Teen Dance Ordinance) and we're not afraid to grind 
our favored axes (build the monorail), unlike the men and women at daily papers 
and on television news broadcasts who pride themselves on being objective and 
balanced.
<p>Except when it comes to drugs.
<p>O'Leary's reporting on KIRO was a lot of things--hysterical, melodramatic, 
sensationalistic--but balanced wasn't one of them. The police said Aaron Palmer 
had "at least 40 plants," "bags of dried and ready-to-sell marijuana," and 
"scales to measure the crop."
<p>But Aaron Palmer's lawyer disputes the police account. "Forty plants is a gross 
exaggeration of the actual number of plants recovered or seized," said Lisa 
Podell, the criminal defense attorney representing Aaron Palmer. Also missing 
from O'Leary's report was the reason why Aaron Palmer was growing pot. "Mr. 
Palmer uses marijuana for medicinal purposes," Podell told me. "He's got bad 
arthritis, knee problems, and back problems." Palmer's doctors were aware that 
he was using marijuana to treat his pain, according to Podell. Also missing from 
O'Leary's report was the fact that Washington state voters approved a medical 
marijuana initiative in 1998.
<p>Confronted with a chilling account of a kid turning in his own father to the 
police, KIRO, KING 5, KOMO, Q13, and both daily papers stuck to the drug war 
script: People who use pot, very bad; people who grow pot, even worse. Aaron 
Palmer, Drug Lord. His son Trevor, Brave Young Man. If the cops say it was a 
commercial operation, it was a commercial operation. If the police praise a 
teenager for turning in his parent, then turning in your parents for having pot 
in the house is praiseworthy. The mainstream media is terrified of deviating 
from the drug war script, but is it too much to ask the mainstream media to get 
its facts straight? For instance, The Seattle Times reported that Aaron Palmer 
had been previously convicted of a drug felony, which isn't true, according to 
Palmer's lawyer. Guns were found in Palmer's home, as was widely reported, but 
they were locked in a safe and may yet prove to have been legally registered.
<p>So where's the other side of the story the mainstream media is always promising 
us? Not just Aaron Palmer's denials that he was selling marijuana, but the other 
side of the pot story?
<p>Comments from people who don't think marijuana is a dangerous drug were missing 
from every local news report I saw about Aaron Palmer's arrest. News "consumers" 
in Seattle and Washington state who rely solely on the mainstream media for 
information may not even be aware that there is another side to the pot story. 
So I suppose I shouldn't have been shocked when Keith Stroup, the executive 
director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), 
told me I was the first reporter to call from Washington state seeking a comment 
about Trevor and Aaron Palmer.
<p>"Whenever the public hears about someone who has kids having pot in the house, 
they get their backs up," said Stroup from NORML's Washington, D.C. offices. 
"But just because you smoke a joint doesn't mean you're not a good, loving, 
concerned parent."
<p>Had the daily papers or TV "journalists" bothered to call someone like Stroup, 
they would've been able to offer their viewers and readers some balance and a 
little context: "Seventy-six million Americans, one out of three adults, have 
smoked marijuana," Stroup told me. "The vast majority of these people are good 
citizens, people who work hard and take care of their families. The problem is 
our laws, not good, responsible people who like to smoke marijuana."
<p>Stroup told me of other cases in which children turned in their parents for 
growing or smoking pot.
<p>"These thing are always sad," said Stroup. "When I hear of one of these cases 
where a child turns in his parent, I'm distressed by the damage done to the 
family." Fifty-seven years old, Stroup went to grade school during some of the 
darkest moments of the Cold War. "We were constantly told how bad it was in the 
Soviet Union," said Stroup, "and one of the things that was so awful about the 
Soviet Union was that Soviet kids were encouraged to report their parents to the 
police. A police officer was quoted in regards to the Covington story saying 
that the kid 'did the right thing.' Similar things were no doubt said about 
children in the Soviet Union who got their parents arrested. The result is, 
you've got a single father locked up, and a family fractured forever. It's hard 
to imagine why this should be the case. Who's been helped by this?"
<p>Like me, Stroup suspects that Aaron Palmer's son was exposed to DARE propaganda 
at an impressionable age. Seven years ago, when Trevor was in fifth grade, the 
schools in Covington had DARE programs.
"A law-enforcement officer comes into a fifth-grade classroom and tells children 
how bad marijuana is," said Stroup. "DARE tends to place a special emphasis on 
marijuana, since that is the drug school-age children are most likely to 
experiment with."
<p>Instead of telling kids the truth about the drug--the truth is far too positive, 
and we'll get to it in a moment--DARE officers are free to say what they like, 
and many, if not most, fill kids' heads with lies and horror stories: Marijuana 
is addictive; smoke marijuana on Monday and you'll be addicted to heroin by 
Thursday; all marijuana users wind up in jail; pot will ruin your life.
<p>"Then they ask kids to be on the lookout for things in their own homes," said 
Stroup. "Every year in this country, a handful of kids, many meaning well, find 
rolling papers or a roach clip in their parents' rooms, and they become 
frightened to death that their parents are drug addicts, and they turn their 
parents in to the 'friendly' officer who lectured them about the dangers of 
drugs."
<p>The DARE kids who turn their parents into the police--some have been as young as 
10--expect their parents to get a lecture from a friendly DARE officer about the 
dangers of marijuana, just like they did at school.
<p>"What the parents get, however, is arrested," said Stroup. "People who are good 
parents--good parents who happen to smoke marijuana--have lost custody of their 
children. Families have been torn apart."
<p>Kitty Tucker's family was torn apart in 1999 when her 16-year-old daughter 
turned her in to the police for growing marijuana in her home. Tucker and her 
family lived in Takoma Park, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C., and one 
morning she had a confrontation with her daughter. The girl had stayed out all 
night, so her mother grounded her. Furious, Tucker's daughter called the police 
to retaliate. "My daughter was scolded for misbehavior," Tucker told me on the 
phone from her home, "so she called the cops, thinking they would scold us."
<p>"Our home was invaded by policemen without a warrant," said Tucker, "and they 
took away my plants." Tucker suffers from debilitating migraines and a painful 
neurological disorder called fibromyalgia, and smoked marijuana to treat her 
pain. Tucker's husband, who didn't smoke marijuana, was fired from his job with 
the Department of Energy. Both were prosecuted for growing marijuana. Tucker and 
her husband eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and were placed on 
probation.
<p>Four years ago, when I was about to adopt my son, I worried that he would wind 
up in DARE classes when he reached the fifth grade. What if he found out I 
occasionally smoked pot and turned me in? What if he found pot growing in the 
basement of some friend's house and turned the friend in? Thankfully, in the 
last four years DARE programs have fallen from favor. Research into DARE's 
programs found them to be ineffective at best. A University of Kentucky study 
found that DARE had no measurable impact on later drug use; a six-year study at 
the University of Illinois found that children who had been subjected to DARE's 
scare tactics were more likely to use drugs in high school than kids who hadn't. 
The Seattle Police Department got out of the DARE program in 1998; Covington 
Elementary School (part of the Kent School District) dropped out of DARE two 
years ago. Of course, DARE might not be to blame. Trevor is a 17-year-old 
high-school senior after all, not a 10-year-old fifth grader. It could be that 
Aaron Palmer's son, like Kitty Tucker's daughter, was simply pissed at his dad 
for something and called the cops out of spite. The mainstream reporters in 
Seattle were too busy falling all over themselves praising Trevor to pause and 
consider his motives. Couldn't he be a vengeful adolescent lashing out at his 
full-time parent?
<p>Many of us who don't fit the pot-smoking stereotype are reluctant to be open 
about our pot use. Considering pot's illegality and the stigma associated with 
its use, it's understandable that the average user might not want to go public. 
Unfortunately, the silence of casual pot smokers when other marijuana users or 
dealers get busted is helping to keep the War on Drugs roaring along. So I'm 
going to risk telling the truth: I am a pot smoker--and I don't fit the 
stereotype. I don't wear hemp; I don't have dreads; I don't think deodorant is a 
plot; I don't smoke pot on a daily basis; I don't have glaucoma; and I didn't 
vote for Ralph Nader. And unlike most people who've "experimented" with pot, I 
didn't start in my teens. I didn't smoke pot for the first time until I was in 
my 30s. (Note to The Seattle Times: One of the very first times I smoked pot was 
with one of your reporters.)
<p>Here's what my pot use looks like: Every once in a great while, when my son is 
spending the night with his grandparents or sleeping over at a friend's house, 
my boyfriend and I rent some videos, lay in some ice cream and potato chips, and 
obtain one--one!--measly joint from a close friend. We put in a video, crawl 
into bed, get baked, and eat Doritos. We do this once or twice a year. We don't 
grow pot, we don't keep it in the house. Did I say I don't smoke pot daily? It 
would be more accurate to say that I sometimes don't even get around to smoking 
pot biannually.
<p>According to the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, I'm one of the 20 
million Americans who use marijuana at least once a year; 6 million use it at 
least once a week, and 3 million Americans smoke marijuana daily. The NHSDA puts 
current national consumption of marijuana at 7 to 10 million joints per day, or 
1,200 to 1,800 metric tons per year. These figures may be low, since most 
researchers believe the NHSDA underestimated actual drug use. ("Hello, I'm from 
the federal government. Maybe you've heard of our War on Drugs? Hey, we were 
just wondering how much dope you guys have been smoking lately?")
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Americans spent 
more than $11 billion on pot in 1998. Marijuana is the fourth largest cash crop 
in the United States, behind corn, soybeans, and hay. It's the biggest cash crop 
in Alabama, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Rhode Island, 
Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia--and apparently Covington, Washington. 
"Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in America today, and is 
readily available throughout all metropolitan, suburban, and rural areas of the 
continental United States," according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
<p>The federal government and state governments will spend $40 billion this year in 
the war on drugs, with billions spent on the fight against marijuana, which the 
government insists is a dangerous drug.
<p>The only trouble with the United States' war on pot is that pot is neither 
addictive nor dangerous--especially when compared with other, legal drugs. The 
government's anti-pot message is undermined by the life experiences of millions 
of Americans who have used pot and suffered no negative consequences. Meanwhile, 
50,000 Americans die every year from alcohol poisoning; 16,653 people were 
killed by drunk drivers in 2000, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving; 
25,000 Americans die every year of cirrhosis of the liver. Cigarette-related 
illnesses kill 400,000 Americans every year. Despite what the Partnership for a 
Drug-Free America would have us believe, it's simply impossible to overdose on 
marijuana. According to the Lancet, a European medical journal, "the smoking of 
cannabis, even long-term, is not harmful to health.... It would be reasonable to 
judge cannabis as less of a threat than alcohol or cigarettes."
<p>While the mainstream media in the United States is inclined to praise a kid like 
Trevor ("hardworking," "a very strong young man," "brave"), mainstream media 
outlets in Canada are actively encouraging their government's moves toward 
marijuana decriminalization. When British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Advisory 
Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that "all cannabis 
preparations" be essentially decriminalized, the report was greeted with 
enthusiasm by the media. "The high use of cannabis is not associated with major 
health problems for the individual or society," says the British government, 
"[and] the occasional use of cannabis is only rarely associated with significant 
problems in otherwise healthy individuals." According to London's Evening 
Standard, "[the ACMD] makes it clear that alcohol is far more damaging than 
cannabis to health and society at large because it encourages risk-taking and 
leads to aggressive and violent behavior."
<p>The Brits haven't discovered something we don't already know. In 1972, Richard 
Nixon's National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse recommended that 
marijuana use and possession be decriminalized; in 1982, the National Academy of 
Sciences not only recommended that marijuana use and possession be 
decriminalized, but that lawmakers "give serious consideration to creating a 
system of regulated distribution." In 2000, a long-term study conducted by 
Kaiser Permanente found that not only was there no link between regular 
marijuana use and death, but that "marijuana prohibition presented the only 
significant health risk to the user." (Don't believe Kaiser? Ask anyone who was 
raped in a holding cell after being picked up for marijuana possession.) Kaiser 
recommended that "medical guidelines regarding prudent use... be established, 
akin to the common-sense guidelines that apply to alcohol use."
<p>So here's the story that KIRO, KING, KOMO, Q13, The Seattle Times and the 
Seattle Post-Intelligencer all missed: Pot isn't a threat to our health. The pot 
plants growing in Aaron Palmer's garage were less of a threat to his son Trevor 
than the case of beer in his fridge or the cigarettes for sale down the street.
<p>Here's the story the mainstream media wanted to sell us about Aaron Palmer: He's 
a drug dealer. Never mind that Palmer denies dealing pot, never mind that he may 
have been growing pot for a legitimate and voter-approved medicinal use, and 
never mind that the recreational use of pot is harmless.
<p>But suppose for a moment that Aaron Palmer was selling pot for profit--is that 
so awful? If using pot is harmless, why is dealing pot so awful? If there's no 
harm in consumption, how can there be harm in production and distribution?
<p>"There's this absurd distinction," said Keith Stroup of NORML. "If you have an 
ounce or less, that's okay. But, my goodness, if you buy two ounces and sell one 
to a friend, you're an evil dealer.... But the reality is, if someone didn't 
take the risk of selling, none of us could buy."
<p>That drug warriors are eager to lock up pot dealers comes as no surprise; what 
is surprising is the passivity of marijuana smokers when our dealers get busted. 
For pot smokers, the dealer is a Very Important Person, someone who vastly 
improves a pot smoker's quality of life. So how come there isn't more anger from 
everyday users when dealers get busted?
<p>"Selling is different from buying," a daily pot smoker told me. Although he 
works in a field in which drug use can be assumed, the daily pot smoker would 
only speak to me if I promised not to use his name. We'll call him Henry. 
"Dealers run a much bigger risk, and they know it." And there's always another 
pot dealer out there, Henry points out. When one dealer gets busted, you move on 
to a new source. "I might get attached to a coffee shop in my neighborhood, but 
when it goes out of business, I move on to some other coffee shop. I don't mourn 
the shop."
<p>Valid point, as far as it goes--which isn't far. When a coffee shop goes under, 
its owners aren't sent to prison for 10 or 20 years for meeting your cravings 
for caffeine.
<p>To the hundreds of thousands of people in Seattle and across Washington state 
who smoke dope, I'd like to say this: Pot doesn't appear under our pillows in 
the middle of the night, left there for us by the Pot Fairy. Someone has to grow 
it and someone has to sell it, or no one can smoke it. In an ideal world, there 
would be a safe, legal, regulated marijuana market, and we could buy pot in 
cafés or state-run stores. But unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal 
world--we live in the United States of America. While a legal, safe, regulated 
marijuana supply would be nice, no one I know who smokes pot is willing to wait 
on decriminalization. We want our pot, and we want it now, and we're quick to 
anger when people get busted for smoking pot or possessing small quantities for 
"personal use." (704,812 Americans were arrested for pot offenses in 1999, the 
most recent year that figures are available.)
<p>But none of us makes a peep when someone gets arrested for selling pot.
<p>This is, in a word, crap. When pot dealers get busted, pot smokers shrug and 
move on to the next dealer, and sanctimonious TV newscasters cluck their 
tongues, purse their lips, and shake their heads. (Does anyone for a moment 
doubt that someone in the KIRO newsroom is a pothead? Or that there isn't at 
least one small pipe hidden in someone's desk at The Seattle Times?) If I may 
borrow a catchphrase from the 1996 Dole for President campaign: Where's the 
outrage? Every day in the United States people who sell a harmless "drug" (and a 
plant that grows wild all over North America), a drug that's much less 
destructive than alcohol, are arrested, prosecuted, and sent to prison for 10 or 
20 years, or even longer. If American pot smokers had any integrity--if we were 
willing to put some of our money where our mouths are--we would create legal 
defense funds for busted pot dealers.
<p>"No kid should have to grow up that fast," Trevor told KIRO's Karen O'Leary.
<p>Watching Trevor on the news, I wanted to reach through the television set and 
choke him. Trevor was the picture of the preening, tormented adolescent, equal 
parts self-righteousness and self-pity.
<p>"This sucks," Trevor told Q13 news. "Everyone I'm related to thinks I'm the bad 
guy. But everyone else... thinks I'm a hero."
<p>Not everyone outside your family thinks you're a hero, Trevor. Sure, the Seattle 
Post-Intelligencer published an editorial on Monday praising your bravery and 
suggesting that "a local civic or service organization" offer you a scholarship 
(and once again mentioned your dad's guns without mentioning the safe they were 
in), but there are a lot of us out here who think you're a complete asshole. Oh, 
there may be situations in which a father or a son or a brother is morally 
obligated to turn in a family member: The father of Luke Helder, the Midwestern 
smiley-face pipe bomber, did the right thing; David Kaczynski did the right 
thing when he helped lead the police to his brother Ted, the Unabomber. But in 
both those instances lives were at stake.
<p>Despite what you were told in your DARE classes, Trevor, your dad wasn't hurting 
anyone--not even himself. All your dad was doing, Trevor, was growing some 
pot--harmless, non-addictive pot. He wasn't forcing it on you, your siblings, or 
anyone else. Although what your dad was doing was against the law, the law in 
this case is unjust and idiotic. We have a moral right to resist and break 
unjust laws, something they may not have covered in your ROTC classes.
<p>"He's going to blame me, I know it," Trevor whined.
<p>Yeah, well, I suppose so. You are the one who called the cops on your father, 
after all. Who's he supposed to blame? Osama? You could've called your mother, 
you could've moved out. If you felt your dad was smoking too much dope, you 
could've called some of his friends over to stage an intervention. There were 
other options. But you called the cops, turned in your dad, and then watched as 
cops burst into your home, tore the place apart, and hauled your father--and 
your 15-year-old sister's father, and your seven-year-old brother's 
father--away. Your dad was a single parent; while you're old enough to be on 
your own, your seven-year-old brother isn't. So you not only forever fucked your 
relationship with your father, but you may have fucked your siblings out of a 
father. Nice work, Trev.
<p>Maybe the DARE people will send you a T-shirt.
