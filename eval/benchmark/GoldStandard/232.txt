Rights and Responsibilities of Test Takers: Guidelines and Expectations
                  
             

             
            <h>Rights and Responsibilities of Test Takers: Guidelines and 
            Expectations
            <h>Preamble
            <p>The intent of this statement is to enumerate and clarify the 
            expectations that test takers may reasonably have about the testing 
            process, and the expectations that those who develop, administer, 
            and use tests may have of test takers.
            <p>Tests are defined broadly here as psychological and educational 
            instruments developed and used by testing professionals in 
            organizations such as schools, industries, clinical practice, 
            counseling settings and human service and other agencies, including 
            those assessment procedures and devices that are used for making 
            inferences about people in the above-named settings.
            <p>The purpose of the statement is to inform and to help educate not 
            only test takers, but also others involved in the testing enterprise 
            so that measurements may be most validly and appropriately used. 
            This document is intended as an effort to inspire improvements in 
            the testing process and does not have the force of law. Its 
            orientation is to encourage positive and high quality interactions 
            between testing professionals and test takers.
            <p>The rights and responsibilities listed in this document are neither 
            legally based nor inalienable rights and responsibilities such as 
            those listed in the United States of America's Bill of Rights. 
            Rather, they represent the best judgments of testing professionals 
            about the reasonable expectations that those involved in the testing 
            enterprise (test producers, test users, and test takers) should have 
            of each other.
            <p>Testing professionals include developers of assessment products and 
            services, those who market and sell them, persons who select them, 
            test administrators and scorers, those who interpret test results, 
            and trained users of the information. Persons who engage in each of 
            these activities have significant responsibilities that are 
            described elsewhere, in documents such as those that follow 
            (American Association for Counseling and Development, 1988; American 
            Speech-Language-Hearing Association, 1994; Joint Committee on 
            Testing Practices, 1988; National Association of School 
            Psychologists, 1992; National Council on Measurement in Education, 
            1995).
            <p>In some circumstances, the test developer and the test user may not 
            be the same person, group of persons, or organization. In such 
            situations, the professionals involved in the testing should 
            clarify, for the test taker as well as for themselves, who is 
            responsible for each aspect of the testing process. For example, 
            when an individual chooses to take a college admissions test, at 
            least three parties are involved in addition to the test taker: the 
            test developer and publisher, the individuals who administer the 
            test to the test taker, and the institutions of higher education who 
            will eventually use the information. In such cases a test taker may 
            need to request clarifications about their rights and 
            responsibilities. When test takers are young children (e.g., those 
            taking standardized tests in the schools) or are persons who spend 
            some or all their time in institutions or are incapacitated, parents 
            or guardians may be granted some of the rights and responsibilities, 
            rather than, or in addition to, the individual.
            <p>Perhaps the most fundamental right test takers have is to be able to 
            take tests that meet high professional standards, such as those 
            described in Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing 
            (American Educational Research Association, American Psychological 
            Association, & National Council on Measurement in Education, 1999) 
            as well as those of other appropriate professional associations. 
            This statement should be used as an adjunct, or supplement, to those 
            standards. State and federal laws, of course, supersede any rights 
            and responsibilities that are stated here.

              <p>Be informed of your rights and responsibilities as a test taker.

              <p>Be treated with courtesy, respect, and impartiality, regardless of 
              your age, disability, ethnicity, gender, national origin, 
              religion, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.

              <p>Be tested with measures that meet professional standards and that 
              are appropriate, given the manner in which the test results will 
              be used. 

              <p>Receive a brief oral or written explanation prior to testing about 
              the purpose(s) for testing, the kind(s) of tests to be used, if 
              the results will be reported to you or to others, and the planned 
              use(s) of the results. If you have a disability, you have the 
              right to inquire and receive information about testing 
              accommodations. If you have difficulty in comprehending the 
              language of the test, you have a right to know in advance of 
              testing whether any accommodations may be available to you.

              <p>Know in advance of testing when the test will be administered, if 
              and when test results will be available to you, and if there is a 
              fee for testing services that you are expected to pay.

              <p>Have your test administered and your test results interpreted by 
              appropriately trained individuals who follow professional codes of 
              ethics.

              <p>Know if a test is optional and learn of the consequences of taking 
              or not taking the test, fully completing the test, or canceling 
              the scores. You may need to ask questions to learn these 
              consequences.

              <p>Receive a written or oral explanation of your test results within 
              a reasonable amount of time after testing and in commonly 
              understood terms.

              <p>Have your test results kept confidential to the extent allowed by 
              law.

              <p>Present concerns about the testing process or your results and 
              receive information about procedures that will be used to address 
              such concerns. 
            <h>As a test taker, you have the responsibility to:
              <p>Read and/or listen to your rights and responsibilities as a test 
              taker.

              <p>Treat others with courtesy and respect during the testing process.

              <p>Ask questions prior to testing if you are uncertain about why the 
              test is being given, how it will be given, what you will be asked 
              to do, and what will be done with the results.

              <p>Read or listen to descriptive information in advance of testing 
              and listen carefully to all test instructions. You should inform 
              an examiner in advance of testing if you wish to receive a testing 
              accommodation or if you have a physical condition or illness that 
              may interfere with your performance on the test. If you have 
              difficulty comprehending the language of the test, it is your 
              responsibility to inform an examiner.

              <p>Know when and where the test will be given, pay for the test if 
              required, appear on time with any required materials, and be ready 
              to be tested.

              <p>Follow the test instructions you are given and represent yourself 
              honestly during the testing.

              <p>Be familiar with and accept the consequences of not taking the 
              test, should you choose not to take the test.

              <p>Inform appropriate person(s), as specified to you by the 
              organization responsible for testing, if you believe that testing 
              conditions affected your results.

              <p>Ask about the confidentiality of your test results, if this aspect 
              concerns you.

              <p>Present concerns about the testing process or results in a timely, 
              respectful way, if you have any.

            <h>The Rights of Test Takers:
            Guidelines for Testing Professionals
            <p>Test takers have the rights described below. It is the 
            responsibility of the professionals involved in the testing process 
            to ensure that test takers receive these rights.
              <p>Because test takers have the right to be informed of their rights 
              and responsibilities as test takers, it is normally the 
              responsibility of the individual who administers a test (or the 
              organization that prepared the test) to inform test takers of 
              these rights and responsibilities.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to be treated with courtesy, 
              respect, and impartiality, regardless of their age, disability, 
              ethnicity, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual 
              orientation, or other personal characteristics, testing 
              professionals should:

                <p>Make test takers aware of any materials that are available to 
                assist them in test preparation. These  materials should be 
                clearly described in test registration and/or test 
                familiarization materials.

                <p>See that test takers are provided with reasonable access to 
                testing services.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to be tested with measures that 
              meet professional standards that are appropriate for the test use 
              and the test taker, given the manner in which the results will be 
              used, testing professionals should:

                <p>Take steps to utilize measures that meet professional standards 
                and are reliable, relevant, useful given the intended purpose 
                and are fair for test takers from varying societal groups.

                <p>Advise test takers that they are entitled to request reasonable 
                accommodations in test administration that are likely to 
                increase the validity of their test scores if they have a 
                disability recognized under the Americans with Disabilities Act 
                or other relevant legislation.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to be informed, prior to 
              testing, about the test's purposes, the nature of the test, 
              whether test results will be reported to the test takers, and the 
              planned use of the results (when not in conflict with the testing 
              purposes), testing professionals should:

                <p>Give or provide test takers with access to a brief description 
                about the test purpose (e.g., diagnosis, placement, selection, 
                etc.) and the kind(s) of tests and formats that will be used 
                (e.g., individual/group, multiple-choice/free 
                response/performance, timed/untimed, etc.), unless such 
                information might be detrimental to the objectives of the test.

                <p>Tell test takers, prior to testing, about the planned use(s) of 
                the test results. Upon request, the test taker should be given 
                information about how long such test scores are typically kept 
                on file and remain available.

                <p>Provide test takers, if requested, with information about any 
                preventative measures that have been instituted to safeguard the 
                accuracy of test scores. Such information would include any 
                quality control procedures that are employed and some of the 
                steps taken to prevent dishonesty in test performance.

                <p>Inform test takers, in advance of the testing, about required 
                materials that must be brought to the test site (e.g., pencil, 
                paper) and about any rules that allow or prohibit use of other 
                materials (e.g., calculators).

                <p>Provide test takers, upon request, with general information 
                about the appropriateness of the test for its intended purpose, 
                to the extent that such information does not involve the release 
                of proprietary information. (For example, the test taker might 
                be told, "Scores on this test are useful in predicting how 
                successful people will be in this kind of work" or "Scores on 
                this test, along with other information, help us to determine if 
                students are likely to benefit from this program.")

                <p>Provide test takers, upon request, with information about 
                re-testing, including if it is possible to re-take the test or 
                another version of it, and if so, how often, how soon, and under 
                what conditions.

                <p>Provide test takers, upon request, with information about how 
                the test will be scored and in what detail. On multiple-choice 
                tests, this information might include suggestions for test 
                taking and about the use of a correction for guessing. On tests 
                scored using professional judgment (e.g., essay tests or 
                projective techniques), a general description of the scoring 
                procedures might be provided except when such information is 
                proprietary or would tend to influence test performance 
                inappropriately.

                <p>Inform test takers about the type of feedback and interpretation 
                that is routinely provided, as well as what is available for a 
                fee. Test takers have the right to request and receive 
                information regarding whether or not they can obtain copies of 
                their test answer sheets or their test materials, if they can 
                have their scores verified, and if they may cancel their test 
                results.

                <p>Provide test takers, prior to testing, either in the written 
                instructions, in other written documents or orally, with answers 
                to questions that test takers may have about basic test 
                administration procedures.

                <p>Inform test takers, prior to testing, if questions from test 
                takers will not be permitted during the testing process.

                <p>Provide test takers with information about the use of computers, 
                calculators, or other equipment, if any, used in the testing and 
                give them an opportunity to practice using such equipment, 
                unless its unpracticed use is part of the test purpose, or 
                practice would compromise the validity of the results, and to 
                provide a testing accommodation for the use of such equipment, 
                if needed.

                <p>Inform test takers that, if they have a disability, they have 
                the right to request and receive accommodations or modifications 
                in accordance with the provisions of the Americans with 
                Disabilities Act and other relevant legislation.

                <p>Provide test takers with information that will be of use in 
                making decisions if test takers have options regarding which 
                tests, test forms or test formats to take.

              <p>Because that test takers have a right to be informed in advance 
              when the test will be administered, if and when test results will 
              be available, and if there is a fee for testing services that the 
              test takers are expected to pay, test professionals should: 

                <p>Notify test takers of the alteration in a timely manner if a 
                previously announced testing schedule changes, provide a 
                reasonable explanation for the change, and inform test takers of 
                the new schedule. If there is a change, reasonable alternatives 
                to the original schedule should be provided.

                <p>Inform test takers prior to testing about any anticipated fee 
                for the testing process, as well as the fees associated with 
                each component of the process, if the components can be 
                separated.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to have their tests 
              administered and interpreted by appropriately trained individuals, 
              testing professionals should:

                <p>Know how to select the appropriate test for the intended 
                purposes.

                <p>When testing persons with documented disabilities and other 
                special characteristics that require special testing conditions 
                and/or interpretation of results, have the skills and knowledge 
                for such testing and interpretation.

                <p>Provide reasonable information regarding their qualifications, 
                upon request.

                <p>Insure that test conditions, especially if unusual, do not 
                unduly interfere with test performance. Test conditions will 
                normally be similar to those used to standardize the test.

                <p>Provide candidates with a reasonable amount of time to complete 
                the test, unless a test has a time limit.

                <p>Take reasonable actions to safeguard against fraudulent actions 
                (e.g., cheating) that could place honest test takers at a 
                disadvantage.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to be informed about why they 
              are being asked to take particular tests, if a test is optional, 
              and what the consequences are should they choose not to complete 
              the test, testing professionals should: 

                <p>Normally only engage in testing activities with test takers 
                after the test takers have provided their informed consent to 
                take a test, except when testing without consent has been 
                mandated by law or governmental regulation, or when consent is 
                implied by an action the test takers have already taken (e.g., 
                such as when applying for employment and a personnel examination 
                is mandated).

                <p>Explain to test takers why they should consider taking voluntary 
                tests.

                <p>Explain, if a test taker refuses to take or complete a voluntary 
                test, either orally or in writing, what the negative 
                consequences may be to them for their decision to do so.

                <p>Promptly inform the test taker if a testing professional decides 
                that there is a need to deviate from the testing services to 
                which the test taker initially agreed (e.g., should the testing 
                professional believe it would be wise to administer an 
                additional test or an alternative test), and provide an 
                explanation for the change.

              <p>Because test takers have a right to receive a written or oral 
              explanation of their test results within a reasonable amount of 
              time after testing and in commonly understood terms, testing 
              professionals should: 

                <p>Interpret test results in light of one or more additional 
                considerations (e.g., disability, language proficiency), if 
                those considerations are relevant to the purposes of the test 
                and performance on the test, and are in accordance with current 
                laws.

                <p>Provide, upon request, information to test takers about the 
                sources used in interpreting their test results, including 
                technical manuals, technical reports, norms, and a description 
                of the comparison group, or additional information about the 
                test taker(s).

                <p>Provide, upon request, recommendations to test takers about how 
                they could improve their performance on the test, should they 
                choose or be required to take the test again.

                <p>Provide, upon request, information to test takers about their 
                options for obtaining a second interpretation of their results. 
                Test takers may select an appropriately trained professional to 
                provide this second opinion.

                <p>Provide test takers with the criteria used to determine a 
                passing score, when individual test scores are reported and 
                related to a pass-fail standard.

                <p>Inform test takers, upon request, how much their scores might 
                change, should they elect to take the test again. Such 
                information would include variation in test performance due to 
                measurement error (e.g., the appropriate standard errors of 
                measurement) and changes in performance over time with or 
                without intervention (e.g., additional training or treatment).

                <p>Communicate test results to test takers in an appropriate and 
                sensitive manner, without use of negative labels or comments 
                likely to inflame or stigmatize the test taker.

                <p>Provide corrected test scores to test takers as rapidly as 
                possible, should an error occur in the processing or reporting 
                of scores. The length of time is often dictated by individuals 
                responsible for processing or reporting the scores, rather than 
                the individuals responsible for testing, should the two parties 
                indeed differ.

                <p>Correct any errors as rapidly as possible if there are errors in 
                the process of developing scores.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to have the results of tests 
              kept confidential to the extent allowed by law, testing 
              professionals should: 

                <p>Insure that records of test results (in paper or electronic 
                form) are safeguarded and maintained so that only individuals 
                who have a legitimate right to access them will be able to do 
                so. 

                <p>Should provide test takers, upon request, with information 
                regarding who has a legitimate right to access their test 
                results (when individually identified) and in what form. Testing 
                professionals should respond appropriately to questions 
                regarding the reasons why such individuals may have access to 
                test results and how they may use the results. 

                <p>Advise test takers that they are entitled to limit access to 
                their results (when individually identified) to those persons or 
                institutions, and for those purposes, revealed to them prior to 
                testing. Exceptions may occur when test takers, or their 
                guardians, consent to release the test results to others or when 
                testing professionals are authorized by law to release test 
                results. 

                <p>Keep confidential any requests for testing accommodations and 
                the documentation supporting the request.

              <p>Because test takers have the right to present concerns about the 
              testing process and to receive information about procedures that 
              will be used to address such concerns, testing professionals 
              should: 

                <p>Inform test takers how they can question the results of the 
                testing if they do not believe that the test was administered 
                properly or scored correctly, or other such concerns. 

                <p>Inform test takers of the procedures for appealing decisions 
                that they believe are based in whole or in part on erroneous 
                test results. 
                Inform test takers, if their test results are under 
                investigation and may be canceled, invalidated, or not released 
                for normal use. In such an event, that investigation should be 
                performed in a timely manner. The investigation should use all 
                available information that addresses the reason(s) for the 
                investigation, and the test taker should also be informed of the 
                information that he/she may need to provide to assist with the 
                investigation. 

                <p>Inform the test taker, if that test taker's test results are 
                canceled or not released for normal use, why that action was 
                taken. The test taker is entitled to request and receive 
                information on the types of evidence and procedures that have 
                been used to make that determination. 
            <h>The Responsibilities of Test Takers:
            Guidelines for Testing Professionals
            <p>Testing Professionals should take steps to ensure that test takers 
            know that they have specific responsibilities in addition to their 
            rights described above.
              <p>Testing professionals need to inform test takers that they should 
              listen to and/or read their rights and responsibilities as a test 
              taker and ask questions about issues they do not understand.

              <p>Testing professionals should take steps, as appropriate, to ensure 
              that test takers know that they:

                <p>Are responsible for their behavior throughout the entire testing 
                process.
                Should not interfere with the rights of others involved in the 
                testing process. 

                <p>Should not compromise the integrity of the test and its 
                interpretation in any manner.

              <p>Testing professionals should remind test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to ask questions prior to testing if they are 
              uncertain about why the test is being given, how it will be given, 
              what they will be asked to do, and what will be done with the 
              results. Testing professionals should: 

                <p>Advise test takers that it is their responsibility to review 
                materials supplied by test publishers and others as part of the 
                testing process and to ask questions about areas that they feel 
                they should understand better prior to the start of testing.

                <p>Inform test takers that it is their responsibility to request 
                more information if they are not satisfied with what they know 
                about how their test results will be used and what will be done 
                with them.

              <p>Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to read descriptive material they receive in 
              advance of a test and to listen carefully to test instructions. 
              Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to inform an examiner in advance of testing if they 
              wish to receive a testing accommodation or if they have a physical 
              condition or illness that may interfere with their performance. 
              Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to inform an examiner if they have difficulty 
              comprehending the language in which the test is given. Testing 
              professionals should: 

                <p>Inform test takers that, if they need special testing 
                arrangements, it is their responsibility to request appropriate 
                accommodations and to provide any requested documentation as far 
                in advance of the testing date as possible. Testing 
                professionals should inform test takers about the documentation 
                needed to receive a requested testing accommodation.

                <p>Inform test takers that, if they request but do not receive a 
                testing accommodation, they could request information about why 
                their request was denied.

              <p>Testing professionals should inform test takers when and where the 
              test will be given, and whether payment for the testing is 
              required. Having been so informed, it is the responsibility of the 
              test taker to appear on time with any required materials, pay for 
              testing services and be ready to be tested. Testing professionals 
              should:  

                <p>Inform test takers that they are responsible for familiarizing 
                themselves with the appropriate materials needed for testing and 
                for requesting information about these materials, if needed. 

                <p>Inform the test taker, if the testing situation requires that 
                test takers bring materials (e.g., personal identification, 
                pencils, calculators, etc.) to the testing site, of this 
                responsibility to do so.

              <p>Testing professionals should advise test takers, prior to testing, 
              that it is their responsibility to:

                <l>Listen to and/or read the directions given to them. 

                <l>Follow instructions given by testing professionals. 
                Complete the test as directed. 

                <l>Perform to the best of their ability if they want their score to 
                be a reflection of their best effort. 

                <l>Behave honestly (e.g., not cheating or assisting others who 
                cheat).

              <p>Testing professionals should inform test takers about the 
              consequences of not taking a test, should they choose not to take 
              the test. Once so informed, it is the responsibility of the test 
              taker to accept such consequences, and the testing professional 
              should so inform the test takers. If test takers have questions 
              regarding these consequences, it is their responsibility to ask 
              questions of the testing professional, and the testing 
              professional should so inform the test takers.

              <p>Testing professionals should inform test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to notify appropriate persons, as specified by the 
              testing organization, if they do not understand their results, or 
              if they believe that testing conditions affected the results. 
              Testing professionals should: 

                <p>Provide information to test takers, upon request, about 
                appropriate procedures for questioning or canceling their test 
                scores or results, if relevant to the purposes of testing. 

                <p>Provide to test takers, upon request, the procedures for 
                reviewing, re-testing, or canceling their scores or test 
                results, if they believe that testing conditions affected their 
                results and if relevant to the purposes of testing. 

                <p>Provide documentation to the test taker about known testing 
                conditions that might have affected the results of the testing, 
                if relevant to the purposes of testing.

              <p>Testing professionals should advise test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to ask questions about the confidentiality of their 
              test results, if this aspect concerns them.

              <p>Testing professionals should advise test takers that it is their 
              responsibility to present concerns about the testing process in a 
              timely, respectful manner.
