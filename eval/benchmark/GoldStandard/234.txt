                        real estate market conditions. Our home and commercial 
                        real estate appraisers have both the knowledge and 
                        expertise to help clients estimate home values or the 
                        value of their residential income property or commercial 
                        property. We know residential and commercial property 
                        values because we have performed home appraisal and 
                        commercial appraisals in Southern California for over 30 
                        years. 
                        <p>When choosing a california appraiser you want to select 
                        the best qualified residential or commercial appraisers 
                        to meet your appraisal needs. In order to determine the 
                        best qualified commercial appraiser the first step is to 
                        review the commercial appraisers qualifications.  
                        Generally, each highly qualified California commercial 
                        appraiser will list his or her appraisal qualifications 
                        on their web site. If you do not find a resume then you 
                        should move on to another web site that provides the 
                        appraiser qualifications. After you have located the 
                        qualifications you then proceed to look down the resume. 
                         What your looking for is specialized commercial 
                        appraisal education and experience. First your looking 
                        for any college degree's specializing in commercial real 
                        estate or real estate finance. Then you would look for 
                        individual commercial appraisal classes in the type of 
                        property you need to have appraised. Next you want to 
                        look to see if they maintain membership in professional 
                        California appraisal or commercial real estate 
                        organizations such as the Appraisal Institute, American 
                        Society of Appraisers, Certified Commercial Investment 
                        Member CCIM, that require the home or commercial 
                        appraiser to demonstrate at lease 100 hours of 
                        continuing education every 5 years and maintain 
                        appraisal skills and high ethical standards. After that, 
                        you should look for California appraisal experience in 
                        the type of property or properties you need to have 
                        appraised such as a home, apartment, industrial 
                        building, shopping center, office building, vacant land, 
                        custom home, and overall general commercial appraisal 
                        experience. 
                        <p>A home appraisal by a certified California real estate 
                        appraisers can help determine if PMI Private Mortgage 
                        Insurance can be removed. With an appraisal report 
                        signed by a certified California appraiser, the mortgage 
                        company will most often remove PMI private mortgage 
                        insurance with little trouble. Hiring a California 
                        appraiser to find out if your property qualifies is the 
                        first step in removing PMI. Just email your property 
                        address to us and our home appraiser provide your with a 
                        formula to calculate if you qualify for removal of PMI. 
                        in any event, having a home appraisal one of the first 
                        steps in removing PMI.

                        County, and San Bernardino County.

                        <p>Residential and commercial review appraisal services. 
                        Our firm provides highly experienced geographically 
                        located residential and commercial review appraisers 
                        throughout California for technical compliance with the 
                        Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice 
                        (USPAP). Many technical appraisal issues confront banks 
                        and lenders today and require the skill of a highly 
                        experienced residential or commercial review appraiser. 
                        For example, if zoning issues are not properly addressed 
                        in an appraisal, it can affect the outcome of the 
                        highest and best use of the subject property and 
                        therefore the selection of the comparable sales. As a 
                        result, if the comparable sales utilized in the report 
                        do not have a similar highest and best use, the opinion 
                        of market value of the subject property may not be 
                        credible.  

                        <p>Defining the appraisal process. The home & commercial 
                        appraisal process starts with the definition of the 
                        problem by California appraisers. One of the first steps 
                        in the residential or commercial appraisal process is 
                        the identification of the client, the intended use and 
                        users, and the purpose of the appraisal. Then the 
                        commercial appraiser would want to know the property 
                        characteristics including its location and property 
                        rights including leased fee, leasehold, or fee simple. 
                        In addition, any extraordinary assumptions and or 
                        hypothetical conditions would further define the 
                        appraisal problem. Many times this will be enough 
                        information to indicate the type of commercial appraisal 
                        report option California appraisers can use. 
                        <p>After the commercial appraisal problem has been defined 
                        the residential or commercial appraiser can then 
                        determine a cursory scope of work and quote a fee. After 
                        the client accepts the fee and the type of report option 
                        the commercial appraisal process can then proceed to the 
                        next step. 
                        <p>In order to describe the scope of work in a home or 
                        commercial appraisal assignment, the California 
                        appraiser must first identify any extraordinary 
                        assumptions and or hypothetical conditions. 
                        Extraordinary assumptions presume uncertain information 
                        to be factual. If found to be false, could alter the 
                        California appraisers opinion of value.  Hypothetical 
                        conditions are contrary to what exists, but the 
                        conditions are asserted by commercial appraisers for 
                        purposes of analysis. 
                        <p>The next step is defining the scope of work. This would 
                        be the amount of work and specific type of information 
                        and data researched and the type of analysis and 
                        methodologies applied in a home or commercial appraisal. 
                        The scope of work should indicate what was done and what 
                        was not done. Following this step the California 
                        appraiser would gather all the data.
