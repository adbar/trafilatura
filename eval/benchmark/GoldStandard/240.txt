<h>CHAPTER I
<h>Korea, Case History of a Pawn
<p>The Soviet-sponsored government of North Korea, having failed to conquer its 
southern neighbor by less violent means, invaded the Republic of Korea on 25 
June 1950. When the United States, with other United Nations, came to the aid of 
the South Koreans, a 3-year war resulted that cost more than 142,000 American 
battle casualties. 
<p>The campaigns set in motion by the invasion of South Korea later were 
characterized as a "limited war." The fighting was deliberately confined in 
geographic terms, political decisions placed restrictions upon military 
strategy, and none of the belligerents, with the exception of the two Korean 
governments, used its full military potential. But there was nothing limited 
about the ferocity of the battles. 
<p>Erupting from the rivalries of great nations, the Korean War was greatly 
influenced by domestic conditions rooted deep in the history of Korea, and by 
the topography of the peninsula where it took place. 
<p>The Land
<p>Korea is a harsh Asian peninsula inhabited by a hardy, harassed people who 
rarely if ever had been completely free. War and tragedy form the main theme of 
Korea's history. Suppression and ill-use have been the heritage of its 
long-suffering people. Few habitable areas of the earth are more unsuited to 
large-scale, modern military operations. The rugged landscape, a lack of 
adequate roads, rail lines, and military harbors, the narrow peninsula, and, not 
least, climatic extremes restrict and hamper maneuver, severely limit logistic 
support, and intensify the normal hardships of war. 
<p>Jutting from the central Asian mainland, the Korean peninsula has an outline 
resembling Florida's. In the north, a river-mountain complex separates Korea 
from Manchuria and the maritime provinces of the USSR. Eastward, across the Sea 
of Japan, the Japanese islands flank the peninsula. To the west, the Yellow Sea 
stands between Korea and China. The Korean peninsula stretches south for more 
than 500 miles, while east and west, it spans only 220 miles at its widest. 
Thousands of islets, some scarcely more than large rocks, rim its 5,400-mile 
coastline. 
<p>Page 2 
<p>In area, Korea equals the combined states of Tennessee and Kentucky, covering 
about 85,000 square miles. The facetious claim that Korea, ironed flat, would 
cover the whole world has an element of truth, for the terrain throughout the 
peninsula is mountainous. Roads and railways wind through tortuous valleys. 
Ice-free ports exist on Korea's southern and western coasts, but the latter 
shore is distinguished by some of the most extreme tidal variations in the 
world. On the eastern shore, there are only a few adequate harbors. Although 
geographers place Korea in a temperate zone, the classification hardly mitigates 
the harsh winters, particularly in the wind-swept northern mountains, or the 
sweltering, dusty, and no less harsh summers in the south. 
<h>Korea's Past
<p>The forces shaping Korea into a nation arose from its unfortunate proximity to 
three powers, China, Japan, and Russia. The periodic surges of ambition in each 
of these neighbors turned Korea into a battleground and a spoil. Sometimes 
described as a "dagger pointed at the heart of Japan," Korea became instead 
Japan's steppingstone to the Asian mainland. For China and, later, Russia, Korea 
was a back gate both to be locked against intruders and to be opened during any 
opportunity for expansion. Korea's ice-free ports fronting the Sea of Japan were 
especially coveted by the Russians. Korea therefore has seldom been completely 
free of domination by one of its stronger neighbors. 
<p>China reached the Korean scene first, making its impact felt on northern Korea 
several centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. By the 7th century, 
A.D., the Chinese had forced their thought, customs, and manners into the Korean 
culture and had turned Korea into a virtual satellite. Late in that century, a 
native dynasty, Chinese-controlled, unified the peninsula. Before then Japan had 
occasionally invaded southern Korea, but with little lasting effect. Badly 
defeated by the Koreans in 663 A.D., Japan retired for nearly a thousand years. 
<p>Like China, Korea endured the Mongol armies in the 13th century. For nearly a 
hundred years the savages from the steppes ruled and ravaged Korea. Kublai Khan 
launched two abortive invasions of Japan from Korea, ruthlessly squandering 
Korean lives and property in his depredations. With the gradual dissipation of 
Mongol power by the mid-14th century, Korea again basked in the reflected glory 
of a revitalized China. Adapting Chinese culture to their own talents, the 
Koreans

<p>flourished. Skilled artisans, craftsmen, and inventors, as well as philosophers 
and scholars, brought Korea a level of civilization rivaling that of China. But 
the Japanese violently disrupted this happy era. In a brutal expedition 
beginning in 1592, Japanese samurai under the brilliant Hideyoshi pillaged the 
peninsula for seven years. Aided by China, the Koreans eventually expelled the 
Japanese, but their home had become a wasteland. Their best artisans and 
scholars, along with the greater part of their portable treasure, were taken 
home by the Japanese. 
<p>In the following centuries, Korea kept loose cultural and political ties with 
China but withdrew from contact with the rest of the world. It never again 
reached the level of civilization the Japanese had destroyed. When Western 
influence spread to Asia in the 19th century, China's peculiar relationship with 
Korea baffled the West. Western efforts to trade with Korea were thwarted by 
this misunderstanding. The Koreans received Western overtures coldly. They 
impartially murdered French missionaries and American and Dutch seamen. Several 
punitive expeditions by these Western nations against Korea failed to improve 
relations. 
<p>Unfortunately for Korea's privacy, in 1860 Russia reached Korea's borders and 
later in the century westernization again whetted Japan's appetite for 
territorial expansion. With China, Japan, and Russia fighting for control of 
Korea throughout the rest of the 19th century, the Korean people had little 
chance to learn self-government. They remained separate from the modern world 
emerging around them. 
<p>Japan won Korea by defeating China and Russia, in turn, in short but decisive 
wars. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 Japan used Western military techniques 
to beat its larger but tradition-bound enemy. Ten years later, Japan astounded 
the world by defeating Russia. Having occupied Korea to fight Russia, Japan left 
its troops there. Ignoring Korean objections, Japan disbanded the Korean Army 
and abolished the Korean Department of Post and Communications. It allowed a 
semblance of self-rule in Korea for several years, but remained the real master. 
Japanese seizure of governmental functions, the forced abdication of Korea's 
Emperor, and encroachment in all aspects of Korean society culminated in an 
agreement in July 1907 placing Korea completely under Japanese control. The 
annexation of Korea by Japan in August 1910 was simply a formality.  
<h>The United States and Korea
<p>In the quarter century before the Japanese take-over, the United States showed a 
mild interest in Korea and made some effort to support Korean independence, at 
least in principle. In 1882, an American naval officer, Commodore Robert W. 
Shufeldt, negotiated a commercial treaty with the Korean Emperor. The result of 
four years' effort, this treaty was achieved through the reluctant good offices 
of the Chinese 
<p>[2] An account of Korean life under the Japanese can be found in History of the 
Occupation of Korea, August 1945-May 1948, 3 vols. (hereafter cited as History 
of Occupation of Korea), prepared in 1948 by historians of the XXIV Corps, vol. 
I, ch. 2, copy in OCMH.

<p>Government. It provided for exchange of diplomatic representatives, protection 
of navigation and of United States citizens, extraterritoriality, and trade 
under a most-favored nation clause. The treaty could have given the United 
States overriding influence in Korea. But when the Emperor sought an American 
foreign affairs adviser and Army military advisers, the United States moved 
slowly. The matter dragged on for several years. The American representative in 
Korea repeatedly appealed to Washington for action. Although requested in 1884, 
military advisers reached Korea only in 1888. 
<p>The United States treated Korea casually in the late 19th century. Its only 
significance lay in the effect it had upon relationships with other major powers 
in the Far East. According to one authority, "The Korean Government was in the 
position of an incompetent defective not yet committed to guardianship. The 
United States was her only disinterested friend-but had no intention of becoming 
her guardian."  
<p>When the Japanese took over Korea, the United States made no objection. 
President Theodore Roosevelt remarked, "We cannot possibly interfere for the 
Koreans against Japan. ... They could not strike one blow in their own defense." 
On 29 July 1905, Secretary of War William H. Taft negotiated a secret "agreed 
memorandum" with the Japanese Prime Minister. The United States approved Japan's 
"suzerainty over" Korea in return for its pledge not to interfere with American 
interests in the Philippine Islands. The Korean Emperor's appeal to the United 
States for help under the "good offices" clauses of the Shufeldt Treaty fell on 
deaf ears.  
<p>Between 1905 and 1910, uprisings and rebellions erupted frequently throughout 
Korea. Japan crushed them with efficient savagery. The Koreans had few weapons, 
and Japan was a powerful and merciless nation. According to Japanese statistics, 
14,566 Korean "rebels" were killed between July 1907 and December 1908. By 1910, 
when Japan formally annexed Korea, little open resistance remained in the land; 
and no Western nation spoke out against Japan's seizure of the peninsula. 
<p>Complete suppression marked the ensuing thirty-five years of Japanese rule. The 
Japanese exploited the people and the land. But they also modernized Korea, 
building highways, railroads, dams, and factories. Much of this development was 
designed for military use. The port of Pusan, for example, was built for 
military, rather than commercial, reasons; and the rail line running from Pusan 
north to the Manchurian border had much more military than commercial value. 
<p>The Japanese integrated Korean industry into their own economy. Korea became 
completely dependent upon Japan for semi-manufactured commodities, for repair 
parts, and for markets. Many key Korean plants produced only parts used in the 
final assembly of products in Japan. As Japan embarked on its program of 
conquest in Asia in the 1930's, the Japanese turned Korean in

<p>dustry almost exclusively to military use. The heavy, sustained use of machinery 
without adequate maintenance during World War II ruined Korean factories and 
equipment. The use of almost all chemical production, especially of nitrogen, in 
behalf of Japan's war effort caused severe soil depletion in Korea.  
<p>Banning Koreans from responsible positions and from educational opportunities, 
the Japanese controlled key governmental and economic functions. Comprising only 
3 percent of the population of Korea, the 750,000 Japanese residents were 
absolute masters of the country. Nearly 80 percent of the Korean people could 
neither read nor write.  
<p>The Koreans deeply resented Japanese exploitation. Judged in Japanese courts 
under Japanese laws, they received severe sentences for minor offenses, more 
severe than those given Japanese for similar infractions. The 
Japanese-controlled Bank of Chosen charged Koreans interest rates 25 percent 
higher than those assessed Japanese competitors. The Korean national debt 
increased thirty-fold between 1910 and 1945, and the taxation of Koreans was 
oppressive. In most industries, Japanese received twice as much as Koreans doing 
the same work. Large numbers of farms were transferred from Korean to Japanese 
owners.  
<p>Despite iron-handed Japanese rule that sought to crush Korean national 
aspirations, the flame of patriotism and independence remained alive in Korea. 
Revolutionary groups and movements sustained the Korean hope for freedom, 
defying the Japanese whenever possible. One strong group working to free Korea 
from alien rule called itself the "Provisional Government of the Republic of 
Great Korea." It originated on 1 March 1919 when a declaration of independence, 
signed by Korean students, was read before a student gathering in Seoul. The 
Japanese ruthlessly hunted down the instigators of this declaration, and many 
patriots fled Korea to escape torture and death. On 10 April 19l9 some of these 
refugees met in Shanghai and established the Provisional Government. Dr. Syngman 
Rhee headed the group as Premier. After the Manchurian incident in 1931, the 
Provisional Government moved to Nanking and, later, to Chungking. 
<p>This group sought to achieve complete independence for Korea and to establish 
itself as the Korean Government. Differences on how these goals should be 
reached brought frequent clashes in the leadership of the Korean Provisional 
Government. Two men, Rhee and Kim Koo, emerged at the top. When Kim Koo became 
Premier in the mid-1930's, Rhee served as unofficial representative of the 
Provisional Government in the United States. The group acquired a considerable 
following among Koreans in the United States and China and attracted widespread 
passive support within Korea. Both Rhee and Kim were revered by the Korean 
people.

<p>sprang up in Korea. Organized in 1925, it pushed the underground movement 
against Japan. Communist power in Korea grew under the well-organized leadership 
of the anti-Japanese underground. The Korean Communists were in contact with the 
Russian Communists through the Far Eastern Division of the Comintern. It is 
believed, however, that, owing to a secret agreement with Japan, the Russians 
abstained from encouraging too greatly the Communists in Korea during Japanese 
occupation. Many Communist Koreans took refuge in Manchuria, China, and Russia. 
 
<p>In this setting of turbulent and long-suppressed patriotic emotions, it was 
inevitable that the political void caused by the fall of the Japanese Empire at 
the end of World War II should touch off a struggle for power. 
<h>Korea 1945
<p>When World War II began, Korea was regarded by the Allies as a victim 
<p>of, not a party to, Japanese aggression. One of the earliest signs that the 
Allied Powers were concerned about Korea appeared in a Joint statement by the 
United States, China, and Great Britain in December 1943, after the Cairo 
Conference, which said: "The aforesaid three great powers, mindful of the 
enslavement of the people of Korea, are determined that in due course Korea 
shall become free and independent."  
<p>Divergencies between American and Russian policies appearing in the latter 
stages of World War II affected Korea. The destruction of the Axis in 1945 left

<p>power vacuums in many areas of the world and brought the differences between the 
United States and the Soviet Union into sharp focus. Countries newly freed from 
German or Japanese domination assumed significance as possible targets of 
clashing American-Soviet interests. 
<p>Unlike the Soviet Union, the United States attached little importance to Korea 
as a strategic area. Korea supported a relatively small population, and had 
neither important industrial facilities nor many natural resources. If at some 
future date Korea fell into hands unfriendly to the United States, the United 
States recognized that the occupation of Japan might be hampered and American 
freedom of movement might be restricted in the general area. But with China in 
1945 under control of a friendly government, such a situation appeared unlikely. 
Russia, on the other hand, maintained its traditional regard for Korea as a 
strategic area. As later events demonstrated, the Soviet Union would not 
countenance control of Korea by another power and sought to control Korea 
itself. 
<p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Premier Josef V. Stalin at the Yalta 
Conference in 1945 touched upon Korea's future. Roosevelt advocated a 
trusteeship for Korea administered by the United States, the Soviet Union, and 
China. Looking at American experience in the Philippines, he surmised that such 
a trusteeship might last for twenty or thirty years. Stalin said he believed 
that Great Britain should also be a trustee. No actual mention of Korea was made 
in the document recording the agreements at Yalta. The secret protocol developed 
by Roosevelt and Stalin and agreed to by Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill 
only provided territorial and other concessions to the USSR in the Far East as 
conditions for Russian entrance into the war against Japan after the defeat of 
Germany. Later, soon after Roosevelt's death, Stalin told Harry Hopkins, 
President Harry S. Truman's representative in Moscow, that Russia was committed 
to the policy of a 4-power trusteeship for Korea.  
<p>Though American military planners ostensibly paid little attention to Korea, 
they had Korea in mind. On 25 July 1945, the Army Chief of Staff, General of the 
Army George C. Marshall, sent a note to President Truman at Potsdam, advising 
him that some guidance on handling Korea would assist the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the United States 
Army Forces, Pacific, had already received instructions to prepare for occupying 
Japan, and shortly before Potsdam these orders were broadened to include Korea. 
In response to the additional directive, General MacArthur suggested that Tokyo 
and Seoul have first priority for occupation, Pusan second priority, and the 
Kunsan area on Korea's west coast, third priority. General Marshall then 
informed the President that MacArthur should be able to land a division at Pusan 
within a short time of the end of the war. The other strategic areas in Korea,

<p>shall added, were Seoul, near the west coast, and Ch'ongjin, in the north on the 
Sea of Japan. Marshall expected that the Russians, if they participated in the 
occupation, would occupy Ch'ongjin and would undoubtedly move into Manchuria and 
perhaps into north China. He considered it desirable, therefore, to establish 
early control over any areas to be held by the United States.  
<p>Korea was only briefly considered at the Potsdam conference. Among the questions 
discussed were the Soviet timetable for entering the war in the Pacific and the 
Allied proclamation demanding Japan's unconditional surrender. Looking ahead to 
the surrender of the Japanese on the Asiatic mainland, the Allied military 
representatives drew a tentative line across the map of Manchuria, above which 
the Soviet Union was to accept surrender of Japanese forces. No mention was at 
first made of Korea. But since thousands of Japanese troops were stationed in 
Korea, there was a later discussion of Allied operations in that area.  
<p>At Potsdam, the chief of the Russian General Staff told General Marshall that 
Russia would attack Korea after declaring war on Japan. He asked whether the 
Americans could operate against Korean shores in co-ordination with this 
offensive. General Marshall told him that the United States planned no 
amphibious operation against Korea until Japan had been brought under control 
and Japanese strength in South Korea was destroyed. Although the Chiefs of Staff 
developed ideas concerning the partition of Korea, Manchuria, and the Sea of 
Japan into U.S. and USSR zones, these had no connection with the later decisions 
that partitioned Korea into northern and southern areas.  
<p>Russian entry into the war against Japan on 9 August, and signs of imminent 
Japanese collapse on 10 August 1945 changed U.S. Army planning from defeating 
Japan to accepting its surrender. Military planners in the War Department 
Operations Division began to outline surrender procedures in General Order No. 
1, which General MacArthur would transmit to the Japanese Government after its 
surrender. The first paragraph of the order specified the nations and commands 
that were to accept the surrender of Japanese forces throughout the Far East. 
 
<p>The Policy Section of the Strategy and Policy Group in the Operations Division 
drafted the initial version of the order.

that the division of Korea had been agreed upon at the high-level conference of 
the Big Three. In June 1946, the Institute of Pacific Relations published a 
categorical statement that this agreement had been made at Yalta. The New York 
Times in October 1946 named Potsdam as the place where the agreement had been 
made.

<p>Page 9 
<p>Under pressure to produce a paper as quickly as possible, members of the Policy 
Section began work late at night on 10 August. They discussed possible surrender 
zones, the allocation of American, British, Chinese, and Russian occupation 
troops to accept the surrender in the zone most convenient to them, the means of 
actually taking the surrender of the widely scattered Japanese military forces, 
and the position of Russia in the Far East. They quickly decided to include both 
provisions for splitting up the entire Far East for the surrender and 
definitions of the geographical limits of those zones.  
T<p>he Chief of the Policy Section, Col. Charles H. Bonesteel, had thirty minutes 
in which to dictate Paragraph 1 to a secretary, for the Joint Staff Planners and 
the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee were impatiently awaiting the result 
of his work. Colonel Bonesteel thus somewhat hastily decided who would accept 
the Japanese surrender. His thoughts, with very slight revision, were 
incorporated into the final directive.  
<p>Bonesteel's prime consideration was to establish a surrender line as far north 
as he thought the Soviets would accept. He knew that Russian troops could reach 
the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He knew also that 
the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The 
nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem 
therefore was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the 
Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they 
refused to confine their advance to North Korea, the United States would be 
unable to stop them. 
<p>At first Bonesteel had thought of surrender zones conforming to the provincial 
boundary lines. But the only map he had in his office was hardly adequate for 
this sort of distinction. The 38th Parallel, he noted, cut Korea approximately 
through the middle. If this line was agreeable to President Truman and to 
Generalissimo Stalin, it would place Seoul and a nearby prisoner of war camp in 
American hands. It would also leave enough land to be apportioned to the Chinese 
and British if some sort of quadripartite administration became necessary. Thus 
he decided to use the 38th Parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones 
within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and 
Russian authorities. 
<p>The determination of the surrender zones for the Pacific involved other 
countries besides Korea. Since the job had to be done in a hurry, Colonel 
Bonesteel had the paragraphs of the general order rushed through the Chief of 
the Strategy and Policy Group, Brig. Gen. George A. Lincoln, to the Joint Staff 
Planners who were meeting in an all-night session. This channel was the same as 
for all important military policy papers in 1945. Drafts were routed in turn 
through General Lincoln, the Joint Planners, the State-War-Navy Coordinating 
Committee, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretaries of State, War, and 
Navy, until they finally reached the President.

Korean Conflict, pp. 40-53. 
<p>Page 10 
<p>When Bonesteel's draft paper reached the Joint Planners in the pre-dawn hours of 
11 August, Admiral M. B. Gardner suggested moving the surrender line north to 
the 39th Parallel, a recommendation that the planners believed the Navy 
Secretary, James C. Forrestal, favored. Gardner pointed out that the 39th 
Parallel would place Dairen in the military zone to be occupied by the 
Americans. General Lincoln, however, felt that the Russians would hardly accept 
a surrender line that barred them from Dairen and other parts of the Liaotung 
Peninsula; besides, American units would have great difficulty reaching the 
Manchurian port ahead of the Russians. Calling Assistant Secretary of State 
James Dunn, Lincoln ascertained that his opinion was shared. Mr. Dunn believed 
that Korea was more important politically to the United States than Dairen, and 
he felt this to be the view of Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. As a result, 
the 38th Parallel remained in the draft when the Joint Planners handed the 
general order to the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee. 
<p>While General Lincoln was shepherding the document through the State-War-Navy 
Coordinating Committee on 11 and 12 August, the Russians invaded Korea, landing 
on the northeast coast near Rashin. Russian troops then poured out of the 
maritime provinces of Siberia, down the Korean peninsula, and into the 
Kaesong-Ch'unch'on area above Seoul, where they looted much equipment, including 
locomotives and rolling stock. Reports of the Russian troop movements reaching 
Washington underscored the need for concurrence in the proposed general order. 
Otherwise, the Russian advance would render academic the American acceptance of 
the Japanese surrender in southern Korea. At the same time, swift Russian troop 
movements into key areas of southern Manchuria eliminated the possibility of 
including Dairen in the American surrender zone. 
<p>Between 11 and 14 August, the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee and the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff discussed the wording of the surrender instrument. 
Meanwhile, General MacArthur informed the Joint Chiefs of Staff that he would 
adhere to three priorities for the use of the forces under his command. After 
the Japanese surrender, the occupation of Japan would come first, Korea second, 
China third. 
<p>In Washington, the War Department Operations Division rephrased General Order 
No. 1 to the satisfaction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the heads of the 
State, War, and Navy Departments. On 15 August 1945, clean copies of the draft 
order were sent to Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy's White House office. Within a 
few hours President Truman gave his approval, directing at the same time that 
General Order No. 1 be sent also to the capitals of Great Britain and the USSR 
with requests for concurrence by the heads of those states. The Joint Chiefs of 
Staff telegraphed the general order to General MacArthur and directed that he 
furnish an estimated time schedule for the occupation of a port in Korea. 
<p>Among the items it specified, General Order No. 1 stated that Japanese forces 
north of the 38th Parallel in Korea would surrender to the Russian commander, 
while those south of the parallel 
<p>Page 11 
<p>would surrender to the commanding general of the U.S. expeditionary forces. As 
Washington waited for the Moscow reaction to President Truman's message, there 
was a short period of suspense. Russian troops had entered Korea three days 
before the President accepted the draft of General Order No. 1. If the Russians 
failed to accept the proposal, and if Russian troops occupied Seoul, General 
Lincoln suggested that American occupation forces move into Pusan. 
<p>Stalin replied to President Truman on 16 August 1945. He said nothing 
specifically about the 38th Parallel but offered no objection to the substance 
of the President's message. He asked that the general order be "corrected" to 
authorize Russian forces to accept the surrender of the Japanese in the northern 
half of Hokkaido. Stalin also reminded the President that the Liaotung 
Peninsula, upon which Dairen and Port Arthur are located, was part of Manchuria 
and thus within the USSR military zone. Though President Truman parried Stalin's 
proposal to place Russian forces on Hokkaido, Stalin's message settled the 
surrender zones in Korea and canceled American plans to land troops at Dairen. 
<h>The New Zones
<p>The new dividing line, about 190 miles across the peninsula, sliced across Korea 
without regard for political boundaries, geographical features, waterways, or 
paths of commerce. The 38th Parallel cut more than 75 streams and 12 rivers, 
intersected many high ridges at variant angles, severed 181 small cart roads, 
104 country roads, 15 provincial all-weather roads, 8 better-class highways, and 
6 north-south rail lines.  It was, in fact, an arbitrary separation. 
<p>South of the 38th Parallel, the American zone covered 37,000 square miles and 
held an estimated 21,000,000 persons. North of the line of latitude, the USSR 
zone totaled 48,000 square miles and had about 9,000,000 people.  Of the 20 
principal Korean cities, 12 lay within the American zone, including Seoul, the 
largest, with a population of nearly 2,000,000. The American zone included 6 of 
Korea's 13 provinces in their entirety, the major part of 2 more, and a small 
part of another. The two areas, North and South Korea, complemented each other 
both agriculturally and industrially. South Korea was mainly a farming area, 
where fully two-thirds of the inhabitants worked the land. It possessed three 
times as much irrigated rice land as the northern area, and furnished food for 
the north. But North Korea furnished the fertilizer for the southern rice 
fields, and the largest nitrogenous fertilizer plant in the Far East was in 
Hungnam. Although North Korea also had a high level of agricultural production, 
it was deficient in some crops. The barrier imposed serious adverse effects on 
both zones.

<p>South Korea had in 1940 turned out about 74 percent of Korea's light consumer 
goods and processed products. Its industry consisted of some large and many 
small plants producing textiles, rubber products, hardware, and ceramics. Many 
of these plants had been built to process raw materials from North Korea. 
<p>North Korea, a largely mountainous region, held valuable mineral deposits, 
especially coal. Excellent hydroelectric plants, constructed during the last ten 
years of Japanese domination, ranked with the largest and best in the world. 
Because of its power resources, North Korea housed almost all of Korea's heavy 
industry, including several rolling mills and a highly developed chemical 
industry. In 1940, North Korea produced 86 percent of Korea's heavy manufactured 
goods. The only petroleum processing plant in the country, a major installation 
designed to serve all of Korea, was located in the north, as were seven of eight 
cement plants. Almost all the electrical power used by South Korea came from the 
north, as did iron, steel, wood pulp, and industrial chemicals needed by South 
Korea's light industry. 
<p>Sharp differences between north and south had traditionally been part of the 
Korean scene. South Koreans considered their northern neighbors crude and 
culturally backward. North Koreans viewed southerners as lazy schemers. During 
the Japanese occupation Koreans in the north had been much less tractable than 
those in the south. Differences in farming accounted for some of the social 
differences in the two zones. A dry-field type of farming in the north opposed a 
rice-culture area in the south to produce marked variations in points of view. 
In the south were more small farms and a high tenancy rate, while in the north 
larger farms and more owner-farmers prevailed. Those differences the 38th 
Parallel promised to exacerbate.
