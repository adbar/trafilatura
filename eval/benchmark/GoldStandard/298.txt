<h>The Age slimes the free market again

<p>Tim Colebatch and Kenneth Davidson must be among the worst of
   Australia's economic commentariat and that's saying something. In To
   reform or not to reform?(The Age, 7 December 2004) he once again
   attacked economic reform, accusing if of just about every economic
   ailment you can imagine. (As usual, our self-appointed free market
   warriors gave him another pass).

<p>When I look back on this man's economic scribblings I'm still appalled
   at the sheer gall of the man and the scale of his anti-market bigotry.
   As I see it, Colebatch is a nauseating example of that growing
   journalistic species that feels free to treat its readers and the
   truth with complete contempt.

<p>Let us, for example take his We're all the losers in the propaganda
   war (The Age, 29 June 1999). This article was a graphic example of
   what I mean. He falsely accused free marketeers are of refusing to
   "admit any negative consequences" from their reforms. And what were
   these "negative consequences"? Labour-market reforms that raise
   productivity have "no impact on unemployment" (sic) and lower tariffs
   do nothing for employment and the trade balance.

<p>This nonsense was followed by a class warfare argument that though
   productivity is rising and profits as a share of GDP are higher than
   in the 1960s real wages have only risen by 10 per cent in five years.
   This was clearly intended to suggest that the rich must have been
   creaming off the money that should have gon to the workers, which
   brought us to the haves and have-nots, especially the ones on the
   dole.

<p>To ram home the point about how bad we really were doing economically
   he compared the then level of 7.5 per cent unemployment with 1.7 per
   cent that prevailed in 1969. This comparison was meant to insinuate
   that market reforms are really responsible for our unemployment and
   hence the plight of the unemployed.

<p>Taking another stab at free-market thinking, he argued that it was
   responsible our growing foreign debt and our expanding current account
   deficit. Why? Because before 1980 our trade balance was in surplus but
   after liberalisation it went into deficit. Ergo! Those dreaded
   free-market reforms must be the culprit.

<p>Colebatch's primitive economic thinking is based on the old post hoc
   ergo propter hoc fallacy. In plain English, arguing from false causes.
   It assumes what follows an event must have been caused by it. It's a
   common fallacy, particularly among economic illiterates. But
   Colebatch, as economics editor of The Age, is supposed to know better.

<p>I'm inclined to the view that if he really did know better he'd by
   fired as summarily as the conservative Tony McAdams was. The last
   thing The Age seems to want is an open and honest debate about free
   market economics.

<p>Let's take Colebatch's anti-market charges one at a time. First, our
   high level of persistent unemployment was been caused by overpricing
   labour, regardless of what Colebatch says. For this we can thank the
   malevolent influence of our trade unions.

<p>How many families this destructive wage destroyed we'll never know,
   just as we'll never know how many men were driven to suicide by acute
   depression brought on by unemployment, or how many kids ended up
   homeless and drug addicted because of the kind of job-destroying
   wage-fixing policies that Colebatch smugly endorses from his
   air-conditioned office.

<p>That the cost of persistent widespread unemployment is terrible in
   human terms is as indisputable as Colebatch's refusal to debate the
   real cause of the tragedy, despite being challenged to do so. All he
   has to demonstrate is that raising the cost of labour above the value
   of its product does not cause unemployment. Instead he served his
   readers up nonsense about job-destroying productivity gains.

<p>It has not escaped the attention of some that the likes of Colebatch
   have now ceased abusing America's much freer labour markets. For years
   this crowd preached that American conditions created masses of
   low-paid jobs (they prefer no jobs to low-paid ones) and lowered
   productivity and living standards.

<p>But as soon as US productivity started rising, along with real wages,
   and unemployment feell they quietly dropped the issue. America's
   critics were further confounded by the findings of researchers like W.
   Michael Cox, vice-president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas who,
   for example, not only demonstrated that living standards, measured in
   terms of consumption, had been rising and not falling but that the US
   also led Europe, including Germany, in per capita consumption and that
   real German income was 85 per cent of the US level.

<p>Professor Gregory, who has done what he can to discredit American
   labour markets, was frequently quoted by anti-market journalists. The
   plain facts that these ideologues refused to acknowledge is that real
   American wage rates exceeded, and still do, Australian wage rates and
   that America had also returned to full employment.

<p>The 1997 Economic Report of the President revealed that 70 per cent of
   all jobs generated from 1993 to 1996 paid above average wages. The
   very reverse of what the left-wing journalists led the Australian
   public to believe, thanks to the likes of Professor Gregory, who,
   incidentally, ignored a request by the Australian Bulletin of Labour
   to answer Des Moore's argument that America's labour outcomes are
   superior to Australia's. Another fact that strangely enough still
   eludes Mr Colebatch's journalistic eye.

<p>Colebatch claimed profits had been at a record high while real wages
   had risen by only 10 per cent in 5 years. The class-war insinuation is
   clear: profits grow at the expense of wages. Really? Then why didn't
   this happened in the less regulated US labour market where the share
   of national income going to labour was much higher than in the period
   preceding the mid 1970s? People need to be informed of five basic
   facts:

<l>What really matters is the net rate of return on capital, not
   aggregates. Using this measurement profitability during the '90s
   remained below the level of the 1960s.

<l>The so-called profit share of GDP is also misleading from another
   angle. For example, the average annual rate of growth from the deep
   recession of 1991-92 to 1996 was only 2.8 per cent. This means
   companies must have been going through a recovery phase. In addition,
   the measure of profits used in the national accounts was misleading.
   One flaw is that it ignored the unincorporated sector.

<p>Another flaw is that it did not discount for inflation. Taking
   inflation in to account we find that the real combined gross operating
   surplus for the incorporated and unincorporated sectors increased by
   only 0.5 per cent a year from the recession to 1996.

<l>The so-called profit share really refers to corporate profits. This
   rose as the share of the unincorporated sector fell. Taking all
   factors into account, combined corporate and unincorporated profits as
   a share of GDP were below the 1960 average.

<l>There are no such things as shares of GDP. Profits, like wages,
   have to be earned. In a free market labour tends to earn the full
   value of its product while 'profits' tend to correspond to the rate of
   interest.

<l>Real wage rates are not a function of profits but are ultimately
   determined by per capita investment.

<p>Colebatch finally turned his attention to the current account deficit,
   blaming it you guessed it on free trade. That there is nothing wrong
   in principle with a current deficit was never even hinted at.
   
<p>For more than a century after the War of Independence the US ran a
   trade deficit. It was this deficit that underpinned the US economic
   growth and helped build its railways. America was also a high tariff
   country.

<p>If low tariffs caused our trade imbalance why did America run such a
   balance for nearly 100 years. Furthermore, the Asian tigers ran huge
   trade imbalances before the monetary crisis of 1997, even though most
   of them had erected tariff walls. But according to Colebatch's
   brilliant economic thinking none of this is possible perhaps he thinks
   it did not even happen.

<p>Colebatch basically accused free marketeers of being liars and
   intellectual cowards. To say this is rich coming from Colebatch would
   be an understatement. For more years than I care to remember Colebatch
   and Davidson have been using The Age as a propaganda platform to wage
   a disinformation campaign against the free market.

<p>Colebatch then had the cheek to call free-market thinking propaganda,
   which he defined as "creating a false impression" and of trying to
   "mislead". A perfect description of his own brand of left-wing
   journalism.

<p>It's more than five years later and he's still at it.
