                <h>HOW TO WIN BEFORE THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION
            ____________________________________________________

   <p>Actually, the title is a little misleading; because you can't always
   win, but if you have good reasons for your appeal this information
   should help you present your case.

   <p>The Board of Equalization was created by the Legislature to give
   citizens an opportunity to contest the Assessor's valuation of their
   property.  However, the Legislature realized that counties get most of
   their revenue from property taxes, and if it was easy to get the
   valuation reduced counties would soon run out of money.  The
   Legislature handled this by saying in effect "Ok, you have the right
   to appeal your valuation but we're going to make it an uphill battle
   for you to win."

   <p>The Legislature accomplished this by saying, "The Assessor's valuation
   is assume to be correct.  In order for the taxpayer to win his appeal
   he must show by Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Reasoning that the
   Assessor has made a mistake."  Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence
   means a quantum of proof which is less than beyond a reasonable doubt,
   but more than a mere preponderance of the evidence.  It is the quantum
   of evidence necessary to convince the trier of fact that the ultimate
   fact in issue is "highly probably."  Most Boards of Equalization take
   this to mean that the taxpayer's evidence must make it pretty obvious
   that the Assessor made a mistake.  The key word in the last sentence
   is the word "evidence".  You must give good evidence to support your
   appeal.

   <p>Let me give you an example.  You and your next door neighbor get a
   letter from the Assessor informing you that the value of each house
   has risen to $75,000.   Both houses are identical and both of you fill
   an appeal before the Board of Equalization.  Your neighbor comes
   before the Board and says, "This assessment is ridiculous; my house
   can't possibly be worth more than $55,000.  I only paid $35,000 for it
   seven years ago.  I plan to live the rest of my life in this house.
   I'm not going to sell it to make a fast buck!"

   <p>When it is your turn to go before the Board, you say, "This assessment
   is ridiculous; my house can't be worth more than $55,000."  Then you
   show the Board that three other houses in the area have been sold in
   the last year.   The house that was identical to yours sold for
   $54,000, another house that is similar to yours sold for $56,000.  The
   last house, which was better than yours, sold for $66,000.  You show
   the Board that no houses in the area have sold for more than $66,000.
   Now this is a pretty simple example by 99 times out of 100 the Board
   of Equalization will rule in the following manner:  you win your
   appeal, but your neighbor's appeal is denied.  The reasoning behind
   these two rulings is this:   your neighbor did not present any
   evidence that supported his contention that the Assessor made a
   mistake, on the other hand you gave some good hard evidence that
   supported your appeal.

   <p>Let me explain about the sort of evidence that Boards of Equalization
   like and don't like to see.  If you tell us that your roof leaks and
   that there is water damage in the house, bring us some pictures that
   show the damage.  Bring an estimate from a contractor showing how must
   it will cost to fix the roof.  If your foundation is cracked and the
   floor is buckled, bring some estimates of the cost to repair
   everything.  Bring us pictures that backup your contentions.  If the
   Assessor says your house is worth $50,000 and you have tried for the
   last year to sell the house for $45,000 and had no offers, bring a
   letter from your Realtor confirming it.  Show us that a house similar
   to yours, sold for a good deal less than the assessed value of your
   house.  The Board of Equalization is delighted to see good hard
   evidence.

   <p>The Board is not impressed with appeals based on emotion.  Don't jump
   up and down about the percent of tax increase.  It doesn't matter what
   the percentage of increase is as long as the marketplace will support
   the value.  Don't tell us that your grandfather bought the property
   for $100 fifty years ago and that you have no intentions of ever
   selling out just to make a buck.  The Board could care less about your
   intentions; the only thing we care about is the present market value.

   <p>The best place to get sales information is the Assessor's office.
   All recorded sales in the county are available there.  It will take
   time and energy but the information is available to you.  The easiest
   way to get another appraisal is to hire a fee appraiser.  The fee
   appraiser can do all the work for you.   The downside to hiring a fee
   appraiser is the cost.  In addition, the fee appraiser's report may or
   may not support your appeal.

   <p>There are three methods for determining the market value of a piece of
   property:  the Direct Sales Comparison method, the Cost Approach to
   Value, and the Income Approach to Value.  While each method has its
   strengths and weaknesses, the direct sales comparison method generally
   carries the most weight.  Almost anyone can use the direct sales
   comparison method; all the information you need can be found in the
   Assessor's office.  If you are going to use the cost approach or the
   income approach it might be wise to take to your accountant and an
   attorney.

   <p>Bring us an argument based only on emotion and outrage and you won't
   have a chance; bring us some good hard persuasive evidence and the
   Board may be able to grant your appeal.
