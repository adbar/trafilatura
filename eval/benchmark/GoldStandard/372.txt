<h>ETHICS OF RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN WORLD HERITAGE AND OTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVE AREAS: POLICY AND PRACTICE

   <h>OPENING ADDRESS FENNER CONFERENCE
   <p>26-28 November 1997
   <p>Senator the Hon Ian Macdonald
   <p>Parliamentary Secretary to the
   <p>Minister for the Environment

   <p>Ethics of Research and Management Practices in World Heritage and
   Other Environmental Sensitive Areas: Policy and Practice. To you Dr
   Mountford and other distinguished scientists, researchers and
   Australians and ladies and gentlemen. It is my pleasure on behalf of
   Senator Robert Hill, the Minister for the Environment, to welcome you
   to Canberra, Becker House, the home of the Australian Academy of
   Science and to this Fenner Conference on the Environment.

   <p>Richard mentioned that about a year ago he suddenly became aware of
   some of the issues or some particular issue that perhaps prompted this
   conference. I also, as a politician from North Queensland with a great
   respect for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Reef
   CRC also became aware of that particular issue in a very political way
   and so it's really a pleasure for me to see the Academy and yourselves
   looking at this particular issue, to come to some conclusions and
   recommendations for Government on how we deal with the matters that
   you are looking at at this Conference: the Ethics of Research and
   Management Practices in World Heritage and Other Environmentally
   Sensitive Areas. It is a theme that is of great importance to
   Australia and to all governments who have responsibilities for
   national parks, world heritage areas and marine parks.

   <p>Australia, as you know, has eleven World Heritage sites, we have over
   800 wetland sites listed under the RAMSAR Convention and a wide range
   of national parks and reserves administered by Local, State, Territory
   and Commonwealth Governments. The management of research in protected
   areas is a critical issue for all levels of government in this
   country. It is an issue that the community is watching with increasing
   interest.

   <p>We need sound information about the environment and the way it reacts
   to the pressure we put on it if we are to be sure that we are doing
   our very best to protect it.

   <p>Now that is a bit like a motherhood statement but as always the
   problem is in the detail. We need to ask ourselves what is appropriate
   and how do we decide when the benefit of manipulative research
   outweighs the environmental costs.

   <p>In some situations the choice can be fairly simple and clear cut. For
   example, we as a government have objected very strongly to the killing
   of whales by the Japanese in the Antarctic for the purpose of
   research. We simply do not believe that it is justifiable.

   <p>Unfortunately, the situation is not always so clear cut.

   <p>The issue which stimulated public activity most recently, and which
   indirectly led to this Conference, which I referred to earlier, is one
   as I said of particular interest for me as a North Queenslander and
   one whose electorate office is in the same city as GBRMPA's head
   office - and will continue to be so I might say despite comments to
   the contrary. And the experiment to which I refer is The Effects of
   Line Fishing experiment which is being conducted by the Reef CRC also
   based in Townsville.

   <p>Fishing is a permitted activity within the Great Barrier Reef World
   Heritage Area. It is therefore vitally important that we know how the
   reef ecosystems react to this pressure if we are going to be able to
   ensure sustainable fishing on the reef and we are going to be able to
   ensure the protection of the environment and jobs.

   <p>The Effects of Line Fishing experiment was designed by a consortium of
   very highly respected and reputable scientists on behalf of the Great
   Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Nevertheless, the proposed
   experiments became the subject of intense national controversy late in
   1996 -- To such an extent that one commentator, what I thought was a
   rather over the top comparison, compared it to or drew a parallel with
   experiments conducted in the concentration camps during World War II.

   <p>But the experiment did raise that sort of public controversy.

   <p>From the political perspective, the controversy led to a situation in
   which the necessary zoning changes to enable the experiment to begin
   were passed by the Senate by only one vote.

   <p>In the heat of the controversy it was surprising to learn that there
   was little guidance from international or Australian literature on the
   ethics of experimental science in protected areas. The controversy
   raised the core issue of the balance between the need to obtain
   scientific information to underpin management and the general
   principle of minimising impacts on protected areas.

<h>Protected Areas:

   <p>In recent decades substantial attention has been paid to the ethics of
   experimental research on humans and on captive animals. But not much
   is done for the natural environment. It is perhaps surprising that the
   broader ethical issues of experimental research in environmentally
   sensitive areas have only recently become matters of urgent attention.

   <p>Your Conference will raise a number of deceptively simple issues. The
   first of these is that of defining protected areas and what is
   reasonably allowable within them.

   <p>The range of protected area categories as determined by the World
   Conservation Union is pretty wide. While all protected areas control
   human occupancy and resource use to some extent, there is substantial
   flexibility in management. The range extends from highly protected
   areas such as strict nature reserves or scientific reference sites
   which are off-limits to human access apart from scientific research
   through to the general use or buffer areas in multiple-use protected
   areas, such as the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

   <p>Multiple-use protected areas provide for sustainable extractive
   activities, harvesting of timber, wildlife or fish and for recreation,
   education and tourism. All these uses are based on the natural values
   of the protected area. Underpinning multiple-use management is a
   recognition of the interdependence of conservation and economic
   activities. This reflects a growing awareness that the challenge is no
   longer deciding whether conservation is a good idea, but how it can
   best be implemented in the national and international interest.

   <p>In multiple-use areas there is usually a gradient between multiple-use
   and strictly protected zones which lies at the heart of the function
   of maintaining essential biological processes, preserving species,
   diversity and genetic variation and providing reference sites.

   <p>It is important that the effects of use can be measured, and as
   necessary mitigated, in order to prevent irreversible damage to
   natural heritage or to the productive capacity of ecosystems.

   <p>Effective management of multiple use therefore requires a sound
   information base. Judgments have to be made on the basis of the best
   available information. A core dilemma is the one which faces this
   Conference - achieving the appropriate balance between supporting
   scientific research specifically for management and a broader need to
   support fundamental research that may not appear to have any immediate
   relevance to management.

<h>Environmental ethics

   <p>The second issue which your Conference raises is that of environmental
   ethics. It is generally accepted that the quality of the air, soil and
   water of the planet has diminished following widespread depletion of
   resources and as a result of pollution, particularly in the areas
   closest to human settlements. The ethical problem is to establish a
   working relationship between the needs of technology - and the economy
   - and nature.

   <p>This dilemma reflects a deeper philosophical division -- Should the
   interests of mankind be the focus of concern or should we recognise
   that the environment has an intrinsic value that we are morally bound
   to protect?

<h>Manipulative research

   <p>The third theme raised by your Conference is that of manipulative
   research.

   <p>Manipulative research is generally understood to be research that
   involves death, pain, or imposed change or disruption on organisms and
   ecosystems. It is considered an integral part of the scientific
   approach to the testing hypotheses. Without the manipulation of
   systems to reduce or control the variables in the natural world, it is
   not possible to discriminate amongst alternative explanations of
   observed patterns.

   <p>This way of doing science in protected areas is not supported by
   everyone -- and some sections of the conservation movement are
   examples of that.

   <p>How then do we resolve these dilemmas? How do we, the decision makers
   responsible for the managing of our valuable protected areas, weigh up
   the pros and cons of research proposals ?

   <p>Environmental ethics is a growing but diffuse field of philosophy. The
   core component is the way in which human kind values and interacts
   with the natural environment. Ethical evaluation requires a set of
   guidelines which can assist researchers and managers in the
   identification and design of research proposals.

   <p>I know that a lot of work has been done over the last year. Following
   The Effects of Line Fishing experiment the Great Barrier Reef Marine
   Park Authority established an Interim Ethics Committee. The committee
   has developed a series of guidelines and procedures which are now used
   to evaluate all research proposals on the Great Barrier Reef. These
   guidelines in turn have contributed to the broader process undertaken
   by the Australian Science Technology and Engineering Commission of
   which I understand more will be said later on in the Conference.

   <p>Ladies and gentlemen, you will have to consider important issues at
   this conference. What are the conditions under which research can be
   justified? What is the responsibility of scientific researchers and
   environmental managers for achieving the most effective design of
   permitted experimentation? What is the relationship between the
   intellectual freedom of the individual researchers and the broader
   concerns of society as a whole?

   <p>These apparently simple questions will lead you into some extremely
   complex and perhaps passionate discussions. I wish you well in those
   discussions here at this conference and in your deliberations. I can
   assure you that the Government anxiously awaits the outcomes of your
   deliberations and those outcomes will be taken on board very seriously
   by the Government. I expect that what you do here will have a
   significance which goes beyond Australia to the broader international
   community concerned with the management of world heritage and other
   environmentally sensitive areas.

   <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, it's a pleasure as I said earlier for me to be
   here today to open this Conference. The work that you do will have a
   great significance and I thank you very much for coming and for
   offering your time, energies and expertise to tackle these very very
   unique problems.

   <p>Thank you for coming and thank you for having me.
