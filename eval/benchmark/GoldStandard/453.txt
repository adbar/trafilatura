                            <h>The Rights of Wrong.

      
  <h>Introduction

   <p>This essay is written in partial reaction to an article written by Sr
   Claire Waddelove OSB ["Laudetur", the Farnborough Abbey review (March
   2001)]. It also draws on the pamphlet "Archbishop Lefebvre and
   Religious Liberty" [M. Davies: The Angelus Press (1980)]. More
   generally, it is an attempt to offer a rationale for the legitimate
   role of conscience and free thought within the Living Apostolic
   Tradition. As in much of my writing, this is an exercise in navigating
   between the twin perils of Conservatism and Liberalism. The
   Conservative, exemplified by Sr Waddelove, would have us believe that
   the only role of conscience is to be conformed to the Official
   Teaching of the Church. The Liberal would have the Official Teaching
   of the Church restricted to a statement along the lines "anything that
   you find congenial is true for you".

     <p>"The essence of Liberalism is that the individual human being has
     the right to decide for himself the norms by which he will regulate
     his life. He has the right to be his own arbiter as to what is
     right and what is wrong. He is under no obligation to subject
     himself to any external authority. In the Liberal sense, liberty of
     conscience is the right of an individual to think and believe
     whatever he wants, even in religion and morality; to express his
     views publicly and persuade others to adopt them by using word of
     mouth, the public press, or any other means."
     [M. Davies (1980)].

   <p>To an extent, the position that Mr Davies sketches out as mistaken is
   actually right and inevitable:

     <p>The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our
     own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive
     others of theirs, or impede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the
     proper guardian of his own health, whether bodily or mental and
     spiritual. Mankind are greater gainers by suffering each other to
     live as seems good to themselves than by compelling each other to
     live as seems good to the rest.
     [John Stewart Mill "On Liberty"]

   <p>This species of freedom is defended by the Church.

     <p>"One who sincerely believes himself to be bound to practice some
     form of non-Catholic religion is in conscience obliged to do
     so...." [Fr Connell: Am. Ecc. Rev. #108, Oct. 1943]

     <p>".... no Catholic .... may hold that the state would be called upon
     to impose the Catholic faith on dissident citizens. Reverence for
     the individual conscience forbids this, and the very nature of
     religion and of the act of faith. If these be not voluntary they
     are nought.
     [Mgr G.W. Shea: The American Ecc. Rev. (1950)]

     <p>"It is a fundamental principle of Catholic theology that no one
     must ever be forced to act against his conscience either in public
     or in private .... (or) be prevented from acting in accordance with
     his conscience in private ...."
     [M. Davies, 1980]

   <p>I suppose that the difference is that the liberal discounts the idea
   that there is an objective right and wrong which he should seek to
   come to a knowledge of. Instead (s)he claims the right to erect or
   construct or engineer as an artisan a personal ethical system or
   "truth". Whereas the objective realist agrees that it is necessary to
   decide what is correct, this is not a right to be striven for but
   rather a duty of which (s)he fears to fail in the discharge. Moreover,
   the objectivist uses the word "decide" in the sense that a scientist
   attempts to decide what is in fact the case rather than the sense in
   which Richard Gere in "American Gigolo" decides which suit and tie to
   wear after his morning work-out.

     <p>"It is true that Christian writers defended religious liberty; thus
     Tertullian said that religion forbids religious compulsion:

     <p>'Non est religionis cogere religionem quae sponte suscipi debet non
     vi.'
     ["Ad Scapulam", near the close]

     <p>and Lactantius, moreover, declared:

     <p>'In order to defend religion man must be willing to die, but not to
     kill.'

     <p>Origen also took up the cause of freedom. Most probably oppression
     and persecution had made men realize that to have one's way of
     thinking, one's conception of the world and of life, dictated to
     him was a mischief-working compulsion. In contrast to the
     smothering violence of the ancient State, and to the power and
     custom of public opinion, the Christians were the defenders of
     freedom, but not of individual subjective freedom, nor of freedom
     of conscience as understood today.
    

   <p>Though the Apostles were sure that they should transmit the deposit of
   the Faith to posterity undefiled, and that any teaching at variance
   with their own, even if proclaimed by an angel of Heaven, would be a
   culpable offense, yet in the case of the heretics Alexander and
   Hymeneus, St Paul deemed that exclusion from the communion of the
   Church was a sufficient penalty [1Tim 1:20; Tit 3:10]. Christians of
   the first three centuries would never have thought to adopt any other
   attitude. Tertullian lays down the rule:

     <p>"Humani iuris et naturalis potestatis, unicuique quod putaverit
     colere, nec alii obest aut prodest alterius religio. Sed nec
     religionis est religionem colere, quae sponte suscipi debeat, non
     vi." [Ad. Scapulam, c. ii]

   <p>In other words, he tells us that the natural law authorized man to
   follow only the voice of individual conscience in the practice of
   religion, since the acceptance of religion was a matter of free will,
   not of compulsion.

   <p>St. Cyprian of Carthage, surrounded as he was by countless schismatics
   and undutiful Christians, also put aside the material sanction of the
   Old Testament, which punished with death rebellion against priesthood
   and the Judges:

     <p>"Nunc autem, quia circumcisio spiritalis esse apud fideles servos
     Dei coepit, spiritali gladio superbi et contumaces necantur, dum de
     Ecclesia ejiciuntur" [Ep. lxxii, ad Pompon., n. 4]

   <p>religion being now spiritual, its sanctions take on the same
   character, and excommunication replaces the death of the body.

   <p>Lactantius was yet smarting under the scourge of bloody persecutions,
   when he wrote his Divine Institutes in A.D. 308. Naturally, therefore,
   he stood for the most absolute freedom of religion. He writes:

     <p>"Religion being a matter of the will, it cannot be forced on
     anyone; in this matter it is better to employ words than blows
     [verbis melius quam verberibus res agenda est]. Of what use is
     cruelty? What has the rack to do with piety? Surely there is no
     connection between truth and violence, between justice and cruelty
     ..... It is true that nothing is so important as religion, and one
     must defend it at any cost [summâ vi] .... It is true that it must
     be protected, but by dying for it, not by killing others; by
     long-suffering, not by violence; by faith, not by crime. If you
     attempt to defend religion with bloodshed and torture, what you do
     is not defense, but desecration and insult. For nothing is so
     intrinsically a matter of free will as religion." [Divine
     Institutes V:20]

   <p>The Christian teachers of the first three centuries insisted, as was
   natural for them, on complete religious liberty, urging the principle
   that religion could not be forced on others: a principle always
   adhered to by the Church in her dealings with the unbaptised. However,
   the imperial successors of Constantine soon began to see in themselves
   as divinely appointed "bishops of the exterior", i.e. masters of the
   temporal and material conditions of the Church.

     <p>".... as though it were not permitted to come forward as avengers
     of God, and to pronounce sentence of death!.... But, say you, the
     State cannot punish in the name of God. Yet was it not in the name
     of God that Moses and Phineas consigned to death the worshippers of
     the Golden calf and those who despised the true religion?"
     [St. Optatus of Mileve: "De Schismate Donntistarum" III, cc. 6-7]

   <p>This was the first time that a Catholic bishop championed a decisive
   cooperation of the State in religious questions, and its right to
   inflict death on heretics. For the first time, also, the Old Testament
   was appealed to, though such appeals had been previously rejected by
   Christian teachers. St. Augustine, on the contrary, was still opposed
   to the use of force, and tried to lead back the erring by means of
   instruction:

     <p>"We wish them corrected, not put to death; we desire the triumph of
     (ecclesiastical) discipline, not the death penalties that they
     deserve." [St. Augustine Ep. c, n. 1]

   <p>St. John Chrysostom says substantially the same in the name of the
   Eastern Church:

     <p>"To consign a heretic to death is to commit an offence beyond
     atonement" [St Chrysostom: Hom., XLVI, c. i]

   <p>and in the next chapter he says that God forbids their execution, even
   as He forbids us to uproot cockle, but He does not forbid us to repel
   them, to deprive them of free speech, or to prohibit their assemblies.
   The help of the "secular arm" was therefore not entirely rejected; on
   the contrary, as often as the Christian welfare, general or domestic,
   required it, Christian rulers sought to stem the evil by appropriate
   measures. Nevertheless, a thousand years later a very liberal attitude
   reigned in the remnants of the Byzantine Empire:

     <p>"Show me just what Mohammed brought that was new, and there you
     will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to
     spread by the sword the faith he preached.... God is not pleased by
     blood, and not acting reasonably is contrary to Gods nature. Faith
     is born of the soul, not the body. Whoever would lead someone to
     faith needs the ability to speak well and to reason properly,
     without violence and threats.... To convince a reasonable soul, one
     does not need a strong arm, or weapons of any kind, or any other
     means of threatening a person with death." [Emperor Manuel II
     Paleologus "Seventh Conversation with a Persian" (1391)]

  <h>Traditional Teaching

   <p>Historically, the Roman Church has taken the following simple and easy
   to understand position "Error has no rights":
    <l>1. What is wrong must be damaging to individuals and society: else it
       isn't wrong!
    <l>2. Ideas can be as wrong as actions: at least because they give rise
       to harmful actions.
    <l>3. It is an important part of the mission of the Magisterium of the
       Church to identify
       and warn against mistaken and dangerous ideas.
          + Those holding seriously erroneous beliefs hazard eternal
            damnation.
          + Those resisting the judgement of the Magisterium hazard
            eternal damnation.
          + Any one engaging in respectful dialogue or social interaction
            with those holding
            seriously erroneous beliefs hazards eternal damnation.
          + Anyone hazarding eternal damnation should be excommunicated
            in order to alert them to the danger they are in.
    <l>4. It is wrong to inflict ignorance and error on others or to
       passively allow others to do this.
          + Those who hold and especially those who wish to propagate
            wrong ideas should
            be opposed, to safeguard their intended victims.
          + It is the duty of the civil authority to defend its citizens
            and/or subjects from harm.
    <l>5. It is the duty of the officers of any Catholic State to respect
       the judgements of the Magisterium.
          + Officers of any Catholic civil authority who neglect their
            duty to oppose error
            in accordance with the admonition of the Magisterium hazard
            eternal damnation,
            and should be excommunicated.
          + Clamour for "rights of free speech" and "freedom of religion"
            should be denied.
          + Dissidents should be ghettoized, deported, imprisoned or
            executed.
          + An "opportunity for repentance" should be given before
            execution,
            but the choice is always between recantation and death.
          + Regrettably, it may be the lesser of two evils for a Catholic
            State to offer
            limited toleration to those aiming to propagate wrong ideas,
            if on balance
            it seems that to be properly proscriptive would do more
            ancillary harm
            than it could be expected to prevent.

<h>Modern Teaching

   <p>Since the promulgation of the recent Vatican Synod's Declaration on
   Religious Liberty "Dignitatis Humanae", the Official Teaching has
   changed dramatically. It might now be characterized as follows:
    <l>1. It is an important part of the mission of the Magisterium of the
       Church to identify and warn against wrong ideas.
    <l>2. However, Freedom of religion is an inalienable human right [DH
       #2].
    <l>3. Civil authorities should therefore facilitate their citizens or
       subjects in the practice of any religion that does not immediately
       threaten civil upheaval [DH #3].
    <l>4. Those who hold wrong ideas in good faith should be allowed to
       freely propagate them, as long as there is no threat to public
       order [DH #3].
    <l>5. Those who hold wrong ideas in bad faith should be opposed.
    <l>6. Bad faith is always indicated when the Magisterium is directly
       challenged, but never otherwise, hence:

    <l>1. Those holding divergent beliefs who make no pretence to membership
       of the Roman Jurisdiction can safely be deemed to be in good faith
       and are to be respected.
    <l>2. Respectful dialogue, social interaction and common worship should
       be encouraged, at all levels, with those who hold seriously
       erroneous beliefs: as long as they do not pretend membership of
       the Roman Jurisdiction and so directly challenge its authority.
       The photograph shows Pope John Paul II kissing a copy of the
       Koran.
    <l>3. Those who claim membership of the Roman Jurisdiction while
       resisting the judgement of its Magisterium are manifestly in bad
       faith and should be excommunicated.
    <l>4. No dialogue should be countenanced with dissidents who claim
       membership of the Roman Jurisdiction.
    <l>5. In particular, adherents of the Old Liturgy are to be particularly
       singled out, because their insistence that the "reforms" were
       misguided hits at the foundations of the modern Church
       establishment, settlement and consensus.

     <p>Whereas it is the duty of the civil authority to defend its citizens
   and/or subjects from harm:
    <l>1. Freedom of  speech is an inalienable human right.
    <l>2. Dissidents should be opposed at most by argument and propaganda.
    <l>3. It is generally appropriate to tolerate the full expression of
       erroneous beliefs, as most are less damaging to society than the
       civil disorder that would result from any attempt to suppress
       them.
    <l>4. An exception is to be made in the case of homosexuality:
          + this is such a grave social evil as to merit special measures
          + there is unlikely to be a significant adverse violent
            reaction, as homosexuals are still a generally feared and
            hated minority.

  <h>A critique of the Traditional teaching

   <p>The traditional teaching is logical and sound: at least in the
   direction it takes, though uncongenial to modern ears. Those who are
   mistaken can have no right to seek to involve others in their
   mistakes.

     <p>"One who sincerely believes himself to be bound to practice some
     form of non-Catholic religion is in conscience obliged to do so;
     but this subjective obligation, based on an erroneous conscience,
     does not give him a genuine right. A real right is something
     objective based on truth." [Fr Connell: Am. Ecc. Rev. #108, Oct.
     1943]

   <p>If someone in error honestly believe themselves to be correct, they
   have a duty in conscience before God to attempt to subvert others to
   their mistaken viewpoint, but they have no right to do so. They cannot
   justly claim that others who oppose them, even by imposing constraints
   on them, do an injustice either towards them or towards the general
   population whom they wish to address. This principle is to be accepted
   not so much because it is the consistent teaching of the Ordinary
   Magisterium, though it is (as Mr Davies establishes in his pamphlet)
   but more because its negation is absurd.

   <p>The traditional teaching does however have one huge deficiency, the
   remedy of which does much to defuse the objections of a modern
   audience. This defect is simple. Inadequate allowance is made for the
   intellectual space that is required for faith to grow. The traditional
   teaching views the hierarchy of the Church as ultimately wise and
   knowledgeable, and the Magisterium certain and infallible on all
   matters. Similarly, it views the laity as ignorant. Hence, it asserts
   that they should be docile and entirely passive in receiving the
   teaching, admonitions and judgement of the Magisterium. The business
   of the laity is to do and believe what it is told. There is no need or
   place for question or debate  The laity have no competence to do
   either. If something cannot be understood or seems to be wrong, it
   must nevertheless be accepted without hesitation as right: just on the
   basis of authority. Whatever comprehension is appropriate should later
   be sought over time in prayer. Anyone with good will can be expected
   to recognize the truth of the Magisterium's decrees more or less
   immediately.

   <p>Now in fact, all this is far from the case. For those who are not
   Catholics, the Magisterium has no particular credibility and commands
   little respect. This is first because there is no reason why the
   opposite should be the case, and second because the Magisterium has
   manifestly been mistaken on a number of significant matters and has
   generally not had the grace to face up to this. Hence it is not
   reasonable that non-Catholics should be expected to respond positively
   and enthusiastically to the Magisterium. They will rather require
   persuasion!

   <p>As far as Catholics are concerned, it is wrong for the hierarchy to
   dismiss the laity as ignorant and incompetent. In as far as this is
   true, it is undesirable, and largely the fault of the hierarchy for
   failing to educate them. It is unreasonable to ask for blind faith,
   when Catholicism prides itself on having a high doctrine of human
   reason and its relationship with faith. Honesty is a prime virtue and
   requires that doubts and difficulties are faced and addressed openly,
   though with an attitude of faith not cynical scepticism. Only by
   recognizing and making explicit our doubts can we come, with the
   Blessed Apostle Thomas, to the conviction of a mature faith based on
   an encounter with Our Risen Lord.

  <h>A critique of the Modern Teaching

     <p>"This Vatican Synod declares that the human person has a right to
     religious freedom. This freedom means that all men are to be immune
     from coercion on the part of individuals or of social groups and of
     any human power, in such wise that in matters religious no one is
     to be forced to act in a manner contrary to his own beliefs. Nor is
     anyone to be restrained from acting in accordance with his own
     beliefs, whether privately or publicly, whether alone or in
     association with others, within due limits.
     The Synod further declares that the right to religious freedom has
     its foundation in the very dignity of the human person, as this
     dignity is known through the revealed word of God and by reason
     itself.
     <p>This right of the human person to religious freedom is to be
     recognized in the constitutional law whereby society is governed.
     This is to become a civil right....
     The exercise of this right cannot be interfered with as long as the
     just requirements of public order are observed."
     [Dignitatis Humanae #2]

   <p>Mr Davies remarks that this would all be compatible with traditional
   doctrine if either the words "or publicly" were omitted or "due
   limits" be understood as being determined by the objective common
   good. In fact, he points out that Dignitatis Humanae later says that
   they are to be determined by "public order", a much weaker and
   pragmatic criterion. In particular, the novel doctrine would seem to
   countenance objective injustices such as the sexual molestation of
   altar servers, so long as the practice was hushed up and didn't come
   into the public gaze and so result in riots (please excuse the irony).

   <p>Michael Davies goes on to establish that a variety of (liberal) modern
   commentators agree with him that the teaching of Dignitatis Humanae is
   novel:

     <p>"The star of the American delegation was John Courtney Murray whose
     chief function was to give the pedestrian bishops the right words
     with which to change some ancient doctrines without admitting that
     they were being changed." ["Paul Blanchard on Vatican II" (1966)]

     <p>"Lefebvre has every right to question the Council's Declaration on
     Religious Freedom, Kung says, because Vatican II completely
     reversed Vatican I's position without explanation ..... He
     reminisces over the late night conversations with Fr John Courtney
     Murray (the American who guided the Council thought on religious
     liberty): 'The Council bishops said, "It's too complicated to
     explain how you can go from a condemnation of religious liberty to
     an affirmation of it purely by the notion of progress."'"
     [Interview with Fr. H. Kung: National Catholic Reporter  (21st
     October 1977)]

     <p>"The course of the development between the Syllabus of Errors
     (1864) and Dignitatis Humanae Personae (1965) still remains to be
     explained by theologians"
     [Fr. J.C. Murray in "The Documents of Vatican II", ed W. Abbott
     (1967)]

     <p>"It cannot be denied that a text like this does materially say
     something different from the Syllabus of 1864, and even almost the
     opposite of propositions 15 and 77-79 of the document."
     [Fr. Y. Congar "Challenge to the Church" (1977)]

   <h>The famous liberal moral theologian Charles Curran has also said:

     <p>"As all recognize, the hierarchical magisterium finds change
     difficult and above all is most reluctant to admit that its
     teachings have been wrong and need to change. Perhaps the most
     significant change of the Second Vatican Council on a specific
     issue concerned the teaching of religious liberty. The major issue
     concerned not the teaching itself but the problem of change. How
     could the church teach in the twentieth century what it denied in
     the nineteenth? The problem was solved by a theory of development
     which claimed that the historical circumstances had changed so that
     the church was right in both centuries [J.C. Murray; in "Vatican
     II: La liberte religieuse", 111-147 Eds J. Hamer & Y congar
     (1967)]. I believe the unwillingness to admit that its teaching has
     been wrong constitutes the major reason why the hierarchical
     magisterium has not changed its teaching on artificial
     contraception. For all practical purposes Pope Paul VI admitted
     that in his encyclical Humanae vitae."
     [C.E. Curran : Address delivered after receiving the Bridge
     Building Award from New Ways Ministry (1992)]

    <p>I suspect that Dr Curran use of the word
   "solved" was ironic and that he no more believed that the "theory of
   development" expounded in french by Fr Murray in 1967 adequately
   explained the change of teaching than did Fr Murray himself, as quoted
   above speaking in English that same year.

   <p>The fact that the teaching of the Vatican Synod is novel and
   apparently contrary both to the overwhelming consensus of the Fathers
   and recent papal teaching does not necessarily make it wrong. The
   previous teaching was never defined. In any case, the change is mainly
   one of implementation and this might be justified by a change in
   circumstance.

   <p>Nevertheless, it seems to me that the novel teaching is incoherent.
   Quite apart from it contradicting what I have already described as
   "logical and sound", in practice the treatment of those who make no
   claim to be part of the Roman Jurisdiction is uncritically
   affirmatory, while that meted out to dissidents who do claim to be
   part of the Roman Jurisdiction is authoritarian and cruel. This
   suggests that the underlying motivation is insincere. The policy seems
   to be to show a gentle and tolerant face to outsiders: in order to
   build up their confidence and trust, then once they have been
   captivated by this seductive spell and become Catholic, to impose the
   most severe discipline. After all, someone who has just made such a
   huge and significant decision is hardly going to admit that they were
   wrong just afterwards! The hysteresis of faith will trap them.

   <p>The treatment of homosexuals recommended by the Magisterium to civil
   authority is particularly revealing. For some reason, while Islam;
   Buddhism; Voodoo and Scientology are to be tolerated, because they are
   religions, and their adherents accorded full civil rights - including
   the rights to indoctrinate and adopt children - homosexuals should be
   denied most civil rights, because they are supposed to have adopted a
   life style that is disordered! In fact, children need  no more
   protection from homosexuals, who have as such no motivation to
   "convert" anyone to anything, than from left-handed people!
   Contrariwise, it would be easy to put together an argument in favour
   of protecting children from religious fundamentalists of all kinds:
   including Secularists and conservative Catholics!

 <h>Cardinal Newman's after dinner toast

   <p>In brief Sr Waddelove argues that Cardinal Newman's famous statement:

     <p>"If I am obliged to bring religion into after dinner toasts (which
     indeed does not seem to be quite right) I shall drink to the Pope,
     if you please - still, to conscience first, and to the Pope
     afterwards"

   <p>has been wrongly used to vindicate a "do as you like" attitude, which
   Newman would never have endorsed.

   <p>She rightly points out that Newman also said that the "dictate" of
   conscience "in order to prevail against the voice of the Pope, must
   follow upon serious thought, prayer and all available means of
   arriving at a right judgement on the matter in question" also that the
   conscience must be convinced not just that it is allowable to ignore
   the Magisterium, but that it would be positively harmful to obey its
   command or accept its teaching. "Unless a man is able to say to
   himself as in the presence of God, that he must not and dare not, act
   upon the Papal injunction, he is bound to obey it and would commit a
   great sin in disobeying it". Newman was quite clear that what people
   often claimed as a right to conscience was nothing more than a
   pretence to the counterfeit "right of self-will". [Newman: "Certain
   Difficulties felt by anglicans in Catholic Teaching" II 261,258,250]
   On the other hand, she does a disservice to Newman when she asserts
   that he believed the standard conservative dogma that the litmus test
   of a true religious spirit was obedience.

   <p>She further points out that conscience can never set what is
   objectively right and wrong. Justice is not malleable. As my first
   quote from Michael Davies' pamphlet implies, the individual has no no
   right to decide for himself what is right and what is wrong, though I
   would add that he has the duty to seek to discern it. Nevertheless, Sr
   Waddelove correctly admits that conscience must always be obeyed, even
   when it is somehow misguided. She then states that we have two means
   of discovering what is just: the Natural Law (but she then passes over
   this, in haste) and Divine Revelation. She then equates the latter
   with the Magisterium and then suggests that Holy Mother Church makes
   solemn declarations on faith and morals which are to be taken as the
   voice of Christ Himself. She then glibly asserts that this constitutes
   sure guidance for the formation of conscience.

   <p>In this Sr Waddelove ignores or underestimates the importance of:
     <l>* the Natural Law, which is immediately accessible to every human
       being and is the imperative behind all rational judgements of what
       is just.

    * It should be noted that in Catholic thought, conscience is
       generally equated with the reason as applied to moral decisions.
     * According to Pope John-Paul II "conscience is a practical
       judgement .... an application of the law to a particular case."
       [Veritatis Splendor #59]
     * Contrariwise, most people use the word conscience to signify an
       intuition of right and wrong: their experience of instinctive
       premises being proposed to their reasons by the Natural Law.
    * As Pope John-Paul II (inconsistently) puts it "conscience is ...
       an inner dictate for the individual, a summons to do what is good
       in this particular situation" [Veritatis Splendor #59]

     <l>the Scriptures, which can be read and properly understood by anyone
   conversant with the Living Apostolic Tradition.

     <l>the Fathers, whose legacy can be read and properly understood by
   anyone conversant with the Living Apostolic Tradition.

     <l>the regrettable historical fact that the Magisterium is only too
   fallible. 
<p>Sr Waddelove then takes some delight in disparaging
   conscience. She points out that it can make mistakes, and that such
   mistakes are not always innocent. She suggests that because of
   original sin, one should expect a (wo)man's conscience to be mistaken
   in many matters. This sounds suspiciously like the Lutheran doctrine
   of "Utter Depravity". The distinct impression is that one's best
   option is to not worry about thinking issues through for oneself on
   the basis of objective values such as equity and freedom. Rather, it
   is safer to learn by rote the current policy positions of the
   Magisterium and apply these uncritically. In this way one avoids all
   moral responsibility for one's actions. If the Magisterium turns out
   to have got it wrong, it is always possible to say "I was only
   following orders".

   <p>This is, of course, an immoral "cop out". It is quite possible for
   someone to opt out of their God-given personal responsibility to judge
   right from wrong and then to act justly, from sloth. To such a person,
   unquestioning conformance to the Official Teaching of the Magisterium
   is the easy, painless, stress free option. Such a person sins, perhaps
   mortally, even when they believe and do what is objectively right,
   because their motivation is at heart negligent and imprudent.

   <p>Sr Waddelove concludes her article by quoting Pope John Paul II

     <p>"God who alone is good, knows perfectly what is good for man, and
     by virtue of his very love proposes this good to man in the
     commandments" [Veritatis Splendor #35].

   <p>She then correctly interprets this as meaning that God is not, then,
   laying down arbitrary rules to make life difficult or demanding for
   us, any more than the Church is, but rather, out of love, teaching
   what is intrinsically good for us, what will benefit us and lead to
   eternal beatitude. Of course, she fails to recognize (in her use of
   the word "is") that although the Magisterium should intend only to
   propose what is objectively good for (wo)men, as determined by their
   internal constitution and potential, sometimes in fact it get this
   wrong.

       <p>If Newman had believed regarding conscience what Sr Waddelove
                                 proposes,
    he would never have delivered the after dinner toast with which this
                               section began,
   and there wouldn't have been any need for Sr Waddelove to "explain it
                                   away".

     <p>"In its 'Declaration on Religious Freedom', Vatican II taught that
     'in forming their consciences the faithful must pay careful
     attention to the sacred and certain teaching of the church'. When
     that text was first proposed, a number of bishops noted the
     obvious:

  <p> One can 'pay careful attention to' a teaching and still disagree with
                                    it.

     They proposed that the text be changed to say that 'the faithful
     must form their conscience according to church teaching'. The
     commission responsible for rewriting the text claimed that the new
     wording proposed was 'too restrictive' and that the original text
     'sufficiently expressed the obligation binding the faithful'. This
     was put to a vote by the whole council, which by a vote of 2,033 to
     190, agreed with the commission. The formula recognizing the
     primacy of conscience remained therefore in the final text of
     Dignitatis Humanae. Commenting on this topic, one of the council's
     most famous theologians [Joseph Ratzinger] wrote: 'Over the pope as
     the expression of the binding claim of ecclesiastical authority,
     there still stands

        one's own conscience, which must be obeyed before all else,
         even against the requirement of ecclesiastical authority.

     <p>This emphasis on the individual, whose conscience confronts him
     with a supreme and ultimate tribunal, is one which in the last
     resort is beyond the claim even of the official church.'"
     [Charles Finnegan, OFM]

  <h>An attempted resolution

    <h>What is conscience?

   <p>Conscience has three elements.
    <l>1. It is the instinctive voice of the Natural Law.
   <l> 2. It is a reflexive ethical response to a situation, learned as a
       result of socialization.
    <l>3. It is reason applied to moral premises.

     <p>".... the Apostle says that they who have the law written in their
     hearts enjoy the testimony of a sound conscience. And this seems to
     compel us to consider what it is the Apostle calls conscience,
     whether it be some element distinct from the heart and from the
     soul. For of this conscience it is elsewhere said that it condemns
     and is not condemned, and judges a man but is not judged, as John
     says in the words: 'If our conscience condemn us not, we have
     boldness towards God'. And again Paul himself says in another
     place: 'For our glorying is this, the testimony of our conscience'.
     As then I observe such large freedom in that which ever rejoices
     and glories in good deeds, and in wrong deeds is not amused, but
     itself condemns and accuses the very soul to which it is attached,
     I hold that conscience is this very spirit which is said by the
     Apostle to exist with the soul, as we previously made clear; it is
     a sort of tutor and governor associated with it: to advise of the
     better course or to punish and accuse it for its faults. It is of
     this also that the Apostle says: 'No man knoweth the things of a
     man save the spirit of the man which is in him'. It must be the
     very spirit of conscience of which he says: 'The Spirit itself
     beareth witness with our spirit'. Possibly this is that very spirit
     which is attached to the souls of the righteous, which have in all
     things been obedient unto it. Hence it is written: 'Praise the
     Lord, ye spirits and souls of the righteous'. But if the soul be
     disobedient to it and obstinate, after death the spirit will be
     severed and separated from it. I suppose for this reason it is said
     of the Unjust Steward in the gospel that the Lord shall 'divide him
     and assign him his portion with the unfaithful'. Perhaps it is the
     same spirit of which it is written that: 'An incorruptible spirit
     is in man'." [Origen: Commentary on Romans, in "Selections from the
     Commentaries and Homilies of Origen", p55 translator: R.B.
     Tollinton]

   <p>Conscience as reason, has no option but to adhere to its first two
   elements, using the data they provide as its premises. However it is
   necessary to criticize all premises: even instinctive ones. It may be
   that the instinctive response is inappropriate in modern circumstances
   (e.g. the curling-up response of the hedgehog to the bright headlamps
   of the approaching car). Further, it might transpire that a learned
   response is not at all correct! Just because there is a consensus in
   one's family, tribe or religious group on some ethical question (e.g.
   capital punishment, slavery and polygamy are OK: but usury, cross
   dressing and incest are not) doesn't mean that the form this consensus
   takes is correct. Finally, I know from experience that it is easy to
   produce feelings of guilt, simply by accusing someone of mischief.
   When I was an child, I remember some incident of wrongdoing at school
   involving the contents of a cupboard. The teacher who was trying to
   identify the culprit confronted the whole class with what had
   happened, and I remember feeling very sheepish and guilty: though I
   was entirely innocent. Similarly, many feelings of guilt and shame
   associated with sex are inappropriate reflexive responses induced by
   social taboos and arbitrary decencies.

   <p>To an extent, conscience as reason can be applied to other data, such
   as the merely physiological. However, to deduce ethical conclusions
   from premises such as "it is necessary to breath in order to live",
   extra-scientific value judgements have to be recognized, such as "it
   is good to live" and "it is bad to coerce another rational person":
   hence, "it is wrong to strangle someone". The American (atheist)
   philosopher Ayn Rand has proposed that the single ethical premise
   required is simply "being is good". I am very sympathetic towards this
   view, but I am not convinced that it has been adequately established
   or elucidated. In any case, it is not possible to deduce any ethical
   conclusions about, for example, particular sexual behaviours from a
   simple observation such as that "the physiological basis for the
   existence of gender is reproduction".

    <h>What is the competency of conscience?

   <p>Because conscience is the facility for deciding what is right and
   wrong it should be sovereign. Far from being deranged by original sin,
   the ability to judge good from evil was obtained by the first human
   beings, as a direct result of what seems to have been a divinely
   engineered act of rebellion.

     <p>"In the depths of his conscience, man detects a law which he does
     not impose on himself, but which holds him to obedience .... For
     man has in his heart a law written by God.  To obey it is the very
     dignity of man: according to it he will be judged" [Gaudiem et
     Spes  #16]

   <p>Conscience may justly be challenged by external agents and is
   inevitably buffeted by the appetites. However, because it is the
   faculty that decides (to the best of its ability) what is right, the
   will should follow its conclusions in all circumstances. On occasion,
   conscience may decide that it is incompetent to determine what is
   right and that it is prudent to trust the judgement of some expert
   authority: but this is no less an exercise of its own jurisdiction "If
   you choose not to decide, you still have made a choice" [The RUSH song
   "Freewill", lyrics N. Peart]. However, it is not right to take this as
   a general stance, for that negates the whole God-given purpose of
   conscience: moral autonomy and personal responsibility.

     <p>"He that never changed any of his opinions never corrected any of
     his mistakes; and he who was never wise enough to find out any
     mistakes in himself will not be charitable enough to excuse what he
     reckons mistakes in others. We are only so free, that others may be
     free as well as we. Conscience without judgement is superstition."
     [Benjamin Whichcote in "The Cambridge Platonists" ed Campagnac]

   <p>I remember as a young man offering God my free-will: asking that I
   should just do what God wanted, automatically. This was quite wrong.
   It wasn't even the experience of the God-Man Jesus Christ. He had two
   wills: one temporal and human, the other eternal and divine. As a man,
   Jesus did not have certain knowledge, but had to rely on faith as we
   do. In the end, his human will necessarily conformed to his divine
   will, because superabundant grace was always present in his human
   soul. Still, doing what was right was often a painful struggle. We see
   this especially in the garden of Gethsemene. Any notion of
   "self-oblation" that involves a destruction of the self or an
   enslavement to God is profoundly un-Christian. With God's grace, we
   must each find our own way of taking on, participating in and so
   realizing the form of Christ. This cannot be mechanistic, neither is
   it passive. It is a struggle to give birth. Divinization brings each
   of us close to the heart of God, makes us sharers in His Nature:
   conforming our pattern of life to Justice. However, the diverse
   characters of the saints (compare the simplicity and docility of St
   Bernadette of Lourdes with the subtlety, sophistication and
   intransigence of St Athanasius of Alexandria!) make it very clear that
   there are as many ways of "imitating Christ" as there are disciples.

   <p>Sometimes we ignore the conclusions of our conscience and instead
   follow the impetus of base appetite. Generally, this is because we are
   inadequately convinced of the truth of our ethical conclusion (we do
   not have episteme: sure intuitive knowledge), and the allure of what
   seems to be easy thrill or safe comfort is only too apparent. Every
   time we do this, we reinforce our tendency to unrealistic "wishful
   thinking" and lower the value we give to objective right and wrong:
   the rational expectation of weal or woe. In doing so, we become more
   like irrational beasts, captivated by unthinking instinct and
   appetites. Even when the conclusion of our conscience is mistaken, we
   do ill to disobey it: for exactly this reason. We never can tell when
   our conscience is mistaken: so whenever we ignore it, we always rebel
   from rationality.

      <h>The self-oblation of St Ignatious Loyola

    <p>"Take, Lord, my liberty; receive my memory, my understanding and my
                                whole will.
              Whatever I have and posses you have given to me.
     To you I restore it wholly, to you I utterly surrender it for your
                                 direction.
    Give me only the love of you, with your grace, and I am rich enough:
           Nor do I ask for aught besides." [St Ignatious Loyola]

   <p>This seems to contradict what I have said, yet it is a prayer which I
   have valued and used for many years. I suppose the key word is
   "direction", which can be taken to mean control as in the diktat of a
   tyrant or command of a superior officer (remember that Ignatious had
   been a serving soldier before receiving his vocation to found the
   Jesuits). However, it does not have to be taken so. Direction can just
   as easily signify expert advice and guidance, and the import of the
   prayer is then not a plea to have one's autonomy destroyed but rather
   an expression of willingness to freely serve God out of love and
   confidence and also (and more importantly) to put into God's healing
   care the whole of one's being: as a sick patient accepts the direction
   of a physician.

    <h>What is the relationship between conscience and the Magisterium?

   <p>A particularly seductive version of the sin of sloth is to conform to
   the dictate of authority, when - if one was honest with oneself - one
   has good reason for believing it to be wrong. Cardinal Newman is right
   to say that it is often grievously sinful for a Catholic to dissent.
   This is because a Catholic has good reason to presume that the
   Magisterium is right when it speaks solemnly. If his own conclusions
   differ, it is much more plausible that he is mistaken out of ignorance
   or sin, than that the Church is wrong. However, when a Catholic's own
   conclusions impress with such troublesome weight as to overturn this
   presumption: dissent is not only proper, but an inescapable duty
   before Almighty God.

     <p>"Naturally, one could solve everything by saying that it is enough
     to obey the Vatican. I, however, can not share such a
     simplification: if one decides to accept uncritically all that the
     Magisterium tells him (supposing that the Magisterium does indeed
     always tell him what to do), such a person does nothing other than
     assume unto his own conscience the 'argument of authority'. He may
     indeed do this, but then he must know too that Saint Thomas
     considers such arguments of authority to be very week and ill -
     'Argumentum auctoritatis est infirmissimum'.

     <p>In reality one can never get around one's own conscience, for even
     when one decides to rely upon an authority outside one's self, one
     always needs to pass through one's own conscience, which in this
     case tells the person that the magisterium of this authority is to
     be accepted as valid. [Fr .Leandro Rossi: ''Chastity and
     Homosexuality'']

   <p>Thomas Aquinas addresses this subject.

     <p>"To the third objection (that any prelate would be superior to his
     subject and so should be able to expect automatic obedience): it
     must be said, that, even though a prelate is superior to his
     subject, however God, to Whose commandment the conscience binds, is
     greater than a prelate."
     [Aquinas De Veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 3]

   <p>There is no question here of taking an easy option. If dissent doesn't
   seem a more troublesome task than conformance, then it is suspect. The
   dissent that allows one to eat steak on Friday is a sham: no more than
   self gratification. The dissent that allows one to use contraception
   because it makes one's own life easier is also immoral. For dissent to
   be anything other than harmful, it has to be birthed in pain and fire,
   otherwise it will lead to cynical scepticism and a loss of all faith.
   Dissent based on a consciousness of an injustice done to some
   individual or group because of the imposition of some mistaken
   doctrine or practice is a different matter. This is a matter of
   charity for the victim(s) of injustice. It is a prime duty for every
   person of good will to defend victims of injustice: even if the
   perpetrator of the injustice is the Magisterium itself! It must be
   remembered that "Error has no rights" and this is as applicable to the
   case when the Magisterium is in error as to that when a private
   individual is mistaken.

   <p>The Magisterium has a responsibility to respect the conscience of
   individuals, simply because it has a responsibility for the welfare of
   all. Concern for the "Common Good" can only be based on a concern for
   the good of the individual, and central to this is a healthy, active
   and respected conscience. For the Magisterium to act in any way that
   violates the conscience of an individual is immoral. This does not
   mean to say that the Magisterium has to respect or tolerate error. The
   duty to proclaim the authentic Apostolic Tradition involves
   delineating what is right from what is wrong, as best can be done: and
   those who freely associate themselves with anathematized doctrine in
   conscience, thereby exclude themselves from the visible unity of the
   Roman Jurisdiction. Of course, they may have good (though inadequate)
   reasons for making the choice that they do and so be subjectively
   innocent of serious sin.

   <p>An interesting question arises. What about the issue of ordaining
   women to the Apostolic ministry? I have made it clear elsewhere that I
   believe there is no rational basis on which the present doctrinal
   position can be sustained. It is incoherent. Clearly, then, it is
   unfair to those women who aspire to the Apostolic ministry to deny
   them this means of service, but is it an injustice towards them? I'm
   not sure. On this basis alone, I think it would be difficult to
   recommend any kind of campaigning dissent. Indeed, because it would
   undoubtedly be harmful to ecumenical prospects with the Eastern
   Orthodox Church for the Roman Jurisdiction to ordain women, a case can
   be made out for this issue to be "left on the back burner" for the
   time being. Still, I suppose an injustice is being done to the laity
   as a whole, for they are suffering as a result of being denied pastors
   who would be able to serve them well. Moreover, the recent papal
   letter which tried to stifle all debate on this matter upped the
   stakes. The issue now is not whether a woman can be made a priest, but
   whether it is right for the Pope to forbid all Catholics from
   questioning a matter that has not been defined. Clearly, this is a
   matter of sufficient gravity to merit explicit challenge!

   <p>What of the case when an individual rebels from erroneous Church
   teaching because they have an intuition that it is wrong, but have not
   properly thought this through and to an extent acts precipitously?
   Objectively they act justly, and the Magisterium is wrong to impose
   its error on the faithful. Nevertheless, the individual should have
   paid more respect to the Teaching Office before deciding to dissent.
   Yet, in fact they were right in their informal conclusion and the
   actions that flowed from it, and it was wrong that they were ever put
   in the position that they were. Has the individual in question:
    <l>1. sinned mortally: because they were imprudent to reject the
       mistaken teaching of the Magisterium, which they had a duty to
       presume trustworthy;
    <l>2. sinned venially: because somehow the matter is of limited
       consequence or
    <l>3. acted virtuously: in accordance with the Natural Law, which they
       instinctively obeyed, in a "child-like" manner; rather than
       respecting a normally trusted voice which on this occasion spoke
       falsely?

    <h>How should the Church treat those at variance with the Magisterium?

   <p>I suggest that the basis of policy should be that of facilitating the
   evangelization of non-Catholics, rather than the intimidation of those
   tempted to rebel or the censorship of those in error.

   <p>It is only possible to persuade someone of something if one treats
   them with respect. This is exactly what one should mean by "liberty of
   conscience". Attempts to indoctrinate or coerce are apt to alienate
   anyone subject to such abuse - even if the attempt is well
   intentioned. Treating someone with respect involves an unfeigned
   desire to understand their opinions, views and beliefs. Quite apart
   from other considerations, it is hugely advantageous to be able to
   empathize with someone and with their world view when trying to
   persuade them of something different. Authentic evangelization can
   only be a two-way learning process. The fact that "error has no
   rights" doesn't mean that those in error may not graciously be
   accorded liberties to which they have no just claim in order to seduce
   them to the truth.

   <p>When I engage in respectful dialogue with a protagonist whom I believe
   to be in error, it is not necessary to suspend my conviction that they
   are wrong. Neither is it necessary to suspend my own orthodoxy. It is
   necessary, however, for me to freely admit that:

     <l>I might be dramatically wrong, though I am convinced that I am not.

     <l>I may well be wrong in detail.

     <l>I may well have overlooked significant issues.

     <l>I certainly have much to learn.

     <l>I expect that much of what my protagonist believes will turn out to
   be reasonable, even where at first it does not seem so.

     <l>I expect that my protagonist has something significant to teach me.

     <p>"Indeed when I observe that Moses, a prophet filled with God, to
     whom God spoke face to face, received advice from Jethro, a priest
     of Midian, my mind grows bewildered, so great is my surprise. For
     the Scripture says, 'So Moses hearkened to the voice of his
     father-in-law and did all that he said unto him'. He did not say,
     To me God speaks; what I am to do is told me by a voice from
     heaven; how shall I receive advice from a man, a man who is a
     Gentile, a stranger to the people of God? No, he listens to his
     voice, and does all he says, and gives ear not to the speaker but
     to his words. This shows that we also, if we chance any time to
     find something wisely said by the Gentiles, should not straightway
     reject along with the status of the speaker also the things he has
     said; nor, because we have the law given by God, ought we to swell
     with pride and to reject the words of wise men, but rather to do as
     the Apostle says, 'Proving all things, holding fast that which is
     good'."  [Origen: Homilies on Exodus, in "Selections from the
     Commentaries and Homilies of Origen", p188-189 translator: R.B.
     Tollinton]

   <p>This is an attitude of open-ness rather than triumphalism. It does not
   deny the objectivity of truth, nor faith in the Gospel, nor confidence
   in the teaching authority of Holy Mother Church. It simply admits to
   the finitude and provisionality of all human understanding, no matter
   how solidly God inspired!

     <h> Unbelievers

   <p>I suppose that in practice the Church's modern policy is appropriate
   when dealing with people of no definite religious convictions. Perhaps
   a bit more conviction in the truth of the Gospel is to be desired.
   Certainly, a good deal more importance should be given to
   evangelization in Western Europe.

      <h>Infidels

  <p>It is not possible to avoid the syllogism that if error is error then
   it must be harmful. From this, the general conclusions of the
   traditional teaching follow. However, as I have already intimated, it
   is itself an error to coerce others, except in emergency, even for
   their own good! Hence, for the Church to act with hostility towards
   protagonists of other faiths is generally counter  productive. Debate,
   discussion and dialogue is a more appropriate response. This is the
   best way of encouraging the adherents of other religions to consider
   the intellectual case for Catholicism. On the other hand, even the
   appearance of prayer in common (as at Assisi) is to be avoided,
   because this countenances the idea that another religion is
   equivalently valid. While it is praiseworthy for the faithful to be
   warned of what is understood to be wrong with for example Islam,
   Buddhism or Shinto: it is profoundly inappropriate to condemn
   adherents of non-Christian religions as damned, and the positive
   values and aspects of these traditions should be readily and
   enthusiastically acknowledged.

      <h>Jews

   <p>The Jews are a special case, given that Catholicism originated from
   Judaism and has much in common with it. Rather than single the Jews
   out for special vilification and persecution, as has been the Church's
   official policy for many centuries, they should be singled out for
   special honour. The Church can expect to have a lot to learn from
   Judaism, in particular regarding ethics and the doctrine of grace.

      <h>Heretics and Schismatic

   <p>Policy should be based on the hope of winning back "the separated
   brethren" to full communion with the "One Catholic Apostolic Roman and
   Evangelical Church" rather than on the fear of the harm that could
   result from the spread of error. The latter danger can be most easily
   addressed by educating the laity, not intimidating them! If the Church
   had true courage in Her convictions, then She wouldn't be so keen to
   use threats of damnation to dissuade her ignorant children from
   repudiating Her jurisdiction nor violence to coerce those who have
   once left, back into Her fold.

   <p>It should be admitted that the Catholic Church is a far from perfect
   participation in the ideals of the "Body of Christ" and "Kingdom of
   God". Equally, it should be clearly admitted that many who reject the
   Catholic faith or Roman jurisdiction have excellent (if never
   adequate) grounds for doing so, and are in good faith. The typical
   evangelical protestant may be a lot closer to God than his Catholic
   contemporary: whether (s)he be lay (wo)man, or hierarch.

   <p>Ecumenism is a necessary aspect of the evangelism of non-Catholic
   christians, for many reasons, such as:
    <l>1. The Catholic Church has much to learn from other Christian bodies.
    <l>2. The Catholic Church may influence other Christian bodies, so
       reducing the perceived differences.
    <l>3. Working together for common aims (e.g. justice and peace) can
       cement friendship and establish trust.
    <l>4. Sympathetic theological debate may produce a real convergence of
       doctrine.
    <l>5. Ecumenical familiarity may make it easier for individuals to
       become Catholic.
    <l>6. A growth in understanding may pave the way for the reconciliation
       of entire jurisdictions with Rome.

      <h>Dissidents

   <p>The most difficult case for the hierarchy to deal with is that of
   dissidents within their own jurisdiction. This is because dissidents
   directly challenge hierarchical authority. The fear of the priest is
   always that the trouble-maker he is opposing might just turn out to be
   prophetic and enunciating the judgement of God! To an extent, the
   difficulty is of the hierarchy's own manufacture. Dissidents often are
   constructed by the hierarchy's own unwillingness to engage in dialogue
   with the rest of the Church. If a person or group comes to realize
   that their voice or need or experience is being discounted in a matter
   that is important to them then they have no choice but to dissent.
   This involves either public protest or private reservation.

   <p>Take the example of "Tridentinism". This would never have arisen if
   Paul VIth had not apparently outlawed the celebration of the
   traditional liturgy and autocratically imposed the Novus Ordo Missae.

   <p>Take the example of "Women Priests". The present discipline could have
   been continued while polite and restrained debate went on. While
   important, this issue is not urgent: unlike many others which the
   Magisterium studiously avoids addressing. There was no justification
   for the recent papal attempt to impose uniformity of thought without
   the bother of infallibly defining exactly the point at issue. This
   might have (in prudence) involved consulting at least the rest of the
   hierarchy, if not the wider Church!

   <p>Take the example of "Contraception". Paul VIth went to the trouble of
   constituting a commission to report on this subject, and then
   disregarded its conclusions. This turned the majority of the laity (I
   suspect) into de-facto dissidents and did incalculable harm to the
   credability of the Magisterium.

   <p>Take the example of "Homosexuality". For almost two thousand years the
   Magisterium of the Church remained silent on this subject. For
   substantial periods of time ecclesial attitudes were either tolerant
   or affirmatory. Why did it suddenly become necessary for Rome to
   enunciate such derogatory judgements? Does the Church need a group to
   vilify? Now that it has decided it can no longer target Jews, Witches
   and Muslims, has it identified homosexuals as the most convenient
   "whipping boy"?

   <p>There is no need for me to set out here the sensible path of action,
   as this has been done for me in great detail and with much wisdom, by
   the late Cardinal Bernadin.

    <h>How should the Church advise the Catholic State to treat non Catholics?

   <p>In his pamphlet, Mr Davies quotes Mgr G.W. Shea:

     <p>Before another word is said on the subject, let it be noted at once
     that no Catholic holds or may hold that the state would be called
     upon to impose the Catholic faith on dissident citizens. Reverence
     for the individual conscience forbids this, and the very nature of
     religion and of the act of faith. If these be not voluntary they
     are nought.
     [Mgr G.W. Shea: The American Ecc. Rev. (1950)]

   <p>before himself saying that

     <p>It is a fundamental principle of Catholic theology that no one must
     ever be forced to act against his conscience either in public or in
     private (unfortunately this principle has not always been respected
     in the history of the Church). It is equally true that no one be
     prevented from acting in accordance with his conscience in private
     (providing that no breach of the natural law is involved). [M.
     Davies, 1980]

   <p>I suppose that by "breach of the natural law" Mr Davies inaccurately
   means to refer to objectively evil acts that infringe the well-being
   or rights of others and do not have their consent: e.g. murder;
   abortion; rape; torture; enslavement; brain-washing or robbery, rather
   than acts such as smoking tobacco; suicide; contraceptive sexual
   intercourse or masturbation!

   <p>This means that the most repressive measures open to a Catholic State
   are to deny dissidents any right
    <l>1. of access to the public media.
    <l>2. to distribute their own literature in public.
    <l>3. to advertise their existence or activities.
    <l>4. of public assembly.
    <l>5. to build, hire or buy premises for the sole or primary purpose of
       worship or assembly.

   <p>The State could also sponsor "public information" warnings against
   dissidents.

   <p>Of course, some of these measures would serve little purpose and
   others would be counter productive. In practice it might be better to
   employ very much gentler measures.

   <p>It would be illegitimate to deny dissidents the right:
    <l>1. to produce literature for their own use or to pass on to others,
       in private.
    <l>2. to attempt to persuade others to adopt their beliefs, in private.
    <l>3. to assemble, in private.
    <l>4. to use premises that they own for other legitimate purposes as
       places of worship or assembly.
    <l>5. to form "front organizations" with legitimate ends.
    <l>6. to publicize the activities of such front organizations, as long
       as their dissident character is not apparent.

   <p>It would also be wrong to have any kind of legal presumption that a
   person who becomes a dissident is "mentally incompetent" or has been
   "brain-washed", and so should be subject to psychiatric treatment such
   as "de-programming".

   <p>In my opinion, the only sensible measure would be to restrict the
   style and position of buildings dedicated to dissident use so as to
   make them unobtrusive. If the State were to act to protect its
   citizens from all perceived "wrong ideas", then healthy political free
   speech, science and philosophy would be under serious threat.
   Innovative and imaginative insights in most fields of human endeavour
   are too often first rejected by the establishment as wrong-headed,
   subversive and dangerous!

    <h>Mill on Liberty

   <p>Quite by accident, I have recently read J.S. Mill's monograph on
   "Liberty". I found it to be an exciting and thought provoking book,
   and heartily recommend it. Mill points out that there are a number of
   reasons for allowing or even encouraging dissent:
    <l>1. Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is entirely wrong.

    1. In which case the only hope that truth and justice may be attained
       is by giving head to dissenting voices.
    2. A minority view should not be allowed to prevail or be accepted as
       correct any more than the majority view: but it requires more
       institutional support and consideration just because it is a
       minority or dissident view.
    3. Generally, dissident views are repressed and silenced by
       overbearing authority: hierarchical, social or economic, with no
       account as to their rightness or justice.
    4. On those occasions that unconventional truth has prevailed against
       popular falsehood, it has done so when civil or social authority
       has been in a state of flux, and so vulnerable to such a healthy
       subversion.
    5. A good example, is the official Catholic and Orthodox teaching on
       "love, sex and friendship".

     <l>Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is partly right and
   partly wrong.
    1. In which case, the corrective or complement of its partial truth
       may be supplied by some dissident view; itself only partly right.
    2. A good example here is the necessary dialogue between Western
       Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

     <l>Received conventional or "traditional" wisdom is entirely correct.
    1. Without the challenge of debate, it will ossify into what Cardinal
       Newman called "Notional Assent".
    2. This is an empty formal acceptance of some proposition as being
       true, with no understanding of what it signifies, and certainly
       without the acceptance of its truth having any practical impact on
       the conduct of one's life!
    3. This is typical of most Catholics today.
    4. It is the entire basis of conventional "Ecumenism".
    5. Because their faith is neither challenged by external persecution
       nor by their own attempts to convert non-Catholics to the True
       Faith, most Catholics have little idea of what in fact they
       believe.
    6. The irritent of dissidence (but of disidence challenged and
       engaged, not simply winked at and "tollerated") is necessary to
       produce the pearls of practical wisdom and living faith.
    7. The acceptance of dogma, on the basis of "authority" alone is an
       empty acceptance, and no amount of positive study and
       rationalisation can make up the deficit left once the external
       challenge of controversy has been lost.

   <p>While the hot restlessness of heretics stirs up questions about many
   things belonging to the Catholic faith, in order to provide a defense
   against these heretics we are obliged to study the points questioned
   more diligently, to understand them more clearly,  and to preach them
   more forcefully; and thus the question raised by the adversary becomes
   the occasion for instruction. [St. Augustine in "The Faith of the
   Early Fathers, Vol. 3, p. 103.]

  <h>Appendix: Extract from De Veritate

   <p>The whole 17th question is interesting, on the Conscience. This is
   just part of article Five of Question 17.

     <p>De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 1
     Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod ille qui vovit obedientiam, tenetur
     obedire in his ad quae bonum obedientiae se extendit; nec ab ista
     obligatione absolvitur per errorem conscientiae, nec iterum a
     conscientiae absolvitur ligamine per istam obligationem: et ita
     manet in eo duplex contraria obligatio. Quarum una, scilicet quae
     est ex conscientia, est maior, quia intensior; minor vero quia
     solubilior; alia vero e contrario. Obligatio enim illa quae est ad
     praelatum, solvi non potest, sicut conscientia erronea potest
     deponi.

     <p>To the first it must be said, that he who has vowed obedience, is
     held to obey in those things to which the good of obedience extends
     itself; neither is he freed from that obligation by an error of
     conscience, nor again is he freed from the duty of conscience by
     that obligation; and thus there remains in him a double contrary
     obligation. Of which the one, to wit that which is of the
     conscience, is greater, in that it is intenser; and lesser in that
     it is more soluble. The other one from the contrary. For the
     obligation which exists to the prealte, cannot be dissovled, as the
     erroneous conscinece can be set aside.

     <p>De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 2
     Ad secundum dicendum, quod quamvis opus illud per se sit
     indifferens, tamen ex dictamine conscientiae fit non indifferens.

     <p>To the second it must be said, that even though a work in itself be
     indifferent, however it is not indifferent to the dictate of the
     consciemce.

     <p>De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 3
     Ad tertium dicendum, quod quamvis praelatus sit superior subdito,
     tamen Deus, sub cuius praecepti specie conscientia ligat, est maior
     quam praelatus.

     <p>To the third it must be said, that, even though a prelate is
     superior to his subject, however God, to Whose commandment the
     conscience binds, is greater than a prelate.

     <p>De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 4
     Ad quartum dicendum, quod subditus, non habet iudicare de praecepto
     praelati, sed de impletione praecepti, quae ad ipsum spectat.
     Unusquisque enim tenetur actus suos examinare ad scientiam quam a
     Deo habet, sive sit naturalis, sive acquisita, sive infusa: omnis
     enim homo debet secundum rationem agere.
     To the fourth it msut be said, that the subject does not have to
     judge the commandment of the prelate, but rather the carrying out
     of the command, which is expected of him. For Everyone is beholden
     to examine his own deeds according to the knowledge which he has
     from God, wether that be natural, or acquired, or infused: for
     every man must act according to reason.
