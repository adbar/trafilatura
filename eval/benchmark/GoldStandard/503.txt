                               <h>Stacy's Story

   <p>In 10th grade, I was dating my to be (1st) husband. I was on the pill,
   was religious about taking it, and he used condoms. Some how, I ended
   up pregnant.

   I lived with my soon to be divorced financially poor mother, who had
   already been married 3 times (she's now has been married 5) who cared
   more about her love life then her children. She worked full time
   during the day, and most nights spent with her boyfriend/husband,
   whoever that was. My oldest brother had been sent to live with my
   grandparents when my stepfather told my mother to choose between him
   and my brother. This happened after an incident where the same
   stepfather tried to strangle my brother to death, and my brother had
   to fight back, breaking the stepfathers arm with a pool stick. My
   youngest brother was soon to be placed in a group home because he was
   in desperate need of attention, and the only way he knew how to get it
   was by acting out. He stayed in group homes until he was 18. My mother
   never really made an effort to get him out. I went to a school that
   was very small. Teenage pregnancies were the scandal to top scandals,
   and all the girls (all 2 of them) that had stayed in school while
   pregnant and having a child were seen as sluts, lower then low,
   immoral and disgusting. I had been physically, mentally, emotionally
   and sexually abused during my life. In my mind, abstinence was not an
   option. Most victims of sexual abuse often see sex as the way to
   express "love", and therefore do as they have been taught. I was no
   different. I knew how to get pregnant, I knew how to prevent it to the
   best of my ability, and I thought I had done the best I could.

   <p>I was not emotionally or physically ready to be pregnant. I was
   seriously under weight. I was wearing size 2 jeans at 57 tall. My diet
   consisted of 1 diet Pepsi and a package of crackers, and then a small
   dinner at night. I had no family or friend support. This was my life.
   Adoption was not an option. It had been implied heavily to me that if
   I ever came up pregnant that I would be made to keep the baby, and
   adoption would not be considered.

   <p>I went in to my doctor and had a pregnancy test done and had the
   results that afternoon. I called my boyfriend and I cried for days. I
   remember sitting in school thinking about the fact that my future, as
   grim as even I had perceived it to be, was over, and that the life
   style that I so hated in my mother, was now my life and future as
   well.

   <p>My boyfriend and I talked for 1 1/2 weeks about our options. He left
   the decision up to me. My body, my decision is what he said. To this
   day, I respect him for that, even when I respect him for nothing else.

   <p>I came to the final decision to have an abortion. It was paid for by
   my boyfriends childhood comic book collection. I made the appointment
   with the only doctor in the nearest big town who performed the
   procedure and on May 12, 1988 I had an abortion. I remember we skipped
   school, which was easy enough for me since I was writing my own
   excusal notes anyway. We went to a lake and I remember sitting under a
   tree and thinking about what I was about to do. I understood that I
   was ending a pregnancy. I understood that I was ending a potential
   child. I also understood that for my life there was no other option. I
   may have been 16 years old, but I had long ago grown up and fully
   understood what was going on around me.

   <p>I went in, had an ultrasound done to determine the gestational age of
   the fetus. I was told what my other options were and then it was
   explained to me what was going to happen.

   <p>A day or two after I became ill and had to go to the hospital. I had
   to call my mother to take me to the hospital, and in the car I had to
   explain why I was sick. My mother, upon finding out that I had had an
   abortion informed me about how mad she was at me, and how if she had
   been informed, she would have made me keep the baby. A woman who
   couldn't take care of the children she had was telling me she would
   raise mine. A joke in its own words.

   <p>I had a severe pelvic infection that caused me to be in the hospital
   for a week. The doctor who happened to be on-call made a thousand
   efforts to humiliate me for my decision. He attempted to belittle me,
   put me down, even went as far as telling me I had murdered my baby.
   This all going on while I was being given morphine for the pain, and
   him doing pelvic exams in such a manner where he knew it caused
   extreme pain. During my stay in the hospital, I was informed that
   there was scarring of my uterus and that my chances of ever getting
   pregnant again were slim. I accepted that. At that point, the only
   one's who knew about the abortion were my boyfriend, his mother, my
   mother and my stepfather. It was a private situation that in the end
   became very public. After my mother and step-father divorced, he got
   rip roaring drunk, drove to my grandparents, and in front of them and
   my aunt and uncle, told them about my abortion. This was several
   months after, and I was then forced to deal with my very pro-life
   family and their condensation and moral beliefs. The information got
   around to everyone in my school, and over the last 14 years, either
   from "friends" or family members, I've had the abortion thrown back in
   my face, either to attempt to hurt me on or to further a pro-life
   cause. I made peace with my decision 14 years ago and have never felt
   ashamed. I have learned that those who attempt to use it against me
   are petty, judgmental imbeciles. They deserve no more respect from me
   then they give to me. I have been at peace with my decision to long
   now to feel hurt from strangers, or even family members for that
   matter.

   <p>People say that its Gods will if we end up with an unwanted pregnancy.
   If I believed in the same God, I guess I would agree, however, I dont
   think most would like the reasons why I agree.

   <p>I believe that God allowed me to get pregnant at age 16 (despite being
   on the pill & using condoms), and he allowed me to have an abortion,
   and he allowed me to have the complications I had, and all so that I
   would not conceive again for 14 years. I believe he wanted me to be
   truly ready to be a mother, to come to terms with the abuse of my
   past, to learn anger management, self control and self preservation
   and to make sure that I had fixed what was broken in me before I ever
   attempted to have a child. I have learned how to love myself and you
   have to be able to love yourself before you can truly love someone
   else, and that does include a child. I am not the person I was 14
   years ago. The person I was then was nothing more then a shadow with
   no self worth. I have had 14 years to grow into a person that loves
   herself, her family, and her new daughter more then life itself. I
   look at my daughter and know that inevitably, had I not had the choice
   to terminate a pregnancy 14 years earlier, she wouldnt be here today.

   <p>I believe that a God does see all, far into the future, and just as he
   created us, he created our minds to create the technology that we have
   created, and that does include abortionist methods.

   <p>Had I been forced to have a child, I would have found a way to end the
   pregnancy myself, in whatever unsafe method that be. If I did not
   succeed, I would have killed myself. This is why I have a full
   understanding that for some women, continuing a pregnancy can and will
   be detrimental to her health. I have a very pro-life family, and I
   know for a fact that had I kept that child, they wouldn't have been
   there to follow through with helping me and I would have been left to
   flounder in the parental tidal pool by myself. Why? Because now, 14
   years later, the majority of them aren't around to emotionally help me
   with the child I have now.

   <p>Pregnancy is not as black and white as we want it to be. Comparing one
   pregnancy to another cannot be done. My ex-sister-in-law was pregnant
   at 15 and kept her child, and she was able to finish school and go to
   college, getting her Masters. Comparing her pregnancy to mine though
   is illogical. She had financial and emotional support from family &
   friends that I would have never been able to obtain. Abortion, in many
   cases, is not an easy decision to be made, nor one that is made within
   hours of the positive pregnancy test. I spent hundreds of hours, for
   1-½ weeks thinking about my options, and it was not a decision that
   was made easily. Hinting that one makes the decision as easily as they
   decide what color shirt to wear today, is in most cases the biggest
   line of crap a pro-lifer can come up with. Sorry, I dont buy it.

   <p>Yes, right now I would have had a 14 year old child... or maybe I
   would have been in my grave for 14 years after committing suicide or
   from dying from whatever method of self-abortion I tried to end the
   pregnancy... or maybe I was murdered by my abusive boyfriend or
   husband... or perhaps that 14 year old child was dead because I had
   abused them because I had not had the opportunity or chance to
   overcome the abuse of my past. Saying "you would have had a 14 year
   old child" is not necessarily true. Any of the above scenarios could
   be the sentence you should be thinking. The end result of an unwanted
   pregnancy is not always the birth of a child. It can very well be the
   end of the life of the mother. This is why I am pro-choice, and why I
   will always be pro-choice. Had abortion been illegal 14 years ago, I
   very well would not be here today. Taking the decision to have that
   abortion away from me would have solved nothing. I would have found a
   way to have it done, either by illegal abortion methods, self-abortion
   methods, or committing suicide.
