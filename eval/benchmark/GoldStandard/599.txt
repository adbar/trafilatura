   <p>I really enjoyed working on this course, and, as a teacher, greatly
   appreciate the professional way your course is presented. It was
   extremely challenging, but well worth the effort. Thank you for
   organizing such an effective program.

   <p>"I'm writing to you to say thanks for the training program I received
   from National Tax Training School. This is my first venture into my
   own business and I must say it was a success."

   <p>Thank you for the knowledge I gained from your tax program. How the
   course has been designed was absolutely excellent. During my study, I
   was able to give tax advice to my husband and his friend that saved
   them money last tax season. I could see that I will have better
   opportunities.

                                                 <h>L. F. K. - Caldwell, TX 
   <p>I am very pleased with the outcome of this. I think your organization
   provides a great course and I look forward to enrolling in the higher
   course once I have completed the initial course. Thank you very much
   for your time and assistance ....

   <p>I would like to compliment you on a well written and thorough program.
   Your Higher Course in Federal Taxes is one of the best I have taken.

   <p>I learned twice more from this course than the class of 4 credits
   attended and taken in college!

                                                   <h>M. S. - Charlotte, NC 
   <p>Your course is very well set up for maximum learning efficiency. The
   practice questions, with answers following immediately after, are
   perfect. I intend to take the advanced course as well as regular
   continuing education. Thank you for a very enjoyable learning
   experience and for you help.

   <p>"I've just completed my third year as an income tax practitioner with
   much success after graduating from NTTS ... Now that I have
   established my reputation as a good and reliable income tax
   consultant, several small businessmen have approached me to keep their
   books for them too ..."

   <p>Dear Student Advisor,
   <p>I want to thank you for all your help and support. I'll never forget
   all you've done for me.
   <p>May God bless you and your family. What you've given will last a
   lifetime.

   <p>"I must tell you that I thought your course was absolutely excellent!
   I'm just beginning to work on my own income tax return and I have
   already saved $500 that I would not have known about had I not taken
   your course. (My husband, I might add, is delighted). Thank you so
   much.

   <p>I found the practical case studies very helpful in pulling the whole
   program together. I am currently working for a small accounting firm
   and am involved in income tax preparation .... your course definitely
   provided a solid foundation.

                                            <h>D. A. D. - Niagara Falls, NY 
   <p>I would like to take this time and tell you how much I have enjoyed
   taking this course. It was very informative, and challenging. I would
   definitely recommend it to anyone that is interested in Income Tax in
   passing, or seriously, like myself. If I am fortunate, and pass my
   final exam and get my certificate, I am hoping to have my own small
   business.

   <p>In Charge of 14 Tax Offices
   <p>"Although I had not yet finished my NTTS course I was considered good
   enough to teach income tax for the ... Tax Service Company. This was
   my first encounter with tax work other than as an NTTS student. The
   next tax season I worked for the same company as an office manager
   with 4 tax preparers under my supervision. That season we did 50% more
   business than that office had done during the previous three years.
   The office won a prize for greatest increase in revenue of all city
   offices and I won a prize for the highest average charge of all the
   employees in the city area. I also received mention for the largest
   number of business returns in my type of office. After the season I
   represented many of my company's clients at IRS audits and did other
   part-time work for them. The following season I was offered and
   accepted a position as acting assistant city manager and trouble
   shooter for 14 local offices."

   <p>"Being retired I know how hard it is to find enjoyable, helpful and
   profitable employment - especially if you have been accustomed to
   working with your head and not your hands ... I can't resist offering
   the suggestion that you make a special effort to reach the vast army
   of retired clerical workers, executives, etc. What a big favor it
   would be to many of these people if they enrolled in NTTS. I know. I
   did and now I'm happily employed as my own boss - I'm a tax
   consultant, thanks to NTTS."

   <p>"I love my tax business ... Today I purchased a new car all from tax
   business earnings; I worked just part-time from January 1 to April
   15."

                                                   <h>A.T.S. Somerset, Mass.

   <p>"It has been 11 years since I took your training course and it was a
   fortunate step, even though I was an accounting graduate ... At first
   I only did taxes on a part-time basis since I was working for someone
   else, but when I was let go by my employer, I decided to go into
   business full-time. This I have never regretted, and year after year I
   have continued to grow ..."

   <p>"I would like to take this opportunity to say that due to your Federal
   Income Tax Course I have established a flourishing practice. I am
   still on a part-time basis, yet word of mouth advertising on the part
   of last year's clients and no effort on my part has kept me busy so
   far this year.

   <p>Saved One Client $9,000!
   <p>"I want to thank you for your help in making my future better.
   Incidentally, I have saved many people much money; one person I saved
   $9,000, which gives me much pleasure."

   <p>"I look forward to another tax season. It is a very challenging,
   enjoyable, rewarding and profitable second occupation for me."

   <p>"Since I finished my course through your school, I've worked part-time
   each year preparing tax returns. I thank you very much as I wouldn't
   take anything for the knowledge I obtained from your correspondence
   course. Since that time my daughter has finished high-school and she
   is interested in tax work, too."

   <p>... Thanks again for your help. Enjoyed the course. It is well
   written.

   <p>"I've enjoyed studying the course and I feel that I've learned so
   much. I know I was slow in getting the exams in but I studied and read
   every chapter until I felt that I really knew it. I want to thank you
   for your patience and time ... I shall continue to keep in touch with
   you. I worked last tax season and showed the results of studying your
   course. I am very grateful that I had the opportunity."

   <p>"Thanks to your tax course I now have a growing business ... In fact,
   I am still asked to do taxes for my clients who have moved out of New
   York State."

   <p>"This past tax season I had 1,350 clients in and did all the work
   myself. I'm sure you will agree that this is quite a load for one
   person and I may cut back a little this year and not overload myself
   so much."

   <p>"I received a certificate from you after completing your tax course
   and have found it to be one of the better moves of my life ... Thank
   you for your assistance. It sure helped me to enjoy a great profession
   as well as owning my own business today."
