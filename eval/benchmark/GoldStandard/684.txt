<h>Introduction
<p>Recent research on the role of practice variables during the
   acquisition of motor skills is reviewed. These practice variables
   include (a) the effects of a model's skill level during observation,
   (b) how augmented feedback is provided two a learner and (c) how
   practice conditions are arranged when learning multiple tasks. The
   results of research in these areas suggest that cognitive processes
   play an important role during the early stages of skill acquisition.
   Moreover, the effort by which these cognitive processes are undertaken
   is influenced by practice variables. Motor learning is enhanced when
   these variables are manipulated to promote cognitive effort by a
   learner.

<p>Despite their best intentions, people sometimes tend to be lazy
   thinkers during practice. For instance, hitting a bucket of golf balls
   at the driving range can be monotonous. At times, the swing seems to
   go into "autopilot" - the mind takes a short test, and individuals
   tend to repeat previously determined goals without giving the swing
   pattern much planning. On some days, much of the practice seems to be
   conducted on autopilot. What are the consequences of this type of
   practice?

<p>Early theoretical views of motor learning suggested that the motor
   commands and the sensory feedback that resulted from the movement were
   all that needed to be stored in memory for learning to occur. By this
   view, thinking was not too important for purposes or motor learning.
   More recent views stress the role of cognition in motor skills. In
   general, cognition refers to a collective group of thought processes.
   The hockey goalie tries to predict the direction of a shot by
   searching for perceptual clues that provide advance information. The
   golfer without a clear shot to the green tries to remember how to hit
   a controlled fade. The figure skater about to perform a triple axle
   jump followed immediately by a triple toe loop must prepare for this
   combined action with the flexibility in mind to change the plan if
   something goes wrong. All of these are examples of decision- making
   processes regarding the anticipation, planning, regulation and
   interpretation of motor performance.

<p>Accepting that cognition plays an important function in performing
   motor skills, the question of the role of cognition during practice
   takes on more importance. Motor learning involves more than storing
   sensory and motor information that arises as a consequence of
   movement. Skill is highly cognitive, and the cognitive processes that
   subserve movement must be practiced as well. Our goal in this paper is
   to highlight some selected issues of major learning research that
   illustrate the importance of cognitive processes during practice.

<p>In this paper we present the differences that arise as a consequence
   of different practice conditions in terms of cognitive effort. In
   general, cognitive effort refers to the mental work involved in making
   decisions. In some cases, practice conditions result in more intense
   use of processing resources. In other cases research suggests that
   different types of decision-making processes are affected by practice
   conditions. Using cognitive effort as a focal point, one can view
   practice as an opportunity to either promote or impede the
   decision-making processes that underscore movement.

<p>In this paper, we develop the concept of cognitive effort from
   research on three distinct areas or motor learning research. First, we
   review some recent findings from research on modeling that watching an
   unskilled model learn a motor skill can benefit the observer by
   providing a vicarious opportunity to join the problem-solving process.
   This section is followed by a review of some findings that augmented
   feedback can sometimes be presented in such a way as to be detrimental
   to learning. The final area of research suggests that, while
   drill-type practice conditions can facilitate improvements during
   practice, such conditions also result in poor retention and transfer.
   Collectively, these three areas of research suggest that learning is
   promoted when the practice conditions promote cognitive effort

<h>Model Skill Level and Observational Learning
<p>Demonstrating a motor skill to class of students is one of the
   fundamental tools in teaching. Despite a strong research base that
   supports the use of models, there are many instance in which the
   characteristics of the model determine its potential usefulness. For
   instance, few would challenge the assumption that experts in a motor
   skill make good models for the purposes of demonstration. But are
   experts always the best models to use?

<p>Early theoretical support for the use of expert models was offered by
   Sheffield. According to his view, symbolic behavior could be coded and
   modeled by means of a perceptual blueprint, a precise representation
   of the perceptual demands or the task, The purpose of the blueprint
   was to serve both as a representation of what to do and as a referent
   for making corrections. Observation provided a means by which the
   perceptual blueprint could be acquired, and Sheffield's theory
   provided a rationale for the use of experts as optimal models.

<p>The use of expert models also has considerable pedagogical support, as
   one may discover from a visit to the sports instruction section of a
   video store

<p>These tapes (on sports such as, golf tennis, skiing, bowling, etc.)
   often feature a repetitive view of top-level athletes demonstrating a
   particular motor skill- But, are these types of video useful? There
   are both theoretical and empirical reasons to be skeptical.

<p>In 1984, the United States National Academy of Sciences was asked by
   Army Research Institute to form a committee to investigate the value
   of various instructional techniques. One of the techniques
   investigated was a series of tapes known as SyberVision. The use of
   expert models from which to learn sport skills such as tennis, golf,
   or bowling was justified by their "neuromuscular programming" theory.
   According to the documentation provided by SyberVision, "the more you
   see and hear pure movement, the deeper it becomes imprinted in your
   nervous system ... and the more likely you are to perform it as a
   conditioned reflex". However, the committee found no specific evidence
   that supported these claims.

<p>These conclusions, should not be all that surprising. The use of
   experts as models appears to encourage more the process of imitation
   than true learning through observation. When watching these videos,
   the observer is encouraged to mimic what the model has demonstrated.
   Bandura, a pioneer in the field of social modeling, discredits
   imitation as a method that minimizes the power of modeling. In his
   words, "modeling imparts conceptions and rules for generating variant
   forms of behavior to suit different purposes and circumstances. In
   skill acquisition, modeling is more accurately represented as rule
   learning than as response mimicry".

<p>The repetitious nature of the skills demonstrated by experts in these
   videos also appears to imply that repeated exposure to a desirable
   performance will "stamp in" a representation of consistent, errorless
   performance. This assumption, however, appears to ignore the fact that
   errorless practice and role repetition are poor learning strategies.

<p>Although research suggests that observational learning does occur
   using expert models, the findings suggest that a novice who is
   learning a motor skill can also be an effective model. Although most
   of this research is recent, it was anticipated many years ago by
   Twitmyer. He compared two groups of objects who learned to trace a
   pencil maze while blindfolded. Subjects in one group (the learning
   models), practiced the task on two different days. During his time,
   subjects in is second group (the observers) watched and recorded (he
   results of the learning models. These observers then performed the
   task on a third day. Since the learning models performed without
   previous observation of a model, their results were used as control
   data. The performance of the observers was better than the models'
   performance on the very first trial, and remained better throughout
   the learning session.

<p>Although Twitmyer may have done the first study using unskilled models
   in an observation experiment, a study by Adams  has sparked the recent
   search efforts. Similar to the Twitmyer method, a model practiced in
   the presence of an observer, after which the observer practiced the
   task. In Adams' study, the model practiced a movement timing task for
   50 trials and observed under one of two conditions. The two groups of
   observers differed in terms the augmented feedback provided while
   observing: one group received the movement time augmented feedback
   that was delivered to the model whereas the other group did not
   receive this additional information (this feedback was crucial for the
   model to learn the task). Adams found that the observers performed
   better than the models, with the best performance achieved by the
   observers who also received the models' augmented feedback.

<p>But how effective is a learning model when directly compared to an
   expert model? A few studies have made this comparison, but the results
   are mixed.

<p>Experiments by Weir and Leavitt and by Pollock and Lee found no
   differences due to the performance level of the model. For example, in
   the Pollock and Lee study, subjects watched a model perform 15 trials
   on a computer game that required pursuit tracking. The benefit due to
   previous observation was evident on the first post-observational
   trial, and this benefit remained throughout practise. There was no
   difference due to the model's skill level.

<p>However, a study by McCullagh and Caird did find that performance
   after watching a learning model was better than after watching an
   expert model. McCullagh and Cairds's task was similar to the task used
   by Adams. Subjects conducted a series of six acquisition blocks. Each
   block included watching five performances of a model, followed by five
   performance trials. The different observation groups watched either an
   expert model or a learning model. While watching the learning model,
   groups of observers either received the model's augmented feedback
   after each attempt or did not receive the feedback (similar to Adam's
   method).

<p>The findings of the observers' performance trials during acquisition,
   an immediate retention test, a retention test 1 day later, and a
   delayed transfer test (to a novel timing goal) are clear. Observation
   of the learning model while also receiving the model's augmented
   feedback resulted in the best observational learning.

<p>While studies comparing the value of expert versus learning models in
   acquiring sport skills has begun, we can conjecture that at a minimum,
   observing a learning model will be no less effective than observing an
   expert model. In some circumstances, it may even be more effective.
   The skill level of the model has an impact on the observer's cognitive
   effort to learn from the motor behavior that was demonstrated. An
   expert model provides a precise representation of how a skilled action
   should be performed. However, a learning model more actively engages
   the observer in the problem solving processes that characterize
   learning. The observer can clearly observe the movement behavior of
   the model and the success of the model's subsequent attempts to reduce
   performance error. Indeed, observers have reported to us that it was
   difficult to suppress making comments to a live, learning model when
   the model failed to make an obvious correction of a movement behavior.
   On implication of this finding is that observing the possible errors
   that can be made on a task and the success of various attempts to
   solve these errors provides a conceptual insight into the cognitive
   basis of the task to be learned. Such a process seems well suited to
   the skill observation process.

<h>The Guiding Influence of Augmented Feedback
<p>Augmented feedback refers to information that a learner does not
   normally receive directly from the senses. For example, a tennis
   player will know that the serve was not good because the ball hit the
   net. However, the exact reason for this result my not be obvious.
   Augmented feedback refers to making explicit something that might be
   difficult, if not impossible, to know implicitly. Usually this
   information is augmented by a teacher or coach using verbal statements
   or by means of visual aids. In this way, the information is "fed back"
   to the learner.

<p>For years, researchers and educators seemed content with the following
   general view on the role of augmented feedback in motor learning: The
   use of augmented feedback is most effective whenever it is provided as
   soon after performance as possible, as often as possible, and in such
   a way as to reduce performance errors as efficiently as possible. That
   view was challenged at few years ago by Richard Schmidt and his
   colleagues.

<p>Schmidt made some rather startling conclusions after reexamining some
   previously published experiments and conducting new studies. The first
   conclusion was that the general view on augmented feedback given above
   was based largely on data gathered during practice. Schmidt argued
   that this was weak methodology since changes during practice reflected
   temporary influences on performance and not always true learning
   effects. A better assessment of learning was provided by retention and
   transfer tests after temporary effects no longer exerted an influence
   on performance. The second conclusion was that if the augmented
   feedback literature was re-evaluated using retention and transfer
   data, the evidence pointed to a view that was quite different from the
   prevailing view. We begin by considering some of the augmented
   feedback variables and their effects on learning, then describe
   Schmidt's ideas about the guiding role of augmented feedback on motor
   learning.

<h>Error Estimation and Temporal Delay
<p>One view for optimizing the benefits of augmented feedback was to
   present the feedback as soon after movement as possible. Findings
   indicated a different interpretation. In these studies, augmented
   feedback was provided either instantaneously with the completion of a
   movement or after an 8-second delay. Subjects that received this short
   delay during practice either sat silently during the interval or
   attempted to estimate the magnitude of the augmented feedback that
   they were about to receive. Learning was assessed when subjects again
   performed the task 10 minutes and 2 days after the practice period.
   All groups performed without augmented feedback during these retention
   tests.

<p>There was little difference between the groups during the practice
   (acquisition) period. However, a pattern of results began to emerge
   after 10 minutes that was further clarified on the 2-day retention
   test. This pattern of results indicated (a) relatively good retention
   following practice in which estimation of the augmented feedback was
   made during the delay period and (b) relatively poor results for the
   group that was given instantaneous augmented feedback. The delayed
   group performed at an intermediate level. These findings not only
   argued against the prevailing view of providing feedback as soon as
   possible after a movement but suggested that, in fact, such a
   procedure could be detrimental to learning. Moreover, the results
   suggested that estimating the magnitude of the error prior to
   receiving the augmented feedback had an additional benefit to learning
   beyond that of simply delaying the feedback.

<h>Summary Feedback
<p>Summary feedback is related to the temporal delay of feedback
   discussed above. In this method, feedback is delayed until after a
   series of trials have been completed; feedback is then provided in a
   manner that summarizes the receding trialsAn experiment by Schmidt,
   Young, Shapiro and Swinnen illustrates the effects of summary feedback

<p>Subjects in this study were divided into four groups according to the
   number of trials that were summarized on a graph and presented to the
   subject as augmented feedback. In the "Sum 1" group, feedback was
   provided after every trial. In the "Sum 5", "Sum 10" and "Sum 15"
   groups, feedback was provided on a graph about the 5, 10 or 15
   preceding trials, illustrating how performance either changed or
   remained consistent over trials. Immediate and delayed teas of
   retention followed the practice period.

<p>Two sets of findings are important. First acquisition performance was
   negatively related to size of the summary; the larger the summary the
   poorer the acquisition performance. Second, delayed retention
   performance was achieved by the "Sum 15" and "Sum 10" groups, and the
   worst performance by the "Sum 5" and "Sum 1" groups. These findings
   are particularly interesting because or the opposite effects that the
   summary conditions had on the practice performance and on learning and
   because of the direct findings to teaching sport skills.

<h>Relative Frequency
<p>The frequency of providing augmented feedback was another of the
   prevailing views that was challenged by Schmidt. The belief was that
   the absolute frequency of augmented feedback (i.e. the number of times
   that feedback was provided) was a critical variable in learning, but
   that relative frequency (the ratio of feedback-provided trials to the
   total number of trials) was not an important variable for learning.
   However, much of the evidence to support this view was based on data
   from the practice period rather than from retention tests. In their
   review of this literature, Salmoni et all. (1984) found a few studies
   that included retention tests following relative frequency
   manipulations. Surprisingly, these studies showed that relative
   frequency might indeed be an important variable in learning - that low
   relative frequencies might he better than high relative frequencies of
   augmented feedback. Subsequent studies have since confirmed these
   effects.

<p>An interesting corollary to the relative frequency effects has also
   emerged. Using a movement timing task, Sherwood provided subjects with
   augmented feedback only when their errors exceeded certain tolerance
   limits about the goal. For one group of subjects, augmented feedback
   was provided on every trial (a "0% bandwidth"). For other subjects,
   augmented feedback was provided only when performance error was
   greater than +/- 5%, or greater than +/- 10% of the goal. By this
   manipulation, Sherwood also influenced the frequency schedule by which
   augmented feedback was provided (since feedback was not provided for
   trials on which performance was within the bandwidth limits).

<p>Early in practice, when many errors occurred, the relative frequency
   of augmented feedback was fairly high. However, as performance
   improvements were made over practice, the relative frequency became
   less frequent. Performance on a retention test was best for the group
   that had received the 10% bandwidth and poorest for the 0% bandwidth
   group, with the 5% group performing at an intermediate level. At a
   minimum, these findings are consistent with the effects of reduced
   relative frequency, although it seems that the bandwidth manipulation
   has an additional learning effect. The other similarity is that
   "fading" the relative frequency of feedback over practice (giving
   frequent feedback early in practice and infrequently later) is both an
   effective strategy and one that occurs as a natural consequence of the
   bandwidth procedure.

<h>A Guidance Role for Augmented Feedback
<p>Collectively, these findings have been interpreted by Schmidt as
   evidence in support of a guidance role (or augmented feedback.
   Although augmented feedback can be useful under the right
   circumstances, providing augmented feedback can be detrimental to
   learning under other conditions. In general, these conditions occur
   (a) when augmented feedback is necessary for learning to occur and (b)
   when augmented feedback is presented such that it guides the learner
   toward certain corrective actions. In these cases, the learner becomes
   too reliant upon the augmented feedback to correct movement errors.
   For example, the provision of instantaneous feedback during practice
   tends to detract the learner from interpreting intrinsic sources of
   feedback, such as vision and proprioception. Schmidt suggests that it
   is these sources of feedback that one must learn to interpret since
   they will always be available to the learner. Augmented feedback (such
   as the feedback received from a teacher) will not always be available
   (e.g., during a game). Indeed, the goal in most learning situations is
   for the learner to become independent of the teacher. Learning to rely
   upon the information provided by these people will ultimately be
   detrimental to achieving independence.

<p>From a different perspective, the Swinnen showed that encouraging
   subjects to estimate their augmented feedback produced a benefit to
   learning beyond that achieved by simply delaying the instantaneous
   provision of the feedback. This suggests that the cognitive effort in
   attempting to learn to interpret one's own intrinsic feedback, in
   combination with augmented feedback, can be a potent influence on
   learning. Augmented feedback might be most beneficial to learning when
   it serves to augment the cognitive efforts in learning self-evaluation
   skills using the sources of information that will be available during
   competition.

<h>Contextual Interference
<p>Another intriguing research issue investigated in recent years is the
   contextual interference effect. This finding was first studied by Shea
   and Morgan and has been replicated many times since. In the Shea and
   Morgan study, two groups of subjects each learned these simple
   laboratory tasks. All aspects of the practice were identical with the
   exception of the order in which the tasks were practiced. Under the
   blocked order, all practice trials on one of the tasks were completed
   before another task was undertaken. This procedure is similar to
   practice "drills" because of the repetitive nature of the practice.

<p>In contrast, the other group practiced the tasks in a random order,
   such that they were switching from one task to another throughout
   practice. The random order resulted in considerably more interference
   between tasks compared to a blocked order. Thus, it was not too
   surprising that random practice resulted in much poorer acquisition
   performance than blocked practice.

<p>What was rather surprising were the results of these two groups on
   retention tests conducted minutes and days later. On both retention
   tests the random group performed better than the blocked group.

<p>These results resemble the findings of the summary experiment earlier,
   in which the same conditions that led to poor acquisition performance
   also led to very good retention. However, in the case of random and
   blocked practice orders, it was not the manipulation of augmented
   feedback but the interference arising from the order by which the
   tasks were practiced that produced the results. Hence, the cause for
   the contextual interference findings has been discussed in terms of
   different theoretical constraints than described for the augmented
   feedback findings.

<p>One account for the contextual interference effect is that random
   practice encourages a learner to compare and contrast the methods and
   strategies used for performing the different tasks. Switching between
   tasks during practice provides the learner with better contrastive
   knowledge than the drill, repetitive-type practice that occurs under a
   blocked order. This contrast between tasks makes learning each task
   more distinctive and memorable, resulting in the advantages seen later
   in retention.

<p>Another explanation for the contextual interference effect can best be
   described using an analogy. If you are asked to mentally multiply two
   numbers (e.g. 34 x 26=?), it would take some work, but could be done
   with effort. If the same question were asked a short time later, the
   answer could be given right away if the solution from the previous
   menial effort was still in working memory.

<p>If however, that answer had been forgotten, then the question would
   have to be solved again. Lee and Magill used a similar idea to explain
   the contextual interteretice effect. Random practice requires a
   learner to approach a task by developing a strategy or plan of action.
   However, such a plan is inappropriate to maintain in memory since the
   task on the next trial is different. Thus, a new plan of action needs
   to be developed. By the time the previous task is performed again, the
   plan that had been developed for it last time has been lost from
   memory, and a new plan of action must be developed. This process
   continues throughout random practice. In contrast, the same plan of
   action can be used again and again during blocked practice since the
   same task is practiced repeatedly. The consequence is that having
   learned to develop a plan of action when necessary (under random
   practice) makes the learning both more memorable and better suited for
   novel performance simulations.

<p>Both theoretical orientations to the contextual interference effect
   have received quite a bit of empirical attention. It is also
   interesting to note that there have been a number of experiments
   undertaken to examine the contextual interference effect in acquiring
   sport skills, and the findings appear to replicate the findings from
   laboratory experiments quite well. Practice and retention /transfer
   findings showing the "typical" blocked/random differences have been
   found for learning badminton serves and in rifle shooting.

<p>Most of the laboratory experiments and field tests of contextual
   interference effects have been conducted using subjects who were
   unskilled at the tasks to be learned. However, in a recent study.
   Hall, Domingues, and Cavazos found interesting contextual interference
   effects for athletes who had already achieved a high level of
   performance. In this study, college-level baseball players received
   two sessions of extra batting practice per week for 6 weeks. One group
   of subjects received 15 curve balls, 15 fast balls and 15 change-ups
   in a blocked order during each session. Another group of subjects
   received the same number and types of pitches in a random order. A
   control group of subjects received no extra batting practice. Scores
   (in terms of the number of solid hits) were recorded on a random
   pretest, on two practice sessions (Sessions 5 and 8), and on both a
   randomly ordered and a blocked ordered transfer test.

<p>Several points of interest from the Hall study are notable. First, the
   extra batting practice improved performance as noted by the better
   performance on the transfer tests by both the random and blocked
   groups, compared to the control group. Second, performance during the
   practice sessions was generally better by the blocked group than for
   the random group. Third, transfer performance was better for the
   random practice group than for the blocked practice group, regardless
   of the order in which the transfer trials were conducted. The most
   exciting aspect of these results however, was that this "typical"
   contextual interference effect was found for subjects who had
   previously achieved a high level of performance on the criterion task.

<h>Cognitive Effort
<p>The three areas of research discussed above provide rather diverse
   examples of cognitive effort in motor skill learning. In each area of
   research we have provided examples that illustrate how conditions of
   practice either promoted or diminished the decision-making activities
   of the subject learning a motor skill.

<p>Some instructors feel that watching the expert execute the same sport
   skill time and again, with flawless precision, should engender some
   type of passive diffusion of that knowledge into the observer. The
   advantages seen by observing a learning model suggest an advantage
   gained through a rather different process. In this case, the observer
   is watching the model attempt a performance. If the observer is also
   able to receive some feedback about the success of that performance,
   then the observer is in the position to judge, independent of the
   model, what would be appropriate to do next. In short, the observer
   becomes actively involved, albeit vicariously, in the process of
   learning. The observer joins the learning model in the trial-and-error
   process.

<p>Augmented feedback is a means of supplementing the sources of feedback
   normally available to an individual. As a source of information that
   complements the always present sources, augmented feedback serves a
   restrictive role. Optimally, augmented feedback should be used to help
   a person to interpret the sources of feedback that are always
   available. Augmented feedback should provide a knowledge referent, or
   "reliability check," to insure that intrinsic sources of feedback are
   correctly being interpreted. For example, the reasons for an errant
   golf shot are often available from watching the flight of the ball.
   How to interpret this intrinsic feedback, however, is something that
   must be learned. The optimal role of augmented feedback is to assist
   the learner to correctly interpret this intrinsic feedback.

<p>For augmented feedback to serve its most useful role, it must be given
   in such a way that it helps without discouraging the performer from
   learning to interpret intrinsic feedback. Learning to interpret one's
   own intrinsic feedback requires cognitive effort. However, that
   learning can he weakened if the augmented feedback serves a role in
   which it undermines the effort to learn to interpret one's own
   intrinsic feedback. There is no need for the learner to try to
   interpret the intrinsic feedback when augmented feedback is provided
   instantaneously upon movement completion and when it follows every
   trial. In a way, cognitive effort is suppressed, yet performance
   improves quite well without it. Encouraging the interpretation of
   performance, reducing the relative frequency (combined with
   performance bandwidths), and increasing the summary sizes of augmented
   feedback all positively impact the cognitive effort to interpret
   intrinsic sources of information.

<p>Practice drills are good procedures for learning skills. However, many
   motor skills that are undertaken daily do not involve repetitive
   actions. This problem became clear recently when one of us was
   teaching a boy how to tie his shoes. The thought processes that he
   undertook in tying his shoes were clearly evident by the slow and
   deliberate actions of his fingers as work. These were repeated on the
   next shoe, but to a far less degree. We wonder what would have
   happened if he had been asked to keep practicing for 15 minutes. No
   doubt, success would have come more quickly and easily. However, would
   success have been achieved any easier the next morning? Evidence
   regarding the contextual interference effect suggests not.

<p>Solving a problem by recalling a recent solution bypasses the
   cognitive effort involved in the decision-making process. When a task
   requires that these decisions be learned, conditions should be
   arranged such that these decisions are practiced. Arranging practice
   conditions that serve to avoid this cognitive effort hinders the
   learning process.

<p>Learning motor skills involves also learning cognitive skills. We have
   provided three instances of research that collectively suggest that
   the cognitive effort expected during practice has a critical impact on
   the learning process. The functional independence of students and
   athletes lies in their ability to think and act on their own.
   Promoting that purpose in practice and training sessions is compatible
   with that goal.

<h>A Caveat for Instructors
<p>An interesting question was recently posed by Robert Bjork: "if the
   research picture is so clear, then why are massed practice, excessive
   feedback, fixed conditions of training and limited opportunities for
   retrieval practice - among other non-productive manipulations - such
   common features of real world training conditions?". There are several
   answers to the question. One could be that the research picture is not
   all that clear. In this paper we have built an argument for the role
   of cognitive effort in learning motor skills based on a limited set of
   data. The generalizability of these ideas await further research.

<p>If the research picture is accurate however, then Bjork argues that
   nonproductive training manipulations continue to be used for as least
   two further reasons. One relates to the performance / learning
   distinction. Some of the temporary benefits to performance seen during
   practice favored the use of practice manipulations that actually
   resulted in poor retention One example is contextual interference. If
   an instructor were to value a practice manipulation in terms of how
   quickly a standard of performance was achieved then blocked training
   would be seen as a much better arrangement of practice orders than
   random training. However, an appreciation for the assessment of
   learning in terms of retention and transfer would produce the opposite
   conclusion. Related to this same issue is the fact that instructors of
   training programs may only he involved with the learner for the period
   of time during which the practice occurs. Perhaps they are satisfied
   with the benefits to performance seen by their training methods, or
   perhaps they are not aware of the impact their training regimes have
   on longer term retention or transfer after their involvement with the
   learner has been completed.

<p>The second reason given by Bjork for the continued use of
   nonproductive training conditions is due to the subjective experiences
   of the learner. Rapid improvements on a motor skill are reassuring,
   and the learner may develop illusions about time progress made on a
   skill as a result of conditions of practice that favor rapid,
