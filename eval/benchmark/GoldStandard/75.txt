   equivalent to a decision within the meaning of the General
   Administrative Regulations Act (Algemene wet bestuursrecht). This

   down by Section 3.4 of that Act. The decision must be taken within a
   reasonable period of time, it being understood that this period must
   be no longer than thirteen weeks.
 <p>   5. The declaration shall apply for the duration of the code of
   conduct, while not exceeding five years from the date on which the
   declaration is announced. Where a declaration is requested for an
   amendment to a code of conduct for which a declaration has already
   been issued previously, the declaration shall apply for the duration
   of the declaration issued previously.

   together with the associated code, in the Official Gazette
   (Staatscourant).

   (1)(b) to (f) shall be notified in each case within one year of the
   previous notification, where they appear to be of more than incidental
   importance.
<p>   4. Any processing which departs from that which has been notified in
   accordance with the provisions of (1)(b) to (f) shall be recorded and
   kept for at least three years.
 <p>  5. More detailed rules can be issued by or under general
   administrative regulation concerning the procedure for submitting
   notifications.

 <h>  Article 29

 <p>  1. It may be laid down by general administrative regulation that
   certain categories of data processing which are unlikely to infringe
   the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, are exempted
   from the notification requirement referred to in Article 27.
<p>   2. In this case, the following particulars shall be stated:

  <l>   the purposes of the processing,

  <l>   the processed data or categories of processed data,

  <l>   the categories of data subjects,

 <l>    the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data is to be
   supplied, and

     the period during which the data are to be stored.
  <p> 3. Where this is necessary in order to detect criminal offences in a
   particular case, it may be laid down by general administrative
   regulation that certain categories of processing by responsible
   parties who are vested with investigating powers by law shall be
   exempt from notification. Compensatory guarantees to protect personal
   data can be provided in this connection. The processed data may only
   be used for the purposes expressly stated in the said general
   administrative regulation.
 <p>  4. The notification requirement does not apply to public registers set
   up by law or to data supplied to an administrative body pursuant to a
   legal obligation.

  <h> Article 30

<p>   1. Both the Data Protection Commssion and the officer shall maintain
   an up-to-date register of the data processing notified to them. The
   register shall contain as a minimum the information provided in
   accordance with Article 28(l)(a) to (e).
<p>   2. The register may be consulted by any person free of charge.
 <p>  3. The responsible party shall provide any person who so requests with
   the information referred to in Article 28(l)(a) to (e) concerning data
   processing exempted from the notification requirement.
<p>   4. The provisions of (3) do not apply to:
 <l>  a. data processing which is covered by an exemption under Article
   29(3).
 <l>  b. public registers set up by law.

 <h>  Section 2. Prior investigation

 <h>  Article 31

 <p>  1. The Data Protection Commission shall initiate an investigation
   prior to any processing for which responsible parties:
<l>   a. plan to process a number identifying persons for a purpose other
   than the one for which the number is specifically intended with the
   aim of linking the data together with data processed by other
   responsible parties, unless the number is used for the cases defined
   in Article 24;
<l>   b. plan to record data on the basis of their own observations without
   informing the data subjects thereof, or
<l>   c. plan to process data on criminal behaviour or on unlawful or
   objectionable conduct for third parties other than under the terms of
   a licence issued under the Private Security Organisations and
   Investigation Bureaus Act.
 <p>  2. The provisions of (1)(b) do not apply to public registers set up by
   law.
 <p>  3. The provisions of (1) may be rendered applicable to other types of
   data processing by law or general administrative regulation where such
   processing carries a particular risk for the individual rights and
   freedoms of the data subject. The Data Protection Commission shall
   indicate in its annual report the extent to which, in its opinion, the
   said provisions should be rendered applicable to such data.
  <p> 4. The Data Protection Commission shall notify processing referred to
   under (1)(c) to the European Commission.

 <h>  Article 32

 <p>  1. Data processing to which Article 31(1) is applicable shall be
   notified as such by the responsible party to the Data Protection
   Commssion.
 <p>  2. The notification of such data processing requires responsible
   parties to suspend the processing they are planning to carry out until
   the Commission has completed its investigation or until they have
   received notice that a more detailed investigation will not be
   conducted.
<p>   3. In the case of the notification of data processing to which Article
   31(1) is applicable, the Commission shall communicate its decision in
   writing within four weeks of the notification as to whether or not it
   will conduct a more detailed investigation.
 <p>  4. In the event that the Commission decides to conduct a more detailed
   investigation, it shall indicate the period of time within which it
   plans to conduct this investigation. This period must not exceed
   thirteen weeks.
<p>   5. The more detailed investigation referred to under (4) leads to a
   statement concerning the lawfulness of the data processing.
<p>   6. The statement by the Commission is deemed to be equivalent to a
   decision within the meaning of the General Administrative Regulations
   Act. This statement shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure
   laid down by Section 3.4 of that Act.

 <h> CHAPTER 5. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE DATA SUBJECT

<h>   Article 33

<p>   1. Where personal data are to be obtained from a data subject, the
   responsible party shall provide the data subject with the information
   referred to under (2) and (3) prior to obtaining the said personal
   data, unless the data subject is already acquainted with this
   information.
 <p>  2. The responsible party shall inform the data subject of its identity
   and the purposes of the processing for which the data are intended.
 <p>  3. The responsible party shall provide more detailed information,
   where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they are to
   be obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in order
   to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the processing is
   carried out in a proper and careful manner.

 <h>  Article 34

 <p>  1. Where personal data are obtained in a manner other than that
   referred to in Article 33, the responsible party shall provide the
   data subject with the information referred to under (2) and (3),
   unless the data subject is already acquainted with this information:
   a. at the time that the data relating to him is recorded; or
   b. when it is intended to supply the data to a third party, at the
   latest on the first occasion that the said data are so supplied.
<p>   2. The responsible party shall inform the data subject of its identity
   and the purposes of the processing.
<p>   3. The responsible party shall provide more detailed information,
   where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they have
   been obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in
   order to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the
   processing is carried out in a proper and careful manner.
 <p>  4. The provisions of (1) do not apply if it appears to be impossible
   or would involve a disproportionate effort to provide the said
   information to the data subject. In that case, the responsible party
   shall record the origin of the data.
 <p>  5. The provisions of (1) likewise do not apply if the recording or
   provision of the data is required by or under the law. In that case,
   the responsible party must inform the data subject, upon his request,
   about the legal provision which led to the recording or supply of data
   relating to the data subject.

 <h>  CHAPTER 6. RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT

 <h>  Article 35

 <p>  1. A data subject has the right, freely and at reasonable intervals,
   to request the responsible party to inform him as to whether personal
   data relating to him are being processed. The responsible party shall
   inform the data subject in writing within four weeks as to whether
   personal data relating to him are being processed.
<p>   2. In the event that such data are being processed, the information
   provided shall contain a full and clear summary thereof, a definition
   of the purpose or purposes of the processing, the data categories to
   which the processing relates and the recipients or categories of
   recipients, as well as the available information about the origin of
   the data.
<p>   3. Prior to the providing of information referred to under (1) to
   which a third party may be expected to object, the responsible party
   shall give the third party an opportunity to express its views where
   such information contains data concerning that third party unless this
   appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort.
   4. Upon request, the responsible party shall provide information
   concerning the underlying logic of the automated processing of data
   relating to the data subject.

 <h>  Article 36

 <p>  1. A person who has been informed about personal data relating to him
   in accordance with Article 35 may request the responsible party to
   correct, supplement, delete or block the said data in the event that
   it is factually inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant to the purpose or
   purposes of the processing, or is being processed in any other way
   which infringes a legal provision. The request shall contain the
   modifications to be made.
 <p>  2. The responsible party shall inform the requester in writing within
   four weeks of receiving the request as to whether and, if so, to what
   extent, it is complying therewith. A refusal to do so must be
   accompanied by the reasons.
 <p>  3. The responsible party must make sure that a decision to correct,
   supplement, delete or block data is implemented as quickly as
   possible.
 <p>  4. Where personal data have been recorded on a data carrier to which
   no modifications can be made, the responsible party must take the
   necessary steps to inform the data user that it is impossible to
   correct, supplement, delete or block the data, even where there are
   grounds under this article for modifying the data.
<p>   5. The provisions of (1) to (4) do not apply to public registers set
   up by law where this law provides for a special procedure for
   correcting, supplementing, deleting or blocking data.

 <h>  Article 37

<p>   1. Where an important interest of the requester so requires, the
   responsible party shall reply to the request referred to in Articles
   35 and 36 in a form, other than in writing, which takes due account of
   this interest.
<p>   2. The responsible party shall make sure that the identity of the
   requester is properly established.
<p>   3. In the case of minors who have not yet reached the age of sixteen,
   and of persons placed under legal restraint, the requests referred to
   in Articles 35 and 36 shall be made by their legal representatives.
   The information concerned shall also be provided to the legal
   representatives.

 <h>  Article 38

<p>   1. The responsible party who has corrected, supplemented, deleted or
   blocked personal data in response to a request under Article 36, has
   an obligation as soon as possible to inform third parties to whom the
   data has previously been supplied about the correction, addition,
   deletion or blocking, unless this appears to be impossible or would
   involve a disproportionate effort.
 <p>  2. Upon request, the responsible party shall notify the requester
   referred to in Article 36 of those parties to whom it has provided
   such information.

 <h>  Article 39

 <p>  1. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred
   in providing the information referred to in Article 35, the amount of
   which shall be laid down by or under general administrative regulation
   and may not exceed ten Dutch guilder.
<p>   2. The payment shall be refunded in the event that the responsible
   party corrects, supplements, deletes or blockes data at the request of
   the data subject, on the recommendation of the Data Protection
   Commission or by order of a court.
<p>   3. The amount referred to under (1) may be modified in special cases
   by general administrative regulation.

<h>   Article 40

   8(e) and (f), the data subject may at any time register an objection
   with the responsible party in connection with his particular personal
   circumstances.
 <p>  2. The responsible party shall take a decision within four weeks of
   receiving a notice of objection as to whether the objection is
   justified. In the event that the objection is justified, the
   responsible party shall stop the processing with immediate effect.
 <p>  3. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred
   in dealing with an objection, which payment may not exceed an amount
   to be laid down by or under a general administrative regulation. The
   payment shall be refunded in the event that the objection is found to
   be justified.
<p>   4. This article does not apply to public registers set up by law.

<h>   Article 41

 <p>  1. Where data are being processed in connection with the creation or
   maintenance of a direct relationship between the responsible party or
   a third party and the data subject with a view to recruitment for
   commercial or charitable purposes, the data subject may register an
   objection to such processing with the responsible party at any time
   and at no cost to himself.
 <p>  2. In the case of an objection, the responsible party shall take the
   steps required to stop this form of processing with immediate effect.
<p>   3. Responsible parties, who are planning to provide personal data to
   third parties or to use such data at their account for the purposes
   referred to under (1), shall take appropriate steps to notify the data
   subjects of the possibility of registering objections. This
   notification shall be made via one or more newspapers or free-sheets,
   or in some other suitable way. In the case of regular provision to or
   use at the account of third parties, the notification shall take place
   at least once a year.
<p>   4. Responsible parties processing personal data for the purposes
   referred to under (1), shall make sure that data subjects are notified
   of the possibility of registering objections, whenever a direct
   message is sent to them for the said purposes.

 <h>  Article 42

<p>   1. No one may be subject to a decision to which are attached legal
   consequences for them, or which affects them to a substantial degree,
   where this decision has been taken solely on the basis of the
   automated processing of personal data intended to provide a picture of
   certain aspects of their personality.
<p>   2. The provisions of (1) do not apply where the decision referred to
   therein:
 <l>  a. has been taken in connection with the conclusion or execution of a
   contract, and
 <l>  1. the request of the data subjects has been met, or
 <l>  2. appropriate measures have been taken to protect their legitimate
   interests; or
   b. is based on a law in which measures are laid down for protecting
   the legitimate interests of data subjects.
 <p>  3. Appropriate measures, as referred to under (2)(a), shall be
   considered as taken where the data subjects have been given the
   opportunity to put forward their views on the decisions as referred to
   under (1).
 <p>  4. In the case referred to under (2), the responsible party shall
   inform the data subjects about the underlying logic of the automated
   processing of the data relating to them.

 <h>  Article 43

<p>   Responsible parties are not required to apply Articles 9(1), 30(3),
   33, 34 and 35, where this is necessary in the interests of:

<l>   c. important economic and financial interests of the State and other
   public bodies;
 <l>  d. supervising compliance with legal provisions established in the
   interests referred to under (b) and (c), or
 <l> e. protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of other
   persons.

 <h>  Article 44

 <p>  1. Where processing is carried out by institutions or services for the

   Article 34 and may refuse to comply with the requests referred to in
   Article 35.
<p>  2. Where personal data are being processed which form part of archive
   records transferred to an archive storage place under Articles 12 or

   shall not be required to provide the information referred to in
   Article 34.

 <h>  CHAPTER 8. LEGAL PROTECTION

 <h>  Article 45

 <p>  A decision taken in response to a request referred to in Articles
   30(3), 35, 36 and 38(2), and a decision taken in response to the
   registering of an objection referred to in Articles 40 or 41, shall be
   equivalent to a decision within the meaning of the General
   Administrative Regulations Act, where this decision has been taken by
   an administrative body.

<h>   Article 46

 <p>  1. Where a decision referred to in Article 45 has been taken by a body
   other than an administrative body, the party concerned can apply to
   the district court with a written request to order the responsible
   party to grant or reject a request referred to in Articles 30(3), 35,
   36 or 38(2), or to recognise or reject an objection referred to in
   Articles 40 or 41.
<p>   2. The application must be submitted within six weeks of receiving the
   reply from the responsible party. In the event that the responsible
   party does not reply within the time limit, the application must be
   submitted within six weeks of the expiry of this time limit.
<p>  3. The court shall find in favour of the request where it is ruled to
   be well-founded. Before handing down a ruling, the court shall, where
   necessary, give the parties concerned an opportunity to put forward
   their views.
 <p>  4. The twelfth title of the First Book of the Code of Civil Procedure,
   with the exception of Article 429d(3), applies. Article 345 of the
   said Code does not apply.
 <p>  5. The third section of the fifth title of the Second Book of the Code
   of Civil Procedure is likewise applicable.

 <h>  Article 47

 <p>  1. Within the time limit provided for an appeal based on the General
   Administrative Regulations Act or referred to in Article 46(2), the
   party concerned may apply to the Data Protection Commission with a
   request to mediate or give its opinion in the dispute with the
   responsible party, or make use of the provisions concerning the
   arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the
   subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1). In that
   case, notwithstanding Article 6:7 of the General Administrative
   Regulations Act, the appeal may still be lodged or the court
   proceedings provided for in Article 46 still initiated after the party
   concerned has received notice from the Data Protection Commission, or
   further to the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a
   code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as
   referred to in Article 25(1), that the case has been dealt with, but
   at the latest six weeks after that moment.
<p>   2. During the period when the appeal and the proceedings referred to
   under (1) are being dealt with, the bodies responsible for dealing
   with the dispute may obtain the opinion of the Data Protection
   Commission.

<h>   Article 48

 <p>  The bodies responsible for dealing with the dispute shall send a copy
   of their verdict to the Data Protection Commission.

 <h>  Article 49

   him which infringe the provisions laid down by or under this Act, the
   following paragraphs shall apply, without prejudice to other legal
   provisions.
 <p>  2. For harm that does not comprise damage to property, the injured
   party has the right to fair compensation.
 <p>  3. Responsible parties are liable for harm resulting from
   non-compliance with the provisions referred to under (1). Processors
   are liable for this harm where this was incurred as a result of their
   actions.
 <p>  4. Responsible parties or processors may be exempted wholly or
   partially from this liability where they can prove that the harm
   cannot be attributed to them.

<h>   Article 50

 <p>  1. Where responsible parties or processors act in contravention of the
   provisions laid down by or under this Act and other parties sustain,
   or may sustain, harm as a consequence thereof, the courts may, at the
   petition of the other parties, impose a ban on such conduct and order
   them to take measures to remedy the consequences of that conduct.
 <p>  2. Processing cannot form the basis for a claim by a legal person
   referred to in Article 1:2(3) of the General Administrative
   Regulations Act or Article 3:305a of the Civil Code, where the persons
   affected by this processing object thereto.

   mixing of the supervisory, advisory and enforcement tasks of the
   Commission. They may also give more detailed provisions for the

   obtained the information from third parties on condition that it is
   kept confidential.

 <h>  Article 60

<p>   1. The Commission, acting in an official capacity or at the request of
   an interested party, may initiate an investigation into the manner in

   implementation of any law.
 <p>  3. In the case of an investigation initiated at the request of an
   interested party, the Commission shall inform the said party of its
   findings, unless providing such information would be incompatible with
   the purpose of the data processing or the nature of the personal data,
   or unless important interests of parties other than the requester,

 <h>  Article 68

 <p>  Responsible parties in respect of whom acts have been carried out for

   of the powers of the Commission to impose fines.

<h>   Article 76

<p>   1. Personal data which are subject to processing or intended for
   processing after they have been transferred, shall only be transferred
   to a country outside the European Union in the case that, without
   prejudice to compliance with the provisions of this Act, that country
   guarantees an adequate level of protection.
 <p>  2. An assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection shall take
   account of the circumstances affecting a data transfer operation or a
   category of data tranfer operations. Account shall be taken in
   particular of the type of data, the purpose or purposes and the
   duration of the planned processing or processing operations, the
   country of origin and country of final destination, the general and
   sectoral legal provisions applying in the non-member country
   concerned, as well as the rules governing the business sector and
   security rules applying in these countries.

 <h>  Article 77

 <p>  1 . Notwithstanding Article 76, an operation or category of operations
   to transfer personal data to a non-member country which does not
   provide guarantees for an adequate level of protection may take place,
   provided that:
  <l> a. the data subjects have unambiguously given their consent thereto,
  <l> b. the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between
   the data subjects and the responsible parties, or for actions to be
   carried out at the request of the data subjects and which are
   necessary for the conclusion of a contract;
  <l> c. the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a
   contract concluded or to be concluded between responsible parties and
   third parties in the interests of data subjects;
  <l> d. the transfer is necessary on account of an important public
   interest, or for the establishment, exercise or defence in law of any
   right;
  <l> e. the transfer is necessary to protect a vital interest of data
   subjects, or
 <l>  f. the transfer is carried out from a public register set up by law or
   from a register which can be consulted by anyone or by any persons who
   can invoke a legitimate interest, provided that in the case concerned
   the legal requirements for consultation are met.
 <p>  2. Notwithstanding the provisions under (1), Our Minister, after
   consulting the Data Protection Commission, may issue a permit for a
   personal data transfer or category of transfers to a non-member
   country that does not provide guarantees for an adequate level of
   protection. Attaching to this permit are the more detailed rules
   required to protect the individual privacy and fundamental rights and
   freedoms of persons and to guarantee implementation of the associated
   rights.

  <h> Article 78

  <p>  1. Our Minister shall notify the Commission of the European
   Communities of:
  <l>  a. the cases in which, in his or her opinion, a non-member country
   does not provide guarantees for an adequate level of protection within
   the meaning of Article 76(l), and
 <l>  b. a permit, as referred to in Article 77(2).
  <p>  2. Where this follows from a decision of the Commission of the
   European Communities or the Council of the European Union, Our
   Minister shall lay down by ministerial ruling or by decision that:
 <l>    * the transfer to a country outside the European Union is
       prohibited;
 <l>    * a country outside the Union is considered to guarantee an adequate
       level of protection, or
 <l>    * a permit issued under Article 77(2) is withdrawn or modified.

  <p>  3. The notifications referred to under (1)(a) and (b) shall be
   published in the Official Gazette.

   the first sentence may be extended by general administrative
   regulation to a maximum of three years with respect to the
   notification requirement.

   performance of contracts made prior to the date of entry into force of
   this Act.
  <p>  3. Article 32(2) shall not apply to processing referred to in Article
