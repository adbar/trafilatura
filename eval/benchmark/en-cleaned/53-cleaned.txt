   <p>anyone else like to run multiple projects, or do you stay focused on
   one project at a time?

   <h>Calavaro

                       

    

   <p>More than 1 boxen on more than 1 project constitutes an addiction.
   Buying boxen or seeking out boxen to put a DC client on, would make
   you crazy in the common mans view.
   You, whilden, are just wired wrong. Wink

       

   <h>GOD

                       

   

   <p>I'm only running 3 projects - seti classic (still), mousetracker
   (useless but low cost) and folding @ home (actually useful).
   I'm only 60% as ill as whilden.

       

   <h>garo

   <l>Prime95
   <l>OGR
   <l>Seti Classic
   <l>DIMES
   <l>Proth (for generalized Fermat Numbers)
   <l>SOB Sieve
<p>These are only my current projects. In the past i've also run
   <l>G@H
   <l>RC5-64
   <l>Distr Folding
   <l>NSFNet
   <l>F@H
   <l>Ubero
   <l>CPDN (never completed a unit)

        

   <h>whilden

                           
   <p>I forgot about Dimes, which is like DC on top of DC.
   <p>/me calls the doc

        

   <h>MarcC

                        
   <p>hmm let's see at the moment:
   <l>Folding@home
   <l>DIMES
   <l>mousetracker
   {p}experimenting with
   <l>fad
   <l>muon
   <p>I've been pretty much in all projects ars is associated with at some
   point with the notable exception of BOINC.
   <p>of course that's not what makes me certifiable. what does is this
   propensity I have to collect stats for all these projects and put them
   occasionally up for public review. if this doesn't constitute insanity
   I don't know what does.
   <p>Cheers,
   <p>Marc

   <p>CPDN - Main thing I care about
   <p>DIMES - doesn't use any cpu time (barely)
   <p>MouseTracker - 'useless'
   <p>Used to run SETI, and SETI@BOINC.

    

   <h>pizzaking

                               

   <p>Only contributing to a couple of projects these days;
   <p>F@H - Windows boxes and my main project
   <p>GIMPS - Mainly FreeBSD boxes, my install and forget project
   <p>Although over the years I've also contributed to; D2OL, DF phases 1
   and 2, ECCp-109, ECC2-109, G@H, OGR24 (or it might have been OGR25, I
   forget) and SETI.
   <p>and I'm still a statswhore....

   <h>VJS

                          

   <p>I kind of like to stay focused on one project and one project only at
   a time.
   <p>Once entirely exhausted on a project I don't look back. Basically
   something else has to come around and really spark my interest to
   change.
   <p>I believe this is the ultimate illness where one project can consume
   you entirely.

         

   <h>Rattledagger

                          

   <p>Hmm, have crunched seti for 3 different teams and CPDN for a 4th last
   month, so...
   <p>Anyway, past projects in falling order: SETI@home "classic",
   Genome@home, UD "think", Folding@home, CPDN "classic", Distributed
   Folding.
   <p>Current projects, various combinations of: CPDN/BOINC, Einstein@home,
   Folding@home/BOINC, LHC@home, Predictor@home, SETI@home/BOINC.

 

   <h>Larry Loen

                             

   <p>In my most active period, I never ran more than two projects at a
   time.
   <p>There was turnover, however, in terms of which two it was.

      
   <h>Loudergood

                            

   <p>I'm running a few, I'm just not at liberty to say what they are at the
   moment. Big Grin

   <h>Thomasn

                      

   <p>I think I had FAH as main, with a bottomhugger of rc5 and one
   bottomhugger of manual ecm tests (when fah was unstable and I lacked
   FAH wu). That was on the home machine, did Find a drug at work, and
   ogr at the university.
   <p>Now I focus on one project at a time, was FAH, which I got to 100000
   points, now I have switched to rc5, goal is to reach 1M wus, currently
   35K or so Wink
   <p>So : you are not ill. I found after a time though that with only 5
   cpus, you have to focus to gain ranks fast. Yes I am a stats whore

   <p>I am currently running SoB and DIMES.
   <pI just finished up running Seti Classic. I will not be BOINC'ing until
   the client(s) have all of the bugs worked out.

   <l>Seti Classic
   <l>GAH
   <l>FAH
   <l>Ubero
   <l>ECCp-109
   <l>ECC2-109

   <l>Distr Folding phase one ( I beleive )
   <p>I tend to stay with one project at a time but am running two more
   often now.

      

   <h>Jamilla

                             

   <p>Any particular reason why you move around so much? I know that I have
   certain teams here that I stay with as I have certain teams elsewhere
   that I stay with. Can't spread myself too thin so I stay with one
   group at a time and run their DC projects and vice-versa.
   <p>Plus everybody should know where their allegiances lie.
   <p>Jammy
   <p>EDIT >>>oooo . . .I forgot the last part of the question: Should I
   seek help? Uh . . .I don't think there is any kind of help available
   for being a stats whore. I have tried weaning myself away from my
   computers and can successfully stay away for three hours. i did move
   one of my boxes into the bedroom because it has a nice 19" flat panel
   that I can turn around and watch my DVDs on, lol.

       
   <h>Rattledagger

                           
   <p>Joined the BBR-forums to answer a bandwith-question from "someone"
   Frown and like other Anandtech-users made a seti-account there to get
   the spinning globe. But, instead of only crunching one wu like most of
   the others, decided on keeping wu-count higher than post-count.
   <p>Keeping this up in SETI@home/BOINC is mostly for testing-purposes of
   BOINC client, and 99% of the time is only using one account so an
   ocassional result for another team shouldn't really be a problem.
   <p>While my original seti-team didn't really handle the transition to
   v3.03 very well, when they made a CPDN/BOINC-team decided to crunch a
   little for them. Since uses CPDN as backup-project, it can be some
   time between each trickle. Wink
