<div align=right><a href="/vad/article.php?id=27&aid=126&template_file=printfriendly.html">Printerfriendly</a></div><p>From: &quot;Ragnar Redbeard&quot; </p>
</b> 
<p>It has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response to my 
  question regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its roots in numerology. 
  This is the school of thought that agree with. The number 666 has its origins 
  in ancient numerology / astrology, and is connected to what are called &quot;magic 
  squares&quot;. The ancients devised a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered 
  in such a way that by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total 
  each time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made 
  up of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36 is of course, 
  666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of 666 which are attached 
  to the 12 signs of the Zodiac.</p>
<p>666 = Pisces<br>
  333 = Aquarius<br>
  222 = Capricorn<br>
  111 = Sagitaurus<br>
  74 = Scorpio<br>
  37 = Libra<br>
  18 = Virgo<br>
  9 = Leo<br>
  6 = Cancer<br>
  3 = Gemini<br>
  2 = Taurus<br>
  1 = Aries</p>
<p>Here is what the Sun Square looks like:</p>
<p>6 32 3 34 35 1<br>
  7 11 27 28 8 30<br>
  19 14 16 15 23 24<br>
  18 20 22 21 17 13<br>
  25 29 10 9 26 12<br>
  36 5 33 4 2 31</p>
<p>The factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and 1. They 
  are attached to the Zodiac signs as follows:</p>
<p> So, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each of 
  the 6 columns also has a total of 111.</p>
<p>The Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total 74 ( 9 
  X 74 = 666 ) One example is &quot;6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74&quot;</p>
<p>For those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74 were 
  considered &#39;holy&#39; numbers, associated with the Sun, which they revered. Numerology 
  / Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica) also became a recurring phenomenon 
  in the bible, particularely the KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to 
  Hermetica are found to be recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious.</p>
<p>The famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists in 1 
  Kings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from neighboring kingdoms. 
  Solomon is one of the more important examples of this biblically coded wisdom.</p>
<p>Solomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during his 
  reign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and the 12 tribes 
  of Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue found in 1 Kings is one 
  hint - another is the name Solomon. &quot;Sol&quot; is the Latin word for the Sun, &quot;Om&quot; 
  is the Hindi word for the Sun, and &quot;On&quot; is the Egyptian word for the Sun.</p>
<p>While 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology found 
  in the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First a quick point 
  regarding history:</p>
<p>In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the 
  official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the topic of another 
  discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For the next 1500 years, all 
  other religions or philosophies were ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, 
  to the point of knowledge of many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, 
  realizing that practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to 
  the torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid their 
  knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were practically the only 
  ones with any sort of education, and thus were trusted to read, write, and interpret 
  for Rome. Fast forward to somewhere in the 1600&#39;s when King James decided that 
  the bible should be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars 
  including Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew 
  & Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds that 
  sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV in such a way 
  that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All one has to do is decipher 
  it.</p>
<p>Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it is arranged 
  the way it is. If someone was to write a code without leaving any sort of decoding 
  manual, it stands to reason that the means of decoding his work would have to 
  be included in his work. The first step to deciphering this code would be to 
  look for extremes. Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center 
  of the bible (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. 
  As such, it almost jumps out and screams &quot;Hey, look at me!&quot; Psalms 117 has exactly 
  33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life of Christ, and 33 
  generations from Adam to David.</p>
<p>*There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the works 
  attributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of this theory. 
  Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible. You will find that it 
  is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter and find that the 46th word is 
  &quot;Shake&quot;. Count 46 words backwards from the end of that chapter and find that 
  the 46th word is &quot;spear&quot;. The mathematical laws of probability eliminate the 
  &quot;coincidence&quot; theory, and we conclude that with this method of &quot;counting the 
  bible&quot; rather than reading the bible we are on the right track.</p>
<p>Due to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other than Church 
  approved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate knowledge of pre-Christian 
  religious practices (particularely those related to Numerology) is scarce. Some 
  rudimentary information still remains, such as the names and fables associated 
  with the Pagan lore, along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts. 
  Many are familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the 
  whole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that exists 
  in today&#39;s New Age circles consists mainly of simple clairvoyance and &quot;love 
  spells&quot;. Many New Age occultists use the principles of Gematria and such to 
  discover &quot;their&quot; number, and so on.</p>
<p>Ancient &#39;magicians&#39; used 7 unique number squares as the basis for their wisdom. 
  Each square was arranged in such a way that the total of any column or row was 
  the same. Each of the seven &#39;magic&#39; squares was also assigned a planetary value. 
  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated 
  with a specific square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible 
  coding. The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every 
  number from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the six rows 
  adds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is from the Magic 
  Square of the Sun that the infamous number 666 originates. 6 columns X 111 = 
  666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are 
  a total of 3 squares and 6 rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds 
  to 74, and are listed below. 9 rectangles & squares X 74 = 666.</p>
<p>6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74</p>
<p>11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74</p>
<p>16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74</p>
<p>7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74</p>
<p>19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74</p>
<p>32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74</p>
<p>3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74</p>
<p>14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74</p>
<p>27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74</p>
<p>The numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will turn up 
  elsewhere later.</p>
<p>Very possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be found 
  in the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The number 666 
  has 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with the 12 signs of 
  the Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or 12 signs of the Zodiac) 
  serve to form a theme which was to become common in many later religions. Odin 
  had 12 chief priests, Solomon had 12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. 
  The 1 + 12 phenomenon is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there 
  is a Judge, and twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and 
  twelve Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious 
  analogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the Sun Square, 
  and the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.</p>
<p>It should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore sharing 
  the 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling. Furthermore, since 
  the 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western religions, it is likely that they 
  originate from one source. This source has been given many names throughout 
  the centuries and usually takes the form of secret societies. At one point it 
  was discovered that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was 
  long known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people realized 
  that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound arrangements had a soothing 
  effect, while some had an angering effect, or a saddening effect. Ancient temples 
  were often constructed in such a way that the songs sung during services would 
  have a maximum effect on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render 
  humans unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to conceal. 
  Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the detriment of society. 
  When languages were constructed, their vowels and consonants were assigned numerical 
  values. The study of this alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria, 
  and Gematria is used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.).</p>
<p>Deities, or important figures in mythology and religion are constructed in 
  accordance with the principles outlined above. English Gematria assigns the 
  value of &quot;1&quot; to the letter &quot;A&quot;, and &quot;2&quot; to the letter &quot;B&quot;, etc. With this in 
  mind, look at the word &quot;Jesus&quot;:</p>
<p>J E S U S</p>
<p>10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74</p>
<p>Let it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to &quot;888&quot; in Greek Gematria. 
  Greek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8 characters, and the 24th characther 
  has a value of 800. Jesus is referred to as being the offspring of David throughout 
  the bible, and that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of 
  Jesus can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the 
  Mars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single digits, 
  we observe the following phenomenon:</p>
<p>2 6 7 2 3</p>
<p>4 3 7 8 7 </p>
<p>8 5 4 3 9</p>
<p>1 9 1 5 4</p>
<p>5 6 1 2 6</p>
<p>After drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the points 
  on the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that each triangle has 
  a value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at the number &#39;7&#39; in the first 
  row, and its two base points sit at 4 and 1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted 
  triangle has its upper right point at the 7 in the last column, and travels 
  across the column to arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1 
  at the tip. Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the 
  number 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel across the 
  horizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This is why Jesus is referred 
  to as a branch of David.</p>
<p>Note that the word &quot;Joshua&quot; adds to &quot;74&quot; in the same way Jesus does, and incidentally 
  so does the word &quot;occult&quot;.</p>
<p>Even though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named &quot;Shakespeare&quot; 
  wrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting &#39;coincidence&#39; is found 
  by employing the coding concepts used by Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing 
  of the KJV). If we count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we 
  arrive at Psalm 46. Excluding the mysterious word &quot;selah&quot; (which appears 74 
  times throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the chapter 
  and find the 46th word to be &quot;shake&quot;. The 46th word from the end of the chapter 
  is &quot;spear&quot;. This is coincidental to the theory held by some that Francis Bacon 
  wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare</p>
<p>When constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a &#39;decoder&#39;s 
  guide&#39; a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to show us the structure 
  of the code. Tools such as longest, shortest, and repetition serve to draw attention. 
  In keeping with this theory, we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible, 
  Psalm 117, is also placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words, 
  which by no coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number 
  of generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in Freemasonry.</p>
<p>On counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we find that 
  the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters backwards from Psalm 117, 
  we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7. The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings 
  7 detail the construction of Solomon&#39;s Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings 
  6, and construction ends in 1 Kings 7.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the word &quot;temple&quot; is often associated with perfected man, 
  and wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within the biblical concept 
  of Solomon. The word &quot;Solomon&quot; serves a dual purpose in the coding of the bible. 
  The word &quot;Sol&quot; is Latin for &quot;sun&quot;, the word &quot;Om&quot; is Hindi for &quot;sun&quot; and the 
  word &quot;On&quot; is Egyptian for &quot;sun&quot;. Also, the vowel &quot;o&quot; is symmetrically placed 
  throughout the word 3 times. Note that &quot;o&quot; is the 15th letter in the alphabet:</p>
<p>O O O</p>
<p>15 15 15</p>
<p> 1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666</p>
<p>Even when presented with information such as this, the Christians will grow 
  stronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology is evil. Sometimes 
  it will be suggested that perhaps this coding was designed by the devil to discredit 
  the &#39;truth&#39; of Christianity. Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and 
  the Sun Square, and makes references to the &#39;temple&#39;, all of which are concepts 
  borrowed from the ancient Occult.</p>
<p>Not unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number &quot;7&quot; in religion and 
  mythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation is a reference to the 
  7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in the bible:</p>
<p>Seven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6), Seven lamps 
  of fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are all references to the 
  7 magic squares.</p>
<p>Sometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are used, and 
  in Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the belief system held by 
  Francis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the King James Bible. Revelation 2:17 
  reads</p>
<p>&quot;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; 
  To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give 
  him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth 
  saving he that receiveth it&quot;</p>
<p>In this case, the passage points to a new name written in &#39;a white stone&#39;. 
  If one were to unscramble the words &#39;a white stone&#39; we will get &#39;thee is wotan&#39;. 
  Remember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known as Asatru, and sometimes goes 
  by the name &#39;Woden&#39; or &#39;Odin&#39;. The odds on that being a coincidence simply cannot 
  be fathomed.</p>
<p>Other than the passages to be unscrambled (&quot;a white stone&quot; - &quot;thee is wotan&quot;) 
  and the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the words in the bible 
  are &#39;filler&#39;, which serve no real interpretive purpose. The bible is so full 
  of contradictions and pure nonsense that it only stands to reason that it was 
  not meant to be read, but counted. Other theories suggest that the King James 
  bible was written as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest 
  that Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the 
  KJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom. Both theories 
  fit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that the whole story will ever 
  be known.</p>
<p>Now that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will begin to 
  fall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the wisdom encoded into 
  the KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a few, and persecuted by religious 
  tyrants for hundreds of years. This essay outlined a few pointers and coding 
  principles and the reader is encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the 
  bible, don&#39;t read it!</p>
