      <h3><font face="Arial"><a name="eutro"></a>Eutrophication</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Concentrations in Welsh rivers of the main 
        plant nutrients (phosphate and nitrate) are generally much lower than 
        those found in the midlands and south-east England. There are correspondingly 
        fewer perceived problems associated with eutrophication compared with 
        lowland England. However, nutrient enrichment arising from sewage inputs 
        and agriculture does cause water quality problems in all types of aquatic 
        environment, affecting drinking water supplies, conservation interests 
        and recreational uses.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of water-supply reservoirs are regularly 
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">affected by blue-green algal blooms 
        notably Llandegfedd, Wentwood, Cefni and Nant-y-Frith, with implications 
        for water treatment and supply. Conservation interests are being affected 
        at a number of important wetland sites on Anglesey, at Bosherston Lakes 
        in south Pembrokeshire and at Llangorse Lake near Brecon. Eutrophication 
        is affecting the survival of two endangered fish species: the gwyniad 
        in Llyn Tegid and the arctic charr in Llyn Padarn. Blooms of blue-green 
        algae can interfere with recreational activities </font><font face="Arial" size="2">at 
        a number of waters, including Llysyfran Reservoir and Eglwys Nunydd. Despite 
        the environmental safeguards to deal with the consequences of eutrophication 
        specified in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act, algal blooms are likely to affect 
        recreational uses and aesthetic enjoyment within the impoundment.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><a href="../images/4_10.jpg"><img src="../images/thumbnails/4_10small.jpg" width="300" height="197" align="right" hspace="10" border="0" alt="A blue-green algal bloom at Llyn Tegid"></a>The 
        Wye below Hereford and the Loughor below Garnswllt STW have been designated 
        as sensitive areas under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. In 
        both stretches, phosphate inputs from sewage works have been shown </font><font face="Arial" size="2">to 
        promote plant growth which may cause serious </font><font face="Arial" size="2">de-oxygenation 
        during the night under conditions of </font><font face="Arial" size="2">high 
        temperature and low river flow. Resulting low concentrations of dissolved 
        oxygen have been implicated in fish mortalities on the lower Loughor in 
        1984, 1990 and 1995. Besides these designations, there are many smaller 
        watercourses in lowland areas which are affected by growths of algae. 
        These effects appear to be chiefly related to inputs of nutrients from 
        agricultural sources and may reduce the survival of salmonid eggs and 
        fry in heavily affected stretches. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In general, scientific understanding of the 
        links between nutrient inputs and eutrophication in estuarine and </font><font face="Arial" size="2">coastal 
        waters is much less advanced than for freshwaters. Nevertheless, eutrophication 
        appears to be connected with periodic low concentrations of dissolved 
        oxygen in the Loughor and Dee estuaries. The impoundment created </font><font face="Arial" size="2">by 
        the Tawe Barrage in Swansea is subject to blooms of marine algae, and 
        the impoundment has already been designated as a sensitive area. </font></p>

        records indicate that algal blooms in coastal waters have been a periodic 
        natural occurrence. However, the concentration of blooms of Phaeocystis 
        between Liverpool Bay and the Menai Strait in north Wales, around Aberystwyth 
        and in Carmarthen Bay suggest an influence of enhanced nutrient inputs 
        in these areas arising from sewage, agricultural run-off and industrial 
        discharges. Concentrations of nutrients and algae in the Irish Sea have 
        risen steadily since the 1960s, so this problem appears to be increasing. 
        Foams and scums arising from blooms are aesthetically unpleasant, can 
        be mistaken for sewage and give rise to numerous public complaints over 
        bathing water quality. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Blooms of toxic marine algae are relatively 
        rare around the Welsh coast although blooms of the dinoflagellate <i>Gyrodinium 
        aureolum</i> have been linked to fish and shellfish mortalities in Swansea 
        Bay in 1989 and St. Brides Bay, Pembrokeshire in 1994. Other blooms of 
        potentially toxic alga include the dinoflagellate <i>Alexandrium tamarense</i> 
        which has been recorded in the upper part of Milford Haven since 1995, 
        and a bloom of Dinophysis was recorded within the Tawe impoundment in 
        1995. The former can produce Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and the latter 
        Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, but no effects on human health have been 
        observed to date. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The distribution of individual synthetic 
        chemicals in the Welsh environment reflects their physical and chemical 
        properties, and the way in which they are dispersed. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
        persistent substances are poorly soluble in water but soluble in fat. 
        They therefore attach to sediment particles, accumulate in the fatty tissues 
        of animals, and pose the greatest risk to animals at the top of food chains. 
        In freshwater these are fish-or insect-eating aquatic birds and aquatic 
        mammals, such as otters, and in the marine environment seals, porpoises, 
        dolphins and seabirds are at greatest risk. Clearly humans are also at 
        potential risk from the consumption of contaminated wild animals. The 
        techniques for monitoring distribution and measuring </font><font face="Arial" size="2">the 
        effect of these chemicals are difficult and expensive. Consequently only 
        the apparent high priority chemicals have received attention so far, and 
        techniques are still being developed for many groups of synthetic pollutants.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PCBs</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">PCBs have been found to be present in freshwater 
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">eel tissue at sites throughout Wales, 
        but highest concentrations were found in the lower reaches of industrialised 
        catchments in the south-east and north<sup><a href="references.htm#30">30</a></sup>. 
        Aerial inputs derived from global sources may also be </font><font face="Arial" size="2">a 
        significant route for PCBs found in dipper eggs (an insectiverous riverine 
        bird) at remote rural sites<sup><a href="references.htm#31">31</a></sup>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the marine environment, contamination 
        is related to past industrial production, use, disposal and subsequent 
        transport with fine sediment. Marine sediments are</font><font face="Arial" size="2">‘heavily 
        contaminated’ close to river mouths and docks </font><font face="Arial" size="2">in

        Although fish from Cardigan Bay and the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">Severn

        concentrations have been found in marine mammals </font><font face="Arial" size="2">from

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Dioxins</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The greatest risk of contamination by dioxins/furans 
        is </font><font face="Arial" size="2">near potential sources such as waste 
        incinerators. The Welsh Office commissioned a study of dioxins/furans 
        and PCBs in the environment around the high-temperature incineration plant 
        of Rechem at Pontypool in 1991<sup><a href="references.htm#33">33</a></sup>. 
        With the exception of a localised area within 500m of the plant, measured 
        concentrations of PCBs and dioxins/furans in </font><font face="Arial" size="2">the 
        environment provided little evidence of levels of contamination any different 
        from those encountered in similar areas elsewhere in the UK. The effects 
        of this plant should not give rise to undue concern, according to accepted 
        criteria and guidance on health effects for </font><font face="Arial" size="2">these 
        compounds.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Pesticides</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Organochlorine pesticides were used for a 
        wide range of applications in Wales, sheep dipping and wool preparation 
        being the main rural use. Use of dieldrin and DDT in the UK was banned 
        in the late 1980s, but significant residues of these pesticides remain 
        in eels from agriculture-intensive and industrialised catchments. In the 
        marine environment they are still found in the fatty tissues of marine 
        mammals, and an inshore Cardigan Bay sediment sample contained the highest 
        level of dieldrin contamination of all sites in a national survey<sup><a href="references.htm#35">35</a></sup>. 
        Pentachlorophenol was synthesised in Wales and is still found in the discharge 
        from the manufacturing site, although production ceased many years ago. 
        Residues remain in sediments surrounding the discharge, and a slight effect 
        on the invertebrate community there is evident. The biological impacts 
        of organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroids are covered in <a href="4_2.htm">Section 
        4.2.</a> </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>PAHs</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that 
        result from combustion of fossil fuels and waste material are found widely 
        in industrialised areas, in road run-off and in marine sediments close 
        to shorelines. Many are moderately persistent in the environment, but 
        are broken down in fish and higher vertebrate animals. They can cause 
        the same sorts of cellular effects as PCBs and dioxins.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Organotin</b></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Use of tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paint 
        on boats less than 25m in length ceased in 1987, and the application and 
        removal of such paints on boats of 25m or more became subject to regulation 
        in 1996. Evidence of impact on the affected species (dog whelk) is limited 
        to parts of Milford Haven and Holyhead harbour, close to current sources 
        of TBT on large vessels<sup><a href="references.htm#35">35</a></sup>. 
        Organotin compounds have been used in other applications and their well-documented 
        endocrine disruptive effect may require further assessment. </font></p>

        in Wales show that the average radon concentration in Welsh homes is 20 
        becquerels/cubic metre, equivalent to about half of the total radioactive 
        dose received by the population<sup><a href="references.htm#36">36</a></sup>. 
        Radon levels are higher than this average in parts of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire, 
        Radnorshire, Anglesey and north-east Wales due to the underlying geology. 
        More extensive areas with high radon concentrations occur elsewhere in 
        the UK such as Cornwall and parts of north-east Scotland. Raised levels 
        of radon </font><font face="Arial" size="2">gas increase the risks of 
        lung cancer and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has 
        advised that indoor radon above an Action Level of 200 bequerels/cubic 
        metre should be reduced. It has been estimated that Wales has about 10,000 
        homes with radon levels above this level. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In June 1998, the Welsh Office announced 
        a targeted testing programme for four areas at the highest risk from radon 
        gas emitted by natural sources. Householders in these areas can receive 
        detectors from the NRPB to monitor radon gas in their properties over 
        a three-month period. The need for measures to reduce levels will then 
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">be evaluated. Grants to assist in this 
        work may be available from local authorities. New homes are protected 
        through the building requirements in high-radon areas.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The results of extensive monitoring of the 
        effects of nuclear facilities on levels of radiation in the environment 
        are reported annually by MAFF. This includes an assessment of the maximum 
        exposure to radiation to humans from each source. For terrestrial sources, 
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2">these assessments are generally based 
        on concentrations in agricultural produce local to the nuclear facility. 
        For aquatic foodstuffs, the assessment is based on concentrations in species 
        commonly harvested for human consumption. </font><font face="Arial" size="2">The 
        calculation of the dose received is based on consumers with the highest 
        potential intake of the food in question<sup><a href="references.htm#37">37</a></sup>. 
        The exposure from each of the nuclear facilities in Wales was a small 
        percentage of the maximum limit (1 millisievert) for members of the public 
        from artificial sources of radiation (<a href="images/fig4-20.gif">Figure 
        4.20</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Monitoring in 1998 of the impact of the discharges 
        from Amersham in Cardiff established that there were relatively high concentrations 
        of tritium in flounders (up to 50,000 bequerels/kilogram) caught near 
        the effluent discharge from the plant and also in sediments within the 
        Severn Estuary. Previously it had been assumed, in accordance with other 
        studies, that concentrations in fish would be similar to that of ambient 
        seawater. The finding that tritium could be bioaccumulated required a 
        reassessment of the radiation dose to the critical group of fish consumers 
        in Cardiff, and the 1997 figure of 3% has been revised to 6%. This is 
        still a small proportion of the dose limit but nevertheless the unexpected 
        bioaccumulation of tritium was of concern and resulted in a requirement 
        for tritium discharges to be reduced significantly (see <a href="5_7.htm">Section 
        5.7)</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A survey was undertaken in 1997 to determine 
        the concentration of technetium-99 in selected animals and plants around 
        the Welsh coast. Highest concentrations (1836 bequerels/kilogram) were 
        found in brown seaweed at sites closest to the Sellafield discharge along 
        the north Wales coast. Concentrations decreased southwards with lowest 
        amounts present at sites in the Bristol Channel. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The highest concentration found in periwinkles 
        in the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">same survey was 152 bequerels/kilogram. 
        This is not a high concentration in relation to the risk to human health 
        since consumption of 12 kilograms would result in a radiation dose of 
        1 microsievert, which is only 0.1% of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2">dose

        of nitrogen and sulphur deposition<sup><a href="references.htm#39">39</a>, 
        <a href="references.htm#40">40</a></sup> (<a href="images/fig4-21.gif">Figure 
        4.21</a>).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Cuts in sulphur emissions have reduced deposition 
        in upland Wales from 30–50 kg/ha/year in 1984 to 20–30 kg/ha/year in 1995. 
        Cuts in emissions of oxidised nitrogen have also contributed to reducing 
        the affected area, but substantial further progress is needed<sup><a href="references.htm#25">25</a></sup>. 
        The effects of reductions to date are apparent in declining sulphate concentrations 
        and slight reductions in the acidity of 77 streams surveyed in 1984 and 
        1995. However, these improvements have not yet led to biological recovery 
        (<a href="4_2.htm">Section 4.2</a>).</font></p>
