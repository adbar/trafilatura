      <div id="intro"> <!-- #BeginEditable "intro" -->Many educators and communities are searching for evidence on the best way to provide a high-quality education for their children and to make the best use of their education funds. One area that is of perennial interest is how to best configure the grades in local schools. Public education in the United States provides for kindergarten through grade 12 in a variety of grade arrangements, from the K-12 school to separate schools for single grades. Unfortunately, as Paglin and Fager (1997) point out: &quot;Research has not provided definitive answers to the myriad possible questions about grade span, but the questions have never gone away. They are questions which arise whenever school reform, increasing or declining enrollment, or financial considerations bring about a reorganization of existing schools, the building of new schools, or consolidation of districts&quot; (p. 2). Much of the research available has been done on rural or middle schools. The research on the &quot;best&quot; grade configuration is inconclusive. At best, it indicates factors to be considered in deciding on a school's grade span or a community's configuration of grades within its elementary and secondary school system.<!-- #EndEditable --> </div>

            <h2><a name="configuration"></a>How 
              do schools differ in grade configuration?</h2>
            <p>Schools in 
              the United States are organized in different ways: some schools 
              include K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, or K-12; others are organized 
              as middle schools, junior high schools, and senior high schools; 
              and still others consist of students in just one grade, such as 
              a kindergarten center or a ninth-grade center. Some schools include 
              pre-kindergarten. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center 
              for Education Statistics (2002) provides data on the number of regular 
              public school districts providing instruction and the percentage 
              of students in membership, by grade span and by state, for the school 
              year 2000-2001 (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/2003310.pdf">http://nces.ed.gov</a><a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2003/2003310.pdf">/pubs2003/2003310.pdf</a>, 
              Table 3).</p>
            <h2><a name="sglconfiguration"></a><b>Single-grade-level 
              configurations</b></h2>
            <p>The literature 
              suggests that some school districts have found advantages to schools 
              that contain students at one grade level, although these advantages 
              are not necessarily supported by research (Reents, 2002):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A single-grade 
                center, such as a school only for ninth-graders, can develop programs 
                specific to the needs of that age group.</li>
              <li>Siphoning 
                off students from several schools can relieve overcrowding at 
                those schools. </li>
              <li>Students 
                may be able to participate on an equal level in more activities 
                and be less influenced by older students.</li>
              <li>The greater 
                number of students in single-grade centers may enable the school 
                to increase course offerings.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The literature 
              also suggests some possible disadvantages to separate single-grade 
              configurations (Hopkins, 1997):</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The cost 
                and length of student travel increases, particularly in a school 
                district that covers a large area. </li>
              <li>Parent involvement 
                may decrease, possibly affected by the distance to the school 
                and the number of schools a family's children attend.</li>
              <li>Students 
                are required to make an increased number of school transitions.</li>
              <li>Fewer opportunities 
                are provided for interaction between age groups.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Hopkins (1997) 
              also suggests some additional factors for school districts to consider:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Combining 
                schools into separate grade centers may affect whether neighborhood 
                schools close or remain open.</li>
              <li>Current 
                buildings may have a design more suitable for several grade levels.</li>
              <li>School population 
                may increase or decrease substantially as configurations change.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="oconf"></a><b>Other 
              grade-level configurations: Middle schools, K-12</b></h2>
            <p>&quot;Much 
              of what has happened with regards to school grade structure can 
              be attributed to the development of the middle school&quot; (Franklin 
              &amp; Glascock, 1996, p. 4). The separation of students in grades 
              5 or 6 to 7 or 8 in middle schools is justified by some school districts 
              because districts believe that middle schools better meet the developmental 
              needs of preadolescents. As Howley (2002) points out, the developmental 
              needs of young adolescents differ from those of elementary school 
              children and older teenagers. &quot;Developmentally responsive middle 
              schools must take into account all that is known about young adolescents 
              and the cultural context in which they live&quot; (Lounsbury, 1996). 
              The number of middle schools increased by 35% from 1967 to 2000 
              (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp</a>).</p>
            <p>In the past 
              decade, researchers also have demonstrated renewed interest in schools 
              that include grades kindergarten through 12. A study of rural schools 
              that examined the relationship between grade configuration and student 
              achievement in Louisiana found that students in K-12 rural schools 
              did as well or better on achievement tests as students in separate 
              elementary, middle, or high schools. Students in high poverty areas 
              also did better in the K-12 schools (Franklin &amp; Glascock, 1996). 
              A similar study in Texas analyzed data from a study of 1001 Texas 
              high schools, including 116 K-12 schools. This study produced similar 
              results (Bickel, Howley, Williams, &amp; Glascock, 2000).</p>
            <h2><b><a name="hconf"></a>How 
              do grade configurations affect transitions?</b></h2>
            <p>The division 
              of elementary schools into configurations that include fewer grades 
              requires that students make several transitions from one school 
              to another. Researchers note that transitions can be stressful for 
              students:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Alspaugh 
                (1999) found a significant achievement loss during each transition 
                year. He also found that some students regain what is lost in 
                the following year, but it would seem that students who make fewer 
                transitions need fewer years to make up for achievement losses 
                caused by transitions. </li>
              <li>Another 
                study found that each time students switched schools, their feelings 
                of anonymity increased. Researchers who found that sixth-grade 
                students in both elementary and combination K-12 schools outperformed 
                students in middle schools or junior high schools considered the 
                number of transitions a significant factor. This study considered 
                8 schools with 7 different grade spans with student populations 
                of 82 to 1,200. The schools were located in both urban and rural 
                settings in 5 northwest states. The number of grades in the schools 
                ranged from 1 to 11 (Paglin &amp; Fager, 1997). </li>
              <li>Another 
                research study found that girls in early adolescence suffered 
                from a drop in self-esteem, extracurricular participation, and 
                leadership behaviors when they made the transition into middle 
                school or junior high, but not if they remained in an elementary 
                school setting. This study found that the effects of this transition 
                lingered throughout the school years. For boys, the study found 
                similar negative effects in extracurricular participation and 
                grades, but not in self-esteem, when they made the transition 
                into middle school or junior high. The authors concluded that 
                the relatively protected elementary school setting made the entry 
                into adolescence less stressful for both boys and girls. The students 
                who had not had the stress of the earlier transition seemed to 
                cope better with the transition into high school than did other 
                students (Simmons &amp; Blyth, 1987). </li>
              <li>Franklin 
                and Glascock (1996) found that sixth-grade boys experienced more 
                suspensions in middle schools or junior high schools than in elementary 
                schools, possibly related to the effects of the transition, the 
                school organization, or school size. This study was based on information 
                gathered from all Louisiana public schools during the 1992-1993 
                school year.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2><a name="wconf"></a>What 
              factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade configuration? 
      </h2>
            <p>Researchers 
              at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory looked at eight 
              schools with seven different grade spans. They examined the history 
              of each school's decision on grade configuration along with observed 
              advantages and disadvantages of each configuration and principals' 
              comments on the success of their programs (Paglin &amp; Fager, 1997). 
              Based on this research, Paglin and Fager compiled a list of nine 
              factors that school districts might want to consider when making 
              decisions about grade configurations of individual schools:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>the cost 
                and length of student travel, particularly in a school district 
                that covers a large area</li>
              <li>a possible 
                increase or decrease in parent involvement, possibly affected 
                by the distance to the school and the number of schools a family's 
                children attend</li>
              <li>the number 
                of students at each grade level, which may affect class groupings 
                and courses offered</li>
              <li>the effect 
                of school setting on achievement, particularly for grades 6-9</li>
              <li>effect on 
                whether the neighborhood schools close or remain open </li>
              <li>the number 
                of school transitions for students</li>
              <li>the opportunities 
                for interaction between age groups</li>
              <li>the influence 
                of older students on younger students</li>
              <li>the building 
                design-is it suitable for only a few or for several grade levels?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Paglin and 
              Fager concluded that designing a school system to use a particular 
              span of grades in individual schools will not in itself guarantee 
              that students will learn well and be well adjusted. </p>

              This report contains research and recommendations on the grade configuration 
              of two elementary schools. Key points of considerations include:

            <p>The effect of grade span configuration (grouping of grades in schools) and school-to-school transition on student achievement was investigated. The Michigan Education Assessment Program test was used to collect data on the passing rate of students in 232 schools in a large urban inner city school district in the midwest. The results indicate that grade span configuration and school-to-school transition had significant positive and negative effects on student achievement respectively. The paper discusses implications for school districts. (Author) </p>

            <p> This cross-sectional 
              study used primarily quantitative methods to investigate the superior 
              achievement of 4th- and 5th-grade students at Alaska's Kenai Peninsula 
              Borough School District who as young elementary students had attended 
              K-2 primary school, compared to peers who had attended a K-6, K-8, 
              or K-12 configured school. Since this study was limited to a single 
              school district that included all four elementary school configurations 
              in communities that were found to be similar, variables that historically 
              confuse the application of results to conclusions were systematically 
              eliminated as causal factors. To study the effect of the remaining 
              variables on student outcome, educational instructors that had experience 
              teaching in both a K-2 and other configurations within the district 
              were surveyed. The survey findings revealed the magnitude of the 
              variance between causal agents known to affect future student success 
              that exists in the K-2 versus other configuration elementary schools. 
              In order of decreasing magnitude, the following variables are more 
              prevalent in the K-2 environment than in other configurations, and 
              their increased presence related to superior student achievement 
              in later years: Resources, Parental Involvement, Collaboration (among 
              administrators, teachers, and special services personnel), Foundation 
              (ability to establish social and emotional competence, language, 
              cognition, teaching strategies that lead to next levels of accomplishment), 
              Relevant Teacher Training, Teacher Efficacy (with regard to aligning 
              primary students' interests and abilities), High Expectations, Principal's 
              Leadership, Teacher's Stability, and School Climate. (A copy of

              explored the effects of attending public Philadelphia K-to-8 schools 
              or public middle schools on eighth- and ninth-grade achievement. 
              Found that students attending K-8 schools had higher reading, mathematics, 
              and science achievement than students attending middle schools serving 
              similar communities. Suggested that number of students in a grade 
              rather than school size contributed to the difference. (KB)</p>

            <p>Research across 
              seven very different states has shown that as schools get larger, 
              the average achievement among economically disadvantaged students 
              declines. A traditionally strong argument against smaller schools, 
              however, is that they are too expensive. Large consolidated schools 
              with narrowly specialized grade spans are typically offered as necessary 
              to save money and to meet the needs of different age groups. This 
              paper examines whether the size-by-socioeconomic status interaction 
              effect proves robust across alternative regression model specifications, 
              as it did across different states. It also explores whether the 
              equity gains associated with smaller schools are incompatible with 
              the need to save money. Analysis with four different regression 
              model specifications consistently found that increased school size 
              was related to increases in achievement-test-score costs associated 
              with economically disadvantaged students. School size was negatively 
              related to expenditure per pupil, but this relationship became increasingly 
              tenuous as size increased, and eventually savings became negligible. 
              In addition, organizational factors, especially as manifest in the 
              distinctive components of the single-unit school, were related to 
              cost reduction. For those interested in balancing expenditure per 
              pupil with achievement-based equity, the best grade-span configuration 
              seems to be a small single-unit school. (Contains 76 references.)

            <p>Research has 
              revealed interactive effects of school size and socioeconomic status--as 
              school size increases, the mean measured achievement of schools 
              with disadvantaged students declines. The larger the number of less 
              advantaged students attending a school, the greater the decline. 
              This study also examined the claim that large schools with a narrow 
              range of grades necessarily save money by achieving economies of 
              scale. Results indicate that school size was negatively related 
              to costs, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as school 
              size increased, with savings eventually becoming negligible. In 
              addition, analysis of organizational factors distinct to the single-unit 
              school indicates that if schools are designed solely to minimize 
              expenditure per pupil, the best configuration may be a large single-unit 
              school. However, if expenditure per pupil is balanced with achievement-based 
              equity, the best configuration seems to be one small single-unit 
              school per district. While decreased size would increase costs, 
              the fact that there is only one school with 13-15 grade levels would 
              substantially diminish costs. (Contains 69 references.) (TD) </p>

            <p>This booklet 
              is the fourth in a series of &quot;hot topic&quot; reports, that 
              address current educational concerns. The booklet examines questions 
              relating to grade configurations, its purpose being to increase 
              awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding grade span. 
              It explores the ways that schools have addressed concerns associated 
              with particular grade spans and suggests avenues for further inquiry. 
              The text focuses on historical trends in grade configuration and 
              the various contexts of grade spans, such as whether a school is 
              in a rural or an urban area. Most research on grade span focuses 
              on the middle grades and addresses such questions as: Which grades 
              should be grouped together in one school? How many grades should 
              be in one school? and How many school transitions will students 
              make during the K-12 years? Some tips for starting a school with 
              a grade span new to a school system are offered, followed by an 
              overview of grade-span considerations. The bulk of the volume describes 
              eight schools' experiences with grade spans, discussing such issues 
              as how the grade span came about and how the schools were structured 
              to meet the needs of the particular grades it contains. (RJM) </p>

            <p>For the past 
              decade in Connecticut, public school students have been tested in 
              the fall of grades 4, 6, and 8, and results have been attributed 
              to the school in which students are tested. Some Connecticut elementary 
              schools end at grade 5 (Type I) and some continue to grade 6 or 
              8 (Type II). Consistent results showed that schools that expected 
              to be accountable for sixth-grade results (Type II) produced better 
              performing sixth graders. Implications for designing and developing 
              accountability systems are discussed. (Contains six tables and four 
              references.) (Author/SLD) </p>

            <p> This report 
              presents selected results of a national study of school districts 
              operating at least one K-12 unit school. Of the 706 districts operating 
              unit schools, 157 districts in 27 states responded to the survey. 
              The majority of respondents (106) were superintendents of one-school 
              districts, that is, districts in which the K-12 unit school was 
              the only school. Of the 53 multischool districts, about half operated 
              just one K-12 unit school. Data reveal that K-12 unit schools were 
              usually located in an agricultural region where socioeconomic status 
              was lower than the national average; the average unit school enrollment 
              was 414; most unit schools in multischool districts were comparatively 
              remote from key resources such as hospitals, interstate highways, 
              and cities; superintendents of single-school districts reported 
              higher rates of above-average test scores, postsecondary attendance, 
              and high school completion than did superintendents of multischool 
              districts; satellite and Internet systems were the most prevalent 
              forms of distance learning technologies in use; community attitudes 
              toward single-school districts were moderately and positively related 
              to the sustainability of the school; single-school districts spent 
              almost 50 percent more per pupil than multischool districts; and 
              single-school districts more often than multischool districts employed 
              cooperative strategies for maximizing resources such as joining 
              regional service agencies or cooperating with other districts. Includes 
              data tables and recommendations for research and practice. Contains

            <p>This paper 
              examines the relationship between a school's grade configuration 
              and student performance in Louisiana. Results indicate that sixth- 
              and seventh-grade students performed better in elementary and K-12 
              schools than in middle or secondary schools, in terms of both achievement 
              and persistence. Students in K-12 schools performed as well as those 
              in elementary schools overall and performed better in some cases 
              (grade 6 and high poverty). For grades 9-12, the K-12 school was 
              more beneficial to students than the traditional secondary school, 
              particularly in the area of student persistence or conduct. With 
              regard to academic achievement, secondary schools did not differ 
              significantly from K-12 schools regardless of school size or SES. 
              School size did appear to impact 11th- and 12th-grade student persistence 
              more within the secondary school environment than that of the K-12 
              school. Contains 34 references and 29 data tables and figures. (Author/SV)

            <p>This paper 
              compares school district characteristics for rural Missouri K-8 
              and K-12 districts in four categories of enrollment size. A random 
              sample of 56 K-8 and 56 K-12 districts yielded 4 equal categories 
              of K-8 enrollment: 51-100, 101-150, 151-200, and more than 200 students. 
              Data are presented in graphic form for assessed valuation per pupil; 
              operating tax levy; expenditure per pupil; administrative cost per 
              pupil; teacher salaries; student-teacher ratio; and achievement 
              scores on the Missouri Mastery and Achievement Test (MMAT) for grades 
              3, 6, and 8. Two final graphs present data from 428 Missouri districts 
              showing that the high school dropout rate was positively related 
              to school size and negatively related to the high school grade span.

              schools serve the needs of young adolescents, aged 10 to 14, in 
              any combination of grades 5 through 8, as part of an organizational 
              structure that includes lower grades. Research has shown that middle 
              schools with 6-8 grade spans and K-8 schools are most likely to 
              implement child-centered programs, practices, and policies than 
              schools with 7-9 or 7-12 grade spans. (MLH) </p>

            <p>During 1968-91, 
              middle schools were the only school type to grow in number, increasing 
              by over 400 percent. Middle school advocates focus on early adolescents' 
              need for developmentally appropriate institutions, but show only 
              a weak historical understanding of the emergence and status of middle 
              schools. Critical factors in early support for the middle school 
              movement included urban interests in countering de facto school 
              segregation without use of busing, urban overcrowding of elementary 
              and high schools, and a &quot;bandwagon effect&quot;--the desire 
              to appear modern and reform oriented. The emergence of rural middle 
              schools under the cloak of psychological progress can be destructive 
              to both the declining sense of community in America, and to the 
              actual persistence of many rural communities still organized around 
              K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools. Examination of the National 
              Center for Education Statistics's Common Core of Data indicates 
              that the construction of rural middle schools has led to the closing 
              and consolidation of rural elementary schools. During the school 
              years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that were middle 
              schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged in suburban 
              areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same time, 
              the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined precipitously. 
              Emerging school reform agendas that provide alternatives to the 
              &quot;inevitability&quot; of consolidation include efforts to restructure 
              schools as caring communities (requiring active parent and community 
              participation), and the development of rural schools as centers 
              for integrated social services. Contains 52 references. (SV) </p>

            <p>Designed as 
              an overview of the progress of middle schools in the last two decades, 
              this document compares results from a 1968 survey that sampled 10 
              percent of middle schools with at least three, and not more than 
              five grades, and including grades 6 and 7, with those of a similar 
              1988 survey. Following a brief summary of the origins of the middle 
              school is a discussion of survey results regarding changes in rationale 
              and specific preparation undertaken for introducing middle school 
              organization and problems perceived in teacher education. Finally, 
              conclusions are presented regarding the differences between schools 
              containing grades 5-8 or 6-8 and those with grades 7 and 8 or 7-9. 
              Included are four tables and five graphs. (8 references) (CLA) </p>

            <p>The second 
              in a four-phase research project, this report presents data from 
              a stratified random sample of California middle schools using four 
              grade span configurations (K-8, 6-8, 7-8, and 7-9). This phase, 
              a pilot study, is designing a methodology to help researchers discriminate 
              among the number, percentage, and types of programs offered by the 
              various organizational patterns. The research is intended to assist 
              policymakers confronted with implementation decisions regarding 
              middle level programs. Future research should focus on program effectiveness 
              relative to &quot;transescents'&quot; needs and to goals established 
              by the individual school. Policymakers should explore various alternative 
              programs and practice modifications, regardless of the grade spans 
              adopted. (Eight references) (MLH) </p>

            <p>The junior 
              high school, typically grades 7-8 or 7-9, offers a program that 
              is &quot;not-<br>
              quite-yet-but-trying-to-be&quot; a high school. The organization 
              of the middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based 
              on a philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet 
              the special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate 
              unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary 
              and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one 
              or the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a &quot;failed&quot; 
              promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation 
              of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number 
              of new middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively 
              increased. A review of research on middle-level education indicates 
              that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by 
              attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact 
              on middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms 
              &quot;junior high school&quot; and &quot;middle school&quot; do 
              not define a school's program. Additionally, the effective schools 
              research has given rise to discriminant analyses of effective middle 
              school variables and allowed researchers to identify those characteristics 
              most commonly found within &quot;exemplary&quot; middle schools.

              many middle-level schools are changing from a traditional junior 
              high school structure (grades 7-9) to middle schools (grades 6-8). 
              A case study examined the impact of middle school organizational 
              changes that occurred as a large North Carolina school system converted 
              from junior high schools to middle schools on science teachers and 
              science instruction. The study found: that science instruction was 
              enhanced under the new organizational structure; teachers had more 
              instructional time; and teachers were supportive about the middle 
              school organization. (KR) </p>

            <p>Significant 
              differences among school grade-span types regarding the level of 
              program implementation are influenced by the level of philosophical

            <p>In its six 
              chapters, this report assesses the status of the sixth grade. The 
              shadow study technique was employed to address three specific questions: 
              (1) What is a sixth grader's day in school really like? (2) In what 
              ways do the programs provided for sixth graders differ, depending 
              on where the grade is located in the school system? and (3) How 
              does knowledge of the nature and needs of sixth graders match up 
              with the program actually provided? Sixth grades studied were initial, 
              middle, or terminal grades. Conclusions and recommendations make 
              up chapter 6. In appendices, related research is cited, methodology

              summarizes research relevant to the Austin Independent School District's 
              proposal to move sixth graders from an elementary school (K-6 or 
              K,4-6) to a middle school (6-8) grade grouping. A summary of the 
              evolution of middle-grade education is presented. Three areas affected 
              by grade organization are discussed: academic achievement, nonacademic 
              outcomes (self-concept and anxiety), and homogeneous grade groups. 
              The grade organization studies of various middle grade configurations 
              did not show any consistent effects one way or the other. References 
              to 36 studies are included. (SI)</p>

            <p>In the United 
              States, a &quot;two-tiered&quot; school system--elementary and secondary 
              education--is often spoken of, yet throughout this century the trend 
              has been toward a &quot;three tiered&quot; system--elementary, junior 
              high/intermediate/middle school, and high school. This paper reviews 
              literature and research regarding these trends, the advantages and 
              disadvantages of both systems, and the effects of grade organization 
              patterns on students. Particular emphasis is given to the middle/junior 
              high school system. The paper concludes with suggestions for changing 
              grade organization patterns. Appendixes include references, a chart 
              showing secondary grade organization patterns, and an outline of 
              advantages and disadvantages in the systems. (CB)</p>

            <p>This literature 
              review concerns the concept of alternative grade configurations 
              at the elementary level, in which elementary schools are subdivided 
              into primary (K-2) and intermediate (3-5) units. Because of the 
              paucity of literature on this concept, the major part of the report 
              focuses on the reorganization of the elementary schools of the South 
              Allegheny (Pennsylvania) school district. Although the K-2, 3-5 
              structure is often implemented in response to declining enrollment, 
              other educational benefits cited may include better concentration 
              on the educational and psychological needs of children in the two 
              age groups, though one research study showed no significant differences 
              in student achievement, attitude toward school, extracurricular 
              participation, or career aspiration. The goals of the South Allegheny 
              reorganization (in response to declining enrollment) were to equalize 
              class sizes to facilitate multilevel instruction in reading and 
              math, and to make better use of staff, school buildings, and instructional 
              resources. Each of these objectives is described in detail, along 
              with perceived disadvantages. An evaluative report revealed that 
              the new grade structure saved money and resulted in improved discipline, 
              student attitudes, and student interaction. Finally, literature 
              on the implementation process is briefly reviewed, emphasizing the 
              need for clear articulation between grade levels. Notes and references 
              are included. (TE)</p>
