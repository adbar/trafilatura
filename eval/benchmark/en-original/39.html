<p>Japan-United States relations were more uncertain in the early 1990s
        than at any time since World War II. As long-standing military allies
        and increasingly interdependent economic partners, Japan and the United
        States cooperated closely to build a strong, multifaceted relationship
        based on democratic values and interests in world stability and
        development. Japan-United States relations improved enormously in the
        1970s and 1980s, as the two societies and economies became increasingly
        intertwined. In 1990 their combined gross national product (GNP) totaled about one third of the world's GNP. Japan received
        about 11 percent of United States exports (a larger share than any other
        country except Canada), and the United States bought about 34 percent of
        Japan's exports. Japan had US$148 billion in direct
        investment in the United States in 1991, while the United States had
        more than US$17 billion invested in Japan. Some US$100 billion in United
        States government securities held by institutions in Japan helped
        finance much of the United States budget deficit. Economic exchanges
        were reinforced by a variety of scientific, technical, tourist, and
        other exchanges. Each society continued to see the other as its main
        ally in Asia and the Pacific. Certain developments in the late 1980s
        damaged bilateral relations. Nevertheless, public opinion surveys
        continued to reveal that substantial majorities of Japanese and
        Americans believed that the bilateral relationship was vital to both
        countries.
        <p>Growing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing
        circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a
        crisis in Japan-United States relations in the late 1980s. United States
        government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the
        relationship but warned that there was a need for &quot;a new conceptual
        framework.&quot; The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> publicized a series of
        lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late
        1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United
        States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or
        appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media
        opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on
        US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with
        preserving a close Japan-United States relationship. It warned of a
        &quot;new orthodoxy&quot; of &quot;suspicion, criticism and considerable
        self- justification,&quot; which it said was endangering the fabric of
        Japan- United States relations.
        <p>Three sets of factors stand out as the most important in explaining
        the challenges facing Japan-United States relations. They are economic,
        political-military, and domestic in nature.
        <p>The relative economic power of Japan and the United States was
        undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went
        well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with
        Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion
        annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and
        budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the
        middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of
        Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency
        gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make
        important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was
        the main international creditor.
        <p>Japan's growing investment in the United States--it was the second
        largest investor after Britain--led to complaints from some American
        constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to
        use its economic power to invest in the high- technology products in
        which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United
        States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many
        Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and
        business debt and a low savings rate.
        <p>In the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe
        and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal
        political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United
        States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the
        Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the
        security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have
        priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United
        States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common
        dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong
        Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed
        its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its
        forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific,
        Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant.
        <p>Increasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan-
        United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as
        deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the
        Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Ironically, some
        United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's
        potential military power in check and under the supervision of the
        United States.
        <p>The post-Cold War environment strengthened the relative importance of
        economic prowess over military power as the major source of world
        influence in the early 1990s. This shift affected the perceived relative
        standing of Japan, the United States, and other powers. Increasingly,
        Japan was expected to shoulder international aid and economic
        responsibilities that in the past were discharged by the United States
        and other Western countries.
        <p>The declining Soviet threat, the rising power of the Japanese
        economy, increasingly close United States interaction (and related
        disputes) with Japan, and other factors led by 1990 to a decided shift
        in United States opinion about Japan and to less marked but nonetheless
        notable shifts in Japanese opinion. In the United States, this shift was
        reflected in questions about which was the more serious, the military
        threat from the Soviet Union or the economic challenge from Japan. In a
        series of polls in 1989 and 1990, most respondents considered the
        challenge from Japan the more serious. Similarly, poll data from early
        1990 showed that most Japanese considered negative United States
        attitudes toward Japan a reflection of United States anger at
        &quot;America's slipping economic position.&quot; Meanwhile, Japanese
        opinion was showing greater confidence in Japan's ability to handle its
        own affairs without constant reference--as in the past--to the United
        States. Japan's belief in United States reliability as a world leader
        also lessened.
        <p>In both countries, new or &quot;revisionist&quot; views of the Japan-
        United States relationship were promoted. In Japan some commentators
        argued that the United States was weak, dependent on Japan, and unable
        to come to terms with world economic competition. They urged Japan to
        strike out on a more independent course. In the United States, prominent
        commentators warned of a Japanese economic juggernaut, out of control of
        the Japanese government, which needed to be &quot;contained&quot; by the
        United States.
        <p>At the same time, it was easy to overstate the changes in opinion in
        both countries. The Japanese still considered the United States
        positively as their closest friend, the principal guardian of their
        external security, their most important economic partner and market, and
        the exemplar of a life-style that had much to offer--and much to envy.
        Moreover, the vast majority of Americans still viewed Japan positively,
        had high respect for Japanese accomplishments, and supported the United
        States defense commitment to Japan.
        <p>In the years after World War II, Japan's relations with the United
        States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of
        the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the
        legal basis of which was laid down in the peace treaty signed by
        forty-eight Allied nations and Japan, was initially largely nominal,
        because in the early postoccupation period Japan required direct United
        States economic assistance. A favorable Japanese balance of payments
        with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of
        United States military and aid spending in Japan.
        <p>The Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the
        disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and
        trade with the United States expanded. Self-confidence grew as the
        country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining
        economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for
        greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and
        1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude
        toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan
        and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the
        Ryukyu Islands.
        <p>The government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating
        dissociation from the United States against the realities of the need
        for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return
        of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the Ogasawara
        Islands), the United States as early as 1953 voluntarily relinquished
        its control of the Amami group of islands at the northern end of the
        Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return
        Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for
        an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty.
        Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the
        Diet in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan.
        <p>Bilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and
        the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in
        Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet
        for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate
        over the Japan-United States relationship and the occasion for violence
        in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage.
        It was finally approved by the House of Representatives on May 20. Japan
        Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to
        prevent the LDP deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly
        removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students
        and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit
        to Japan by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the
        resignation of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, but not before the treaty
        was passed by default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed
        to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house
        approval.
        <p>Under the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each
        other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese
        administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come
        to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally
        forbidden to send armed forces overseas. In particular, the constitution
        forbids the maintenance of &quot;land, sea, and air forces.&quot; It
        also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of &quot;the threat or
        use of force as a means of settling international disputes&quot;.
        Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their
        &quot;self-defense&quot; forces overseas, even for peace-keeping
        purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu
        Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed
        attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take
        appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior
        consultation between the two governments before any major change
        occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in
        Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a
        ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by
        either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further
        development of international cooperation and on improved future economic
        cooperation.
        <p>Both countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise,
        under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories
        acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968 the United States
        returned the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima) to Japanese
        administration control. In 1969 the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's
        security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan
        political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime
        Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint
        communiqué signed by him and President Richard M. Nixon, announced the
        United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June
        1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an
        agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.
        <p>The Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the
        security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question
        meant that, two major political issues in Japan-United States relations
        were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese
        government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his
        forthcoming visit to the People's Republic of China. Many Japanese were
        chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with
        Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The
        following month, the government was again surprised to learn that,
        without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent
        surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to
        the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further
        strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation
        of the Japanese yen.
        <p>These events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in
        relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was
        not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres,
        although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues
        between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived
        from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to
        its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to
        stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits
        with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in
        trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export
        surplus.
        <p>The United States withdrawal from Indochina in 1975 and the end of
        the Second Indochina War meant that the question of Japan's role in the
        security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became
        central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. United States
        dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975
        when Secretary of Defense James A. Schlesinger publicly stigmatized
        Japan as a passive defense partner.
        <p>United States pressures continued and intensified, particularly as
        events in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East after 1979 caused the
        United States to relocate more than 50 percent of its naval strength
        from East Asian waters to the Indian Ocean. Japan was repeatedly pressed
        not only to increase its defense expenditures and build up its
        antisubmarine and naval patrol capabilities but also to play a more
        active and positive security role generally.
        <p>The Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations
        and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for
        a more rapid buildup of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). It steadily
        increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated
        its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United
        States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan
        formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the
        framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for
        under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new
        Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which
        military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating
        to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan.
        <p>On the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by
        agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on
        products whose influx into the United States was creating political
        problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese
        color television exports to the United States was signed, following the
        pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports
        to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as
        disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development
        of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on
        certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and
        liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within
        Japan.
        <p>To respond to the call, from its allies and from within the country
        as well, for a greater and more responsible role in the world, Japan
        developed what Ohira Masayoshi, after he became prime minister in
        December 1978, called a &quot;comprehensive security and defense
        strategy to safeguard peace.&quot; Under this policy, Japan sought to
        place its relations with the United States on a new footing--one of
        close cooperation but on a more reciprocal and autonomous basis, and on
        a global scale.
        <p>This policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical
        Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty
        hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of
        international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil
        companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available
        when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action
        brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government
        &quot;insensitivity&quot; for allowing the oil purchases and led to a
        Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran
        in concert with other United States allies.
        <p>Following that incident, the Japanese government took greater care to
        support United States international policies designed to preserve
        stability and promote prosperity. Japan was prompt and effective in
        announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following
        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in
        response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility
        for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United
        States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF.
        <p>A qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world
        affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime
        Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Officials of the Ronald Reagan
        administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to
        develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their
        common security and international outlook. Nakasone reassured United
        States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat,
        closely coordinated policies with the United States toward such Asian
        trouble spots as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked
        cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The
        Japanese government welcomed the increase of United States forces in
        Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF,
        and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the
        threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate
        closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's
        term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in
        the late 1980s made it difficult for newly elected President George Bush
        to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan
        years.
        <p>A specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United
        States included its quick response to the United States call for greater
        host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of
        Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s. The currency
        realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan,
        which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing
        to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness
        to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries
        considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United
        States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's &quot;strategic
        aid&quot; to countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Jamaica.
        Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's pledges of support for East European and
        Middle Eastern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness
        to share greater responsibility for world stability.
        <p>Despite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the
        Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States
        policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from
        large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were
        seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of
        course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation.
        Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect
        tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) was
        subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the
        positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because
        of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction
        of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host
        nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to
        Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to
        join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an
        indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to
        cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese
        leaders at home or abroad.
        <p>The main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s
        was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan
        to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic
        practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A common
        pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political
        pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by
        greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two
        types--those representing inefficient or &quot;declining&quot;
        producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if
        faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries
        that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition
        until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with
        domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States,
        the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic
        bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new
        industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects
        of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be
        dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one
        market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and
        subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States.
        <p>During the 1970s and 1980s, United States administrations had favored
        an issue-by-issue approach in negotiating such economic disputes with
        Japan. This approach ostensibly limited the areas of dispute. But it
        resulted in widespread negative publicity, at a time when changing
        economic and security circumstances were causing both countries to
        reevaluate the relationship. Notable outpourings of United States
        congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the
        disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated
        machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which reportedly
        allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid United States
        detection, and the United States congressional debate in 1989 over the
        Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter aircraft--the
        FSX--for Japan's Air Self- Defense Force.
        <p>A new approach was added in 1989. The so-called Structural
        Impediments Initiative was a series of talks designed to deal with
        domestic structural problems limiting trade on both sides. After several
        rounds of often contentious talks, agreements were reached in April and
        July 1990 that promised major changes in such sensitive areas as
        Japanese retailing practices, land use, and investment in public works.
        The United States pledged to deal more effectively with its budget
        deficit and to increase domestic savings. United States supporters saw
        the Structural Impediments Initiative talks as addressing fundamental
        causes of Japan-United States economic friction. Skeptics pointed to
        them as ways for officials to buy time and avoid an acute crisis in
        Japan-United States relations. The Bill Clinton administration decided
        to end the Structural Impediments Initiative in the summer of 1993 as a
        framework for dealing with United States-Japan bilateral relations.</p>
