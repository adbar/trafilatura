  <p><strong>Summary:</strong> <em>How your church can have a volunteer team of

  <h4><span style='font-family:Arial;color:#990000'><font size="4"><img src="../fractals/the%20eternal%20prayer.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">Some 
    Statistics</font></span></h4>
  <p  align=left style='text-align:left'><font size="4">Worldwide 
    Internet Population:</font></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>445.9 million (eMarketer)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>533 million (Computer Industry Almanac)</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font size="4">Projection 
    for 2004:</font></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>709.1 million (eMarketer)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>945 million (Computer Industry Almanac)</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='text-align:left'><font size="4">Online 
    Language Populations (September 2002)</font></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>English 36.5%; Chinese 10.9%, Japanese 9.7%, 
    Spanish 7.2%, German 6.7%, Korean 4.5%, <br>
    Italian 3.8%, French 3.5%, Portuguese 3.0%, Russian 2.9%, Dutch 2.0% (Source: 
    Global Reach)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>From the above statistics it is clear that 
    the Internet is no longer predominantly an English speaking medium and that 
    Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean now occupy a significant 
    portion of cyber-space along with major European languages such as Spanish., 
    Portuguese and French.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>There are over 275 million Internet searches 
    each day and 80% of all Internet sessions begin at a search engine (Internetstatistics.com). 
    Religion is one of the main topics people search for. Pew Internet surveys 
    found that 28 million Americans get religion information online, that three 
    million do so daily, and that 25 % of net users search for religion-related 
    topics. Barna Research estimates that up to 50 million Americans may worship 
    solely over the Internet by 2010. There is every indication that the Internet 
    is a major source of religious information where people of many cultures and 
    languages collect their spiritual facts and opinions in private. Thus it’s 
    a place where missionaries must be. </span></p>
  <h3><img src="../aibi/flydove.gif" width="134" height="99">What Is The Role 
    Of A Local Church?</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Local churches can create a Cybermissions 
    Project Team (CPT) that uses the church website, chat rooms and email to reach 
    a specific ethnic group for Christ. A well-run cybermissions website can see 
    three people a day or about 1100 people a year make commitments to Jesus as 
    Lord and Savior. </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>This is because the website is a “perpetual 
    evangelist” that works away 24/7 witnessing to seekers about Christ. The Internet 
    is seeker-driven. People using the Internet are seeking information via search 
    engines and links on other sites. When people arrive at your website its not 
    an accident. They have typed a query into a search engine and arrived there. 
    People not interested in God simply don’t arrive at your church website – 
    they end up somewhere else, reading the weather or the news. So virtually 
    100% of the people you minister to will already have some level of interest. 
    This makes evangelism so much easier! You can witness, via the Internet 24/7 
    to people who are already interested in finding out about God!</span></p>
  <h3>OK  how do I start?</h3>
<br>
  <font color="#000066">1.  <span style='font-weight:normal;
'><strong>Form a small group</strong> of say 6 to 8 people which should include 
  a few “techie” computer types, a few “bible” types and someone with enthusiasm 
  for missions.</span></font><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-weight:normal;'>The 
  pastor does not need to lead the group, he/she can just give it some guidelines 
  and get a monthly report. The group should be led by someone with a passion 
  for missions on the Internet. The group can fit into the church structure in 
  a similar way to creative ministry teams.</span></font> 
  <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial'>2. 
    <strong>Read the articles</strong> on cybermissions at <a href="http://www.aibi.ph/missions/">http://www.aibi.ph/missions/</a> 
    for some ideas to get you started. </span></font></p>
  <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span style='font-family:Arial'>3. 
     <strong>Get some web space</strong>. You need a domain name “yourchurch.com” 
    and some space on a server. We use <a href="http://www.christianwebhost.com">ChristianWebHost.com</a> 
    and have found them to be both affordable and reliable.</span></font></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font color="#000066">4. </font></span><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
     style='font-family:Arial'><strong>Pray about what people group </strong> 
    you should be ministering to. For a list of the 43 nations most suitable for 
    a cybermissions strategy <a href="cybermissions_target_nations.htm">click 
    here.</a> </span></font>Then go to our<a href="../aibi/misslinks.htm"> mission 
    links</a> site and do some research on your chosen nation at any of the mission 
    portal sites listed there e.g <a href="http://www.strategicnetwork.org">strategicnetwork.org</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class=Section1><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>5. <strong>Decide on an initial strategy</strong> 
  (you can tweak it later) and start designing the website. Use the articles in 
  point 2 above for some ideas.</span></font></div>
<div class=Section1>
  <p><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
     style='font-family:Arial'>6. <strong>Spend at least four hours a week</strong> 
    working on the website and improving it. </span></font></p>
  <p><span style="font-family: Arial"><font color="#000066">7. </font></span><font color="#000066" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><span
     style='font-family:Arial'><strong>Reply to the emails</strong> that come 
    in promptly and start ministering to people in your target group.</span></font> 
  </p>
  <p>8. <strong>Become a member</strong> of <a href="http://www.cybermissions.org">Cybermissions.Org</a> 
    and hang out with other people doing the same thing - <em><strong>its free.</strong></em> 
    (Cybermissions.Org will open officially on 12th August 2003 as a web portal 
    for cybermissionaries.)</p>

<div class=Section1> 
  <h3><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>How Much Does Running A Cybermissions 
    Project Team Cost?</span></b></h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>You will probably pay around $19.95 a year 
    for the domain name.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Then around $10 a month for reliable ad-free 
    hosting and $29.95 a month for broadband access at your home or church office. 
    ($480 per annum)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Then work on replacing a computer every two 
    years so - $1000 p.a.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Then maybe you want some expensive software 
    - $1500 a year</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>And you do some online advertising at $150 
    a month - $1800 </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>Total costs = $4800 per annum. Or around 
    $5000 per annum for a well-equipped active evangelistic outreach that may 
    well bring between 100 to 1100 people to Christ.</span></p>
  <h3>On A Shoe-String Budget?</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:Arial'>You can start for  $1000 per annum, $500 
    for the basics, (website, domain name, broadband) and $500 for extras. For 
    good free open-source software go to <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net">http://www.sourceforge.net</a></span></p>
