<h3>the incremental movement toward abolition</h3>

<p>Here is some commentary on the question. It's an excerpt from 48 Rutgers Law
Review 397, 448-468, ANIMAL RIGHTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE  Copyright 1995 by
Gary L. Francione. Portions of this article are taken from the book Rain
Without Thunder. Footnotes are omitted.</p>

<p>CRITERION #1: An Incremental Change Must Constitute a Prohibition</p>

<p>...Thus the first criterion for any incremental change, beyond the
incremental education of the public about the need to abolish
institutionalized animal exploitation, is that it must prohibit some
reasonably identifiable behavior. This prohibition must also correlate with
the ability of the animal to claim (through a representative) the protection
of the right.</p>

<p>The requirement that there be a prohibition, and not merely a regulation
that requires "humane" treatment, is sometimes phrased as requiring the
"abolition" of a particular practice. Although this is a correct description
of the matter, it can cause confusion by equating the abolition of
institutionalized animal exploitation with incremental measures that, it is
hoped, will lead to that abolition. On the first level of moral theory,
animal rights theory is clearly "abolitionist" in that its long-term goal is
the complete eradication of institutionalized animal exploitation. What we
are examining now is whether there are adequate criteria that can be used to
identify incremental means to the long-term goal.</p>

<p>To say that the incremental means must themselves be "abolitionist" is
correct if the definition includes prohibitions against reasonably
identifiable conduct which, if engaged in, would constitute a failure to
respect a particular animal interest. But these incremental means are by
definition not "abolitionist" in the sense that no one incremental
prohibition will effect the long-term goal of ending animal slavery. In
order to avoid confusion, it is better to reserve the use of "abolition" for
the long-term goal of rights theory, and "prohibition" as one criterion of
incremental measures that seek to realize that long-term goal....</p>

<p>CRITERION #2: There Must Be a Prohibition of an Identifiable Activity That
is Constitutive of the Exploitative Institution

<p>Consider the following proposals:

<p>Proposal 1: Reduce the number of hens confined in a battery cage (usually
floor space is a twelve inch square) from four hens to three hens.

<p>Proposal 2: Criminalize the use of animals in drug addiction experiments.

<p>These proposals cannot be distinguished using the first criterion alone,
because, for the reasons stated above, both of these can be considered to
involve prohibitions. Although Proposal 2 accords more with the notion of a
prohibition, Proposal 1 can be conceptualized as a prohibition on keeping
four chickens in a cage.</p>

<p>This is not to say, however, that there are no distinctions between Proposal
1 and Proposal 2. With respect to the criminalization of the use of animals
in a certain type of experiment, a particular activity that is constitutive
of the general practice of vivisection has been stopped.</p>

<p>...[E]ven if the elimination of the battery cage and the substitution of the
small hen house constitute a prohibition of an activity (i.e., the use of
the battery cage), that proposal implicates the problem that the change
nevertheless continues to sanction the exploitation of the hens, albeit in a
different form.</p>

<p>CRITERION #3: The Prohibition of a Constitutive Activity Must Recognize and
Respect a Non-Institutional Animal Interest</p>

<p>Although there is some controversy over whether animals can be said to have
"interests," as has been discussed elsewhere, for good reasons, most people,
including those who exploit animals, regard nonhumans as having a wide range
of interests. The law supposedly protects animal interests. The problem is
that for the most part, these interests are those that facilitate the
exploitation of animals for a particular property use. For example, the law
protects the interests of animals used in experiments to the extent
necessary to ensure that the animal produces data of the quality considered
acceptable by research scientists. Indeed, those who support the use of
animals in experiments assure the public that "only those animals that are
cared for properly will be good research subjects,"  and that the federal
Animal Welfare Act and other sources of regulation provide for the requisite
care. In this sense, each form of institutionalized exploitation will have
rules about the "humane" care of animals that are tailored to that
particular use of animal property and that reflect the particular concerns
of that exploitative activity.</p>

<p>To the extent that we seek the incremental eradication of the property
status of animals, it is necessary that there is a corresponding recognition
of the interests of animals in not being regarded as property, or, as Regan
would say, in not being treated exclusively as a means to human ends. ...To
eradicate the property status of animals, there must be a recognition of an
interest that is noninstitutional, or that is not simply an interest that
ensures the animal is used "wisely" in a context of exploitation. It is only
through recognition of extra or noninstitutional interests that incremental
eradication of property status can be achieved; recognition of institutional
interests, such as the interest of a turkey destined for slaughter in being
fed, merely reinforces and supports the property status of animals. ...</p>

<p>CRITERION #4: Animal Interests Cannot Be "Tradable"</p>

<p>...If there is to be an incremental eradication of the property status of
animals, then there must be a recognition that animals have interests that
go beyond those interests that must be respected if we are to exploit
animals efficiently. And, following the second salient assumption of animal
rights theory, these non-institutional interests cannot be tradable just
because the aggregation of consequences indicates that the trade is
justified to secure the human "benefit." Indeed, animals are property
precisely because animals have no interests (beyond those that must be
observed if the animals are to serve their "purpose" as our property) that
are safe from being balanced away as soon as some human "benefit" is
identified.</p>

<p>In one sense, this criterion seeks to ensure that the incremental
eradication of property status is indeed an incremental "assembly" of
personhood status for nonhumans through the recognition of the inherent
value of animals. At present, we do not recognize animals as having any
value except for their value to us. For example, philosopher Joseph Raz
claims that although animals may have some value apart from their
instrumental use to people, animals cannot have inherent value because any
value of the animal ultimately derives from the animal's contribution to the
happiness and well-being of some human or humans, who do have inherent
value.  Raz's views are representative of many people's views. The fourth
criterion ensures that each incremental move provides for and protects some
notion of the inherent value of animals.</p>

<p>In one sense, this criterion could be said to address the enforceability of
protection for recognized interests. One could say that under slavery as
practiced in the United States, there were some laws that seemed to
recognize that slaves had interests other than ones directly related to
keeping a slave alive and fit for whatever purpose the slave was intended.
For the most part, however, these interests were ignored whenever they
conflicted with the interests of the master whose property rights were held
to outweigh the slave's interests. If animal interests are to be taken
seriously, then, to the extent that the law regulates the use of animal
property beyond what is necessary to exploit the animal property, that
regulation must be held as eliminating the property right to the extent
necessary to protect the interest. Otherwise, the victory for animals will
be illusory; as soon as the rights of human property owners are triggered,
the animal interest will be ignored.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the interest of the animal must be seen explicitly as an
interest that is to be protected as would a true "right" within the legal
system. The interest would not be a "right" in the full sense in that since
animals would not yet possess the basic right not to be regarded as property
(they would still be used for food and in experiments), they would have
nonbasic rights that could be said to be building blocks of the basic right
not to be property. These nonbasic rights must, however, be treated as
though they were rights in the sense that they will be regarded as
protecting interests that are not subject to interest balancing.</p>

<p>To protect animal interests in this manner would require a very deliberate
and intentional recognition of a type of legal norm that our legal system
does not yet recognize: a norm that functions like a true right in that it
recognizes an interest that cannot be balanced away, but that is held by a
being who has not yet achieved the status of being a holder of the basic
right not to be regarded exclusively as a means to an end. Indeed, every
time we recognize such a right, we move away from treating the being
exclusively as a means to human ends; the problem is that the being's most
fundamental interests in not being eaten or used in experiments or kept in a
zoo have not yet been recognized. These incremental measures may be seen,
however, as recognizing pieces of the basic right not to be regarded as
property. So, although these interests represent nonbasic rights in one
sense (the animal does not yet by definition have the basic right of not
being property), the interests are more properly regarded as "parts" of the
basic right of animals not to be treated exclusively as means to human ends.</p>

<p>..In order to recognize that animals have such interests, it is necessary
that these interests be understood as trumping the interests of property
owners. And in order to be effective, it would be necessary for the legal
system to recognize that it is animals who hold this interest, and not their
owners or government agencies, such as the USDA, which protects only
those animal interests that make animals property in the first place. It
would be necessary to recognize that animals (or, more properly
speaking, the guardians of animals) have standing to articulate these
interests against property owners, which would functionally require that
some sort of guardian be recognized.</p>

<p>Because animals are regarded as property, and property is, by definition and
several hundred years of accepted understanding, that which cannot have
legal relations with persons or other property, courts have developed
doctrines that preclude animals or their surrogates from articulating their
interests in courts of law and before regulatory agencies. This exclusion is
based on the supposed inability (in terms of the power of the court) to
adjudicate claims made by property or those who purport to represent that
property. So, if the ... non-institutional interests of animals are to be
non-tradable, then those interests, which must be seen as recognizing
"minitrumps" of the property rights of animal owners, must be protected by
the legal system. This will require that animal interests have legal
standing and that some human actor (and this could be the police) have
standing to articulate those claims before the appropriate body. This is, of
course, not a new idea. In Should Trees Have Standing? -- Toward Legal
Rights for Natural Objects, Christopher Stone argued that the inherent value
of nonhumans could be recognized and protected by guardians just as are the
rights (basic rights and nonbasic rights) of children or the mentally
disabled.</p>

<p>CRITERION #5: The Prohibition Should Not Substitute an Alternative, and
Supposedly More "Humane" Form of Exploitation</p>

<p>This fifth criterion follows from both aspects of rights theory identified
at the outset of this section: that rights theory requires eradication of
the property status of animals and that the right of animals not to be
regarded as property cannot be compromised for consequential reasons. In
many respects, this fifth criterion is the most significant of the group
because it often will be the most helpful in determining whether a proposed
incremental measure is consistent with rights theory, although, like the
other criteria, this one is not exact and will not provide an easy answer in
all cases. But then, the idea is to try to make a morally informed decision,
and not necessarily one that is always right.</p>

<p>The fifth criterion holds that it is inconsistent with rights theory to
treat some animals exclusively as means to the ends of others, or as
property, in order to secure some benefit that it is hoped will eventually
secure a higher moral status for other animals. This is a serious problem
for the new welfarist who purports to endorse the long-term goal of animal
rights by using short-term welfarist reforms as a means to the end of
abolition of institutionalized exploitation.</p>

<p>The new welfarist disregards the inherent value of some animals in order to
secure a benefit for other animals. For example, the federal Animal Welfare
Act provides that animals  may be used in biomedical experiments as long as
their use is "humane" and they are not forced to suffer "unnecessarily." The
new welfarists, who supported the 1985 amendments to the Act, believe that
the Act will itself reduce animal suffering, but more importantly, that laws
like the Act are "stepping stones" to the future recognition and respect of
animals other than the ones whose interests are now being ignored. This
Article argued earlier that there is simply no way to determine whether laws
like the Act actually reduce animal suffering, and that, given the
structural defects of welfare theory generally, such laws will generally be
held only to require that conduct that facilitates the use of the animal as
property. Apart from the rather puzzling logic of how we get to a
non-property status of animals by persistent reinforcement of the property
paradigm, there is something objectionable on a theoretical level when a
rights advocate explicitly endorses the property status of animals as a way
of eradicating that status on an incremental basis.</p>

<p>...So, for example, a complete prohibition on the use of chimpanzees in
certain procedures can reasonably be said to constitute the prohibition of a
constitutive activity, but to the extent that the advocate urges or accepts
that other animals, such as dogs, should be used instead...such a rule would
violate the fundamental proscription against speciesism.

<p>In order to understand more fully the point of this fifth criterion,
consider the following example: animal advocates propose to lobby for a law
the preamble of which explicitly recognizes that animals have moral
interests and the current configuration of battery hens per cage disrespects
those moral interests. The body of the law provides that in recognition of
the interests that hens have, no more than two shall be placed in battery
cages, and these cages shall be enlarged to provide 196 inches of floorspace
rather than 144 inches. The egg industry objects to this arrangement
vehemently as it is "unnecessary" to maximize the value of animal property
and will, in fact, impose a very significant cost on the ownership of animal
property in this context. The law provides that this interest must be
protected irrespective of the economic consequences and contains penalties
to ensure that the interests are not recognized subject to complete
defeasance through a claim of human "benefit."</p>

<p>The traditional welfarist would undoubtedly support this measure because it
will, in the welfarist's view, reduce animal suffering. The new welfarist,
who seeks as a long-term goal the abolition of animal exploitation, will
also undoubtedly support this, not only because it will supposedly reduce
suffering, but because it is a "stepping stone" or "springboard" into
abolition at some future time. The new welfarist and the traditional
welfarist have the same view -- that the measure will reduce suffering --
but the new welfarist, unlike the traditional welfarist, believes that
because the measure will reduce suffering, it will act as an incremental
measure on the road to the long-term goal.</p>

<p>The animal rights advocate first dismisses the view that avoiding pain and
suffering are the only interests that animals (human or nonhuman) have. If
pain and suffering were the only relevant moral interests, then what would
prevent us from using small numbers of "undesirable" humans to eradicate
large amounts of human pain and suffering? Obviously, although we all have
strong interests in avoiding pain and suffering, we do limit the ways in
which pain and suffering can be alleviated so as to respect other
interests -- such as the rights of humans (and nonhumans) -- as well.
Second, the rights advocate dismisses the new welfarist view, also
articulated by Singer, that a measure that reduces pain and suffering will
lead to incremental achievement of the long-term goal of equal consideration
for equal interests (Singer) or the abolition of all institutionalized
exploitation (Regan) simply because it supposedly reduces pain and
suffering. The rights advocate knows that some measures that supposedly
reduce pain and suffering will do nothing more than assure that animals
receive protection that is consistent with their status as property, and
that facilitates their use as particular types of property.</p>

<p>The rights advocate begins by asking whether the proposal contains a
prohibition or a regulation, and concludes that the proposal prohibits
keeping more than two hens in the cage. She is unclear as to whether, even
if the proposal is a prohibition, it constitutes a prohibition of an
activity that is constitutive of the overall form of exploitation. She errs
in favor of regarding the measure as prohibiting a constitutive activity.
She is clear, however, that the proposal provides for the recognition of an
interest that is extra-institutional in that it provides for the recognition
of an interest that is not tied to the property status of the hens. The
proposal recognizes that the hens have inherent value beyond their status as
property, which would justify only that level of regulation that facilitated
animal use. Moreover, the proposal provides that these interests cannot be
traded away and constitute proto-rights.</p>

<p>The problem with the proposal is that it is, on its face, not only
consistent with the status of animals as property that, as a general matter,
lacks inherent value, but does so in a way that explicitly trades away the
basic right of the hens not to be property in favor of a recognition of
moral status that falls short of recognition of the basic right, or the
complete protection of some interest that the animal has in, for example,
bodily movement. By agreeing to the two-hen arrangement, animal advocates
are trying to achieve proto-rights while at the same time endorsing an
alternative form of exploitation -- two hens in a cage -- that is supposedly
more "humane."</p>

<p>In the present case, it seems reasonable to say that the interest involved
is the interest that the hens have -- all of them -- in not being in the
battery cage in the first place and in having freedom of movement that is
appropriate to the species. To the extent that the proposal recognizes and
respects that interest, then the prohibition arguably does not substitute
another form of exploitation and is acceptable. That is, assume that a
prohibition abolishes the battery cage entirely and replaces it with a
rearing system that accommodates all of the hen's interests in freedom of
movement and thereby fully recognizes the interest of the hen's bodily
integrity. Such a state of affairs may be another way of saying that the
prohibition ends a particular form of exploitation that has violated a
particular non-institutional, non-tradable interest that we have now decided
to respect. But this sort of substitution differs considerably from merely
removing two of the hens from the cage in that although we have not yet
abolished the institutionalized exploitation, the substitution eliminates
the exploitation involved in the confinement system through a full
recognition of the interest of the hens in their freedom of movement.</p>

<p>In any event, any substitution of exploitation raises serious questions for
the rights advocate. If the incremental eradication of the property status
of animals is going to be consistent with rights theory, it is important
that proposed measures not substitute one form of exploitation for another,
supposedly more "humane" form of exploitation. Oftentimes, the alternative
form of exploitation will provide in general terms for "humane" treatment,
which then feeds the whole matter right back through the mechanisms of legal
welfarism which, as argued before, are structurally defective and
systematically devalue animal interests. But even if the substitute form of
exploitation is more definite (i.e., there shall be no more than two birds
per cage), and even if the proposal recognizes that the animals have some
inherent value that justifies the recognition of a non-institutional,
non-tradable interest, that recognition comes at the expense of endorsing
another form of exploitation that rests on the legitimacy of the status of
animals as property. This sacrifices the moral right of the animal not to be
property for a proto-right that is designed to effect the incremental
eradication of property status. The substitution of exploitation raises
issues of moral conflict with rights theory, and incoherence in light of the
fundamental assumptions of that theory.</p>

<p>This discussion does serve, however, to demonstrate that as a practical
matter, certain campaigns will be difficult for animal rights advocates to
pursue if they agree with this fifth criterion. It seems that the rights
advocate really has no choice but to condemn any form of substitute
exploitation, unless that alternative arrangement completely eradicates an
activity constitutive of animal exploitation through the full recognition of
relevant animal interests. The animal advocate must not herself suggest an
alternative, and must not agree to any alternative offered by the exploiter.
To do either would involve the rights advocate sacrificing the basic right
of animals not to be property in order to secure a less-than-basic
proto-right that, while it does recognize and respect that animals have
person-like interests that transcend their status as property, is achieved
at the cost of reinforcing the notion that a "better" system of animal
slavery is acceptable. These considerations would militate in favor of
conducting the sort of campaign that may not succeed (at least initially),
but that will have a potentially powerful effect on educating members of the
public about animal exploitation. And in many respects, such education,
whether sought directly in the classroom or as part of a militant campaign
such as one that supports a law to demand the end of the egg battery and
that urges no substitute form of exploitation (rather than a reactionary and
conservative welfarist campaign to make the matters more "humane" for the
hens) is probably the best thing that the animal rights advocate can do at
this stage of history in any event.</p>

<H3>
Animal rights vs. Animal Welfare - An introduction
to the Controversy</H3>

<H4>
<I>by Dietrich von Haugwitz</I></H4>
Many people who have only recently joined the Animal Rights/Animal Protection
Movement are puzzled why one issue seems to stir up a never-ending debate&nbsp;
within the movement.&nbsp; The following is designed to acquaint the reader
with the reasons why "animal rights" and "animal welfare" are two very
different concepts, even though they both concern the well being of animals.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>In most counties throughout the U.S. we find organizations with names
like Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA), Animal Protection
Society (APS) and Humane Society (HS).
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>These should be viewed as "animal welfare" organizations.&nbsp; As
their names indicate, they are concerned with cruelty, with protection,
with humane treatment.&nbsp; And typically, their concern is for domestic
animals:
<BR>chiefly dogs and cats, but also horses, goats, rabbits, etc.

<P>The welfarist accepts certain traditional attitudes toward animals:
These are our animals; we own them, and we should be responsible owners.&nbsp;
Like a good shepherd, we should look after those in our charge; protect
them; treat them humanely.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>But for the welfarist there is a fundamental difference between animals
and people.&nbsp; People have rights, but with each such right come some
obligations.&nbsp; (I have a right to be protected from theft; but in turn
I have an obligation not to steal.)&nbsp; Animals can't reason; they can't
understand obligations, and so it would be absurd to give them rights.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>(Note that animal protection laws do NOT create legal rights for animals.&nbsp;
In the eyes of the law, animals are not "legal persons", they are property.&nbsp;
If I kill your dog, in the eyes of the law I have harmed YOU, not your
dog.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Animal welfare people accept this property status of animals.&nbsp;
Still, they differ widely on how much welfare animals are entitled to.&nbsp;
Even the cattle rancher, circus owner, or vivisector claims to be greatly
concerned with the welfare of his or her animals: "We avoid all unnecessary
pain and suffering; we observe the Humane Slaughter Act and the Animal
Welfare Act; and we truly care for our animals - or else they wouldn't
yield good meat, perform well in the circus, or yield good results in research."&nbsp;
Whereas animal-loving people in humane societies go much farther: they
see lots of unnecessary suffering in all those industries: Those laying
hens should be free running; those circus elephants are hurt during training;
and using those lab rabbits is unnecessary because safe cosmetics (unlike
medical discoveries) can be obtained without animals.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>For welfarists the bottom line is: We are opposed to cruelty;&nbsp;
we owe the animals kindness and compassion.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>How does that differ from the animal rights view?&nbsp; The difference
is fundamental.&nbsp; AR says: Kindness and compassion?&nbsp; That's all
very nice, but it misses the point.&nbsp; What we owe the animals is something
quite different:&nbsp; We owe them RESPECT and JUSTICE !&nbsp; (Put yourself
back into, say, the year 1830.&nbsp; There were the welfarist: We must
treat our slaves with great kindness and compassion.&nbsp; Nonsense!, said
the Abolitionists;
<BR>we must liberate them!&nbsp; Even if their lives might sometimes become
even harder, we must recognize that the entire institution is utterly immoral
and must be abolished.)
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>In this short overview, we cannot get into the philosophical difference
between the utilitarian AR view (Singer) and the strict rights view (Regan,
Rollin, ...).&nbsp; But both theories arrive essentially at the same bottom
line:&nbsp; The traditional line drawn between one species (human) and
all other species is irrational when it comes to morals.&nbsp; Species
membership is not morally relevant.&nbsp; We must give equal consideration
to the interests of all sentient animals, regardless of species.&nbsp;
Not to do so rests on nothing more than tradition.&nbsp; Animal rights
theorists
<BR>have advanced arguments that are very hard to refute; they show why
all differences between humans and non-humans - great as they may be! -
are morally irrelevant.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Therefore, animals must not be viewed as ours.&nbsp; They do not exist
for us. They are not our commodities, harvests, stock, game, objects of
amusement or education, specimens, or throw-away lab tools like rubber
<BR>gloves or test tubes.&nbsp; To regard them as our property, and to
encode this property status in our laws, is a case of "might makes right"
-- no more.&nbsp; It cannot be morally justified.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>As Regan points out, if humans have "independent value" (and most of
us accept that), then so do chimpanzees.&nbsp; To deny this would be irrational.
If something has "instrumental value", it may be used as a tool, for our
benefit.&nbsp; But individuals who have independent value must not be used
as if they&nbsp; were instruments.&nbsp; (Hence the abolition of human
slavery.)&nbsp; We must respect their rights not to be enslaved for our
benefit.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>So when we say that animals have some very basic rights (such as life,
liberty, and the pursuit of their happiness), we are talking of MORAL rights.&nbsp;
Before each of our existing legal rights were established, a
<BR>majority of people had felt strongly that a moral right existed. Campaigners
worked for the rights of racial minorities, of women, of children.&nbsp;
Animal rights campaigners now work for translating the moral
<BR>rights of animals into legal rights.

<P>So in the AR view, all institutions which enslave animals must be abolished!&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's an incredibly radical idea. It differs fundamentally from any version
of the animal welfare or protection view.&nbsp; While animal welfare people
work for improvements of the conditions in which animals are kept, animal
rights people challenge the right of owners to keep such animals.&nbsp;
One AR motto: We do not demand larger and cleaner cages; we demand empty
cages!
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>How to achieve this abolition?&nbsp; That's where there are very serious
differences with in the AR community, and they are appropriate topics for
internal debates.&nbsp; Should the emphasis be on legislative actions?
On education? On confrontations and "direct action"? Should we support
the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) ?
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>But another quarrel between two factions in the AR movement concerns
this:&nbsp; Should we work with welfare people on reforms?&nbsp; Some say:
by all means!&nbsp; Let's strengthen the Animal Welfare Act;&nbsp; let's
make the animal
<BR>care committees' minutes public; let's support the downers bill (collapsed
animals should not be dragged to slaughter); let's get rid of face branding
cattle; etc.&nbsp; NO!, says the other side.&nbsp; Reforms only legitimate
the exploiting industries; abolition will be much harder if the worst excesses
are legally removed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>To sum up:&nbsp; Each of us should search his or her soul as to what
the ultimate goal of our activities should be.&nbsp; Undoubtedly many animal
rightists will often work together with animal welfare people and with
environmental groups on certain efforts.&nbsp; But we should give a certain
structure to our own beliefs and convictions.&nbsp; Do we just want to
help animals here and there (perhaps because we are "animal lovers")? Obviously
there is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp; But if we want to commit ourselves
to this hard work, we will have to make up our minds about our ultimate
intent:&nbsp; reform or abolition? -->
