Electoral &amp; Constitutional Reform<br>
</font><font face="arial narrow" color="#c00000" size="+1">Issued 5th April,
2000, Adopted by the National Council, January 2000</font></p>
<p>[<i>*Note: The first section of Part B, Clause 2b,C is still in Official
Draft mode, and is subject to further discussion at the June 2000 Conference</i>]</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">Preamble:</font></h4>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">a/</font></b> The PLP proceeds from the
premise that major political, electoral and constitutional reforms are long
overdue in Australia and that they are not and will not be tackled by the major
parties. In developing a blueprint for change we prioritise an order in the
change process on the basis of urgency and achievability. Therefore, what
follows is an ambit package, eg. proportional representation for all Parliaments
is high on the list, followed by the abolition of state upper houses, followed
by the creation of a two-tier structure of elected government. Depending on the
changing preferences of the Australian people some stages may be speeded up,
collapsed or skipped altogether. What we present here is an overall concept for
change.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">b/ Our principal policies for a new
Republic are:</font></p>
</b>
<ul>
  <li>President: elected DIRECTLY by the people, with symbolic powers only:
  <li>Note: the Irish Presidential model provides a useful guide: strictly
    symbolic powers unlike the present powers of either the Monarch or
    Australian Governor-General. In addition, persons who have been members of
    any Parliament during the past 10 years cannot be candidates. Steps would be
    enforced to prevent expenditure by parties or business interests of large
    sums of money to distort the result of the poll.
  <li>A President is needed to perform a variety of ceremonial and legislative
    functions.
  <li>Two-tier system of elected government:<i> </i>National government and a
    much strengthened local government system, coupled with administrative local
    government regions
  <li>Proportional Representation: aimed to create greater diversity in
    Parliament
  <li>Improvement in the Quality of Political Executive Government, with
    consideration of a number of options for democratisation and broadening of
    cabinet government in Australia.
  <li>Fixed four-year parliamentary terms
  <li>A comprehensive Bill of Rights
  <li>Safeguards for: <b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">(a)</font></b> the
    environment;<font color="#00FFFF"> <font size="+1"><b>(b) </b></font></font>Indigenous
    Peoples' rights; <font color="#000080" size="+1"><b>(c)</b></font> other
    minority groups</li>
</ul>
<font color="#00FFFF"><b><font size="+1">c/</font></b> </font>PLP policy is
aimed at creating the Maximalist Republic, a Republic for the people, by the
people and of the people - as it should be! A mere change of ceremonial Head of
State would still leave Australia with a rigid and archaic constitution, an
outmoded political system and a grossly unequal society. This would be piecemeal
tinkering of the worst kind. The time has come to consider clear alternatives to
the federal form of government, the two-party system, the electoral system and
the scope of government. A Bill of Rights, constitutional protection of the
environment and a conciliatory settlement of indigenous rights need to be
incorporated in a Republican constitution.
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">d/</font></b> The PLP has adopted the
position that a sovereign people naturally have the unfettered right to rewrite
and replace their constitution if they believe this to be a requirement for
their survival, prosperity and improvement of their democracy. The PLP holds
that what has happened in Australia in recent years is like putting the cart
before the horse.</p>
<p>Neither major party has a program for significant constitutional and
political change.</p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF"><b><font size="+1">e/</font></b> </font>The notion that
a government can be enterprising - and enabling - itself is the antithesis of
the view that only private enterprise can deliver economic recovery, jobs and
future prosperity for Australia. Many other countries, even those with a
significant private sector, have entirely government-owned or jointly-owned
public corporations to run key industries, e.g. France and Norway. As the PLP is
of the view that Australia should aim at government enterprise rather than
privatisation it becomes imperative to build real quality and independence into
the Government and Parliaments and to ensure that Government and Parliaments
cease to be the servants of powerful multinational corporations and financiers
in the private sector.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">The reformist strategy is dealt with in
three sections:</font></p>
<p></b>SECTION 1: THE INADEQUACIES OF THE EXISTING POLITICAL SYSTEM;</p>
<p>SECTION 2: A MAXIMALIST MODEL FOR POLITICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN
AUSTRALIA;</p>
<p>SECTION 3: DRAFTING THE NEW CONSTITUTION, - CONSTITUTIONAL CONTINUITY, -
LAUNCHING THE NEW CONSTITUTION BY MEANS OF SECTION 128.</p>
<h3><font face="arial narrow" color="#c00000" size="+2">SECTION 1 The
Inadequacies of the Existing Political System</font></h3>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">a/</font></b> The kind of question which
Australians are now increasingly increasingly asking themselves in relation to
the Republic is: What kind of a Republic do we really want? If Australians can
reconstruct their political system to meet the demands of a society vastly
different from Federation in 1900, having greatly advanced technology at its
disposal and possessing superior transport and communication systems as well as
physical resources, how will they do it? Would there still be any need for a
federal system at all? Or would it be a huge hindrance to effective government?
Would there still be need a for some 830 politicians? Should they introduce a
two-tiered system of elected Government and enable the majority party or
coalition to select the Ministry from outside Parliament rather than appoint
career politicians? Surely the issue is no longer whether Australia should be a
Republic OR continue to be an outpost of a rather shaky constitutional monarchy
which has little interest in her distant Dominion. Improving the processes of
Government in Australia, steeped in 200 years British colonial and Westminster
traditions, is a task habitually avoided by both major parties. Unless it's done
Australia may no longer in business on account of its antiquated constitution
and political system. More likely it will be governed by the Boards of Directors
of foreign Multi National Enterprises through a comprador class of well-paid
compliant Australian managers and politicians. That trend is unmistakable
already. The PLP intends to create a real democracy in Australia.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">b/</font></b> The domination by two major
parties has led to an erosion of democracy and to a weakening of Government,
often described as &quot;the passing of Parliament&quot;. The electoral system
has kept that now sterile, male dominated, two-party system in place for far too
long. A greater variety of interests, persons and cultures should be represented
in the National Parliament. The role of the citizens in constitutional change
has been minimal and tokenistic. The initiative and timing of referendums is the
prerogative of the Government of the day. Almost every constitutional referendum
turns into a political slanging match regardless of the merits of the proposal(s).
Only eight of many such referendums have been successful over the 100 years of
federation. The rejection of the four proposals of the 1988 referendum
demonstrated the present Constitution's dangerous inflexibility once again.
Updating the Constitution has proven to be far too difficult. The result has
been to devise expensive ways to circumvent it, often unsuccessfully, a recipe
for stagnation and deterioration.</p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF"><b><font size="+1">c/</font></b> </font>The PLP's
answer to these problems is that the piecemeal tinkering must end. Australians
need to rewrite the entire constitution. The idea that the constitution cannot
be replaced by another one, supposedly because it can only be amended (and then
only in terms of the highly unsatisfactory amending clause, section 128), is no
more than a legal fiction. It suggests that the legal system ultimately rules
Australia rather than the people. This line of argument, frequently voiced by
so-called constitutional experts, suggests that today's Australians are shackled
by past agreements among some of the citizens who voted on the 1900 Constitution
Draft in a VOLUNTARY referendum 100 YEARS AGO.</p>
<h3><font face="arial narrow" color="#c00000" size="+2">SECTION 2: A Maximalist
Model for Political and Constitutional Reform in Australia</font></h3>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">2a/</font></b> The phoney Minimalist
Republic 'debate' resulted in the Constitutional Convention of February, 1998.
The Convention was dominated by conservative politicians, Minimalist candidates
of the ARM and the pro-monarchist candidates. However, a vocal minority of
Maximalist candidates presented the kind of arguments which are embodied in PLP
policy as well. In addition, the Australian voters favour a directly elected
President a fact that the conservative majority at the Convention found hard to
deal with. We have incorporated that wish also in our policy.</p>
<p><font color="#00FFFF"><b><font size="+1">2b/</font></b> </font>That policy
now follows:</p>
<i>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">A. </font></i><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">Head
of State to be directly elected by the Australian people.</h4>
</font>
<p>Head of State to have essentially symbolic powers, plus some reserve powers
aimed essentially at breaking legislative deadlocks. In the event of legislative
deadlock the President convenes a joint sitting of Parliament where a majority
can resolve the matter, or otherwise a referendum is called.</p>
<p>The PLP does not favour the US-style Presidential system or a dual executive
structure (as for instance in France).</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">B. The Prime Minister
will remain the effective Head of Government.</font></h4>
<p>This official is the leader of the party or coalition of parties which
command majority support on the floor of the House of Representatives</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">C. * The PLP is most
concerned with the lack of quality in political executive government.</font></h4>
<p><i>We propose a democratisation and broadening of cabinet government in
Australia, including consideration of</i> :</p>
<ul>
  <p>&nbsp;
  <li>Inclusion of ministers with appropriate expertise and experience from
    outside of Parliament (as is the practice in most overseas countries);
  <li>Nomination of ministers not only by the Prime Minister but also by unions
    and community organisations in their sphere of responsibility;
  <li>Election of cabinet by the whole of parliament, instead of appointment by
    prime minister or factional leaders;
  <li>Direct election by voters of all executive/cabinet positions;
  <li>All ministers to be responsible to parliament, and subject to recall at
    any time.</li>
</ul>
<b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">Ministerial Codes of Conduct</font></b>
<p>We endorse the creation of codes of conduct for each Ministerial Department
in order to enshrine a character of ethics and accountability to the decision
making processes and to ensure that the Universal Human Rights of the UN Charter
and a concern for the welfare of all people becomes the fundamental basis for
all policy making.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">D. Measures to end to
the domination of the National Parliament by two parties.</font></h4>
<p>The PLP calls <i>for a referendum to introduce Proportional Representation</i>
by means of the Hare-Clark system based on multi-member electoral districts
(these districts could be same as the administrative regions for local
governments.)</p>
<p>This would provide scope for the representation of more parties and
Independents - provided they would have minum support of, say, 4% or 5% in a
nine-member district. This would also end the single-member (district) system,
pork barrelling, by-elections, neglected seats (safe seats), electoral boundary
changes and the adversarial mode of debate.</p>
<p>The proportion of votes required for representation in a district would not
be able to be raised without a referendum or some other means of democratic
consultation. This is to ensure that major parties in a district cannot simply
vote together and raise the percentage without community consultation, in order
to reduce the representation of smaller rival parties and independents.</p>
<p>A system of 30 electoral districts, each returning nine members, would yield
a 270 member legislature (House of Representatives). Add to this three Senators
per district (possibly not belonging to any party) and a total of 360 MPs would
represent the nation in Canberra. That would be less than half the present total
number if the states are abolished. The Hare Clark system is well known in
Australia as it is used in Tasmania, the ACT, and for the present Senate
elections. It is preferred over other PR systems, such as list PR systems and
the NZ MMD system of PR (based on the German system).</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">The Senate would retain its present powers
and functions.</font></p>
<p></b>The Senate , already elected by PR - Hare Clarke now (although distorted
by &quot;malapportionment&quot; on account of the federal system and state
representation) would retain its present powers and functions. However, in the
PLP proposal Senators would not represent the abolished states. The principal
functions of the Senate would be legislative review and holding Parliamentary
inquiries as at present. The PLP would remove the power of blocking Supply .</p>
<p>The PLP favours the Robson Rotation system for PR (used in the ACT, and
Tasmania) with the right to discontinue the allocation of preferences beyond the
number of vacant positions. the PLP supports Voter-determined Above-the-line or
Under-the-line Optional Preference Voting. Compulsory voting will be retained.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">E. The introduction of a
FIXED four-year terms for the National Parliament and Government -</font></h4>
<p>with provision for optional early elections only if a Government has lost
majority support in the House of Representatives, and after exhausting all
options of forming a new government under the existing parliament.</p>
<p>Fixed-term parliaments are supported by many people but the major parties
won't take steps to introduce this reform once in power. The advantages are
widely accepted though. It provides time to implement policy and predictability.
It reduces uncertainty and the frequency of elections.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">Change the electoral law or write it into
the new constitution.</font></b></p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">F. The creation of a
two-tier<i> </i>system of elected government with STRONG local government units.</font></h4>
<p>The present states could be replaced by smaller, administrative regions
indirectly elected by groups of local councils and/or on some BioRegional
principle. Special separate City Administrations could be established modelled
perhaps on the Greater Brisbane Council<i>.</p>
<p></i><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">This would reduce direct popular
elections to two levels: the national and local levels.</font></p>
<p></b>The regions could be grafted onto the local government tier. Already an
extensive system of voluntary regional councils exists which could be a base to
start from. The savings of such measures have been estimated to be in the order
of many billions of dollars (possibly $30 billion p.a., Drummond in Hall, 1998)
depending on what model of regional administration is adopted. E.g. Drummond has
developed detailed scenarios of such options by means of cost/benefit analyses
based on applications of linear regression techniques to State, Territory and
Local Government outlay as well as population data.</p>
<p>The need for special regions to ensure representation for sparsely populated
outlying areas is acknowledged and will be accommodated.</p>
<p><b><font size="+1" color="#00FFFF">Existing powers and responsibilities of
the states would be redistributed between national and regional governing
bodies.</font></p>
<p></b>The PLP greatly favours the strengthening of local government, both in
terms of funding and functions. In order to effectively extend functions
critical mass needs to be achieved and some smaller local government units would
need to be amalgamated. Certain functions which are now the domain of state
governments will be transferred to local government of sufficient size and
capacity to handle them. In addition, the PLP will introduce the precinct (or
ward) system to ensure maximum community involvement in local government - and
generally promote grassroots democracy in every way possible.</p>
<p>In 1900 an excellent case could be made for a federal structure. A lot has
changed since then. Communications and transport systems have improved
dramatically. In 2000 a country of only 19 million people does not need a
federal structure, seven different administrations plus that of the Northern
Territory and ACT. All the reasons for federation have long disappeared!</p>
<p>As a first step the PLP advocates the abolition of the state upper houses by
means of state referendums - assuming that our priority No. 1, the introduction
of PR for state lower houses, has first been achieved. This would then be
followed by a campaign to abolish the states altogether.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">G. The introduction of a
Bill of Rights, including a preamble concerning the rights of Indigenous people
and providing a conciliatory settlement with similar status and protection as a
Bill of Rights.</font></h4>
<p>The protection of human rights and special minorities will also be included
in a Bill of Rights.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">H. The introduction of
national environmental aims and safeguards</font></h4>
<p>together with ways of redress and compensation where a community¹s or
industry's livelihood is adversely affected.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">I. The amendment
procedure for the new Constitution will be simple.</font></h4>
<p>The new Constitution can be amended in two ways:</p>
<p>ONE: by a 3/4 majority of all National Parliamentarians of both Houses of
Parliament voting jointly</p>
<p>OR by a binding, mandatory national referendum which can be introduced in two
ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Initiated by the Government of the day
  <li>Initiated by the people on the basis of a petition signed by 1% of the
    electors on the national electoral roll<font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1"></li>
  </ol>
  J. Review of Constitution procedure</font>
<p>The new Constitution needs to be extensively reviewed after every five years.
The review need to be given wide publicity and adjustment facilitated.</p>
<h3><font face="arial narrow" color="#c00000" size="+2">SECTION 3: Drafting the
New Constitution, - Constitutional Continuity, - Launching the New Constitution
by means of Section 128</font></h3>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">K. Who would draft the
New Constitution?</font></h4>
<p>The PLP recommends a panel of 50 persons representing various key
constituencies of all age groups and all classes in society. These should be in
a position to consult extensively with their constituencies . Politicians should
number no more than five and constitutional experts would be equally limited to
five. There could be five foreign constitutional experts to provide input.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">L. Continuity</font></h4>
<p>It is desirable that the Constitution has a link with the old one and
provides continuity in spite of introducing radical changes. Many new
Constitutions of national states have been the outcome of great political and/or
social upheavals, major crises such as wars, a struggle for independence, civil
unrest and secession. However, this does not mean that states which are not
subject to such major crises (a) therefore have no need for major changes to the
ground rules of their governmental system; (b) that such changes as are needed
cannot be achieved in a civil, democratic and peaceful manner. After all major
crises are almost always the result of inadequate, evolutionary adjustment.</p>
<p>Moreover, the notion that Australia is free from crisis at present would be
challenged by many and denied only by the ultra conservative and foolhardy. It
has become a very unequal country in recent decades with many pressing social
issues. In economic terms Australia is struggling to maintain its independence
and achieve greater competitiveness. International capital is increasingly
dictating her destiny. Australia's present Constitution and political system has
severe constraints which, the PLP maintains, cannot be remedied by ineffectual
piecemeal tinkering at the margins.</p>
<h4><font face="arial narrow" color="#a00040" size="+1">M. Launching the New
Constitution through Section 128 - an evolutionary method</font></h4>
<p>The principal problem in having a constitutional referendum accepted has been
the requirement laid down in Section 128 that , apart from a national majority,
there has to be &quot;majority in a majority of states&quot;. Clearly this
represents a bias in favour of the federal system itself. In order to alleviate
this problem, an undemocratic feature of the present Constitution the cause of
much rigidity and expense, the following strategy is recommended:</p>
<p>In a &quot;New Constitution Referendum&quot; there could be two questions in
order to overcome the &quot;majority of states&quot; problem, as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>For the purpose of voting on this New Constitution Package are you in
    favour of disregarding a requirement of Section 128 that a constitutional
    referendum needs to be carried by a majority of states? YES/NO
  <li>Do you support the proposition that the New Constitutional Package should
    replace the present Constitution in its entirety? YES/NO</li>
</ol>
