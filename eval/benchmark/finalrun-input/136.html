<a name="111913164034044354">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>STARBUCKS IS EVIL! (A FISKING): <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/17/AR2005061701226.html">This front pager</a> from the WaPo is the most enterainingly absured bit of muckraking I have read in a very long time. It reports that Starbucks' overpriced lattes are impoverishing needy students across the nation. I sent my brief response to the Post in the form of a letter to the editor:<br /><blockquote>Dear Washington Post,<br /><br />God bless Starbucks. If overpriced coffee ["<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/17/AR2005061701226.html">Javanomics 101</a>", National, June 18] helps more students like myself get through college and grad school, then more power to it. <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/earnings/call1usboth.html">Data from the 2000 Census</a> shows that Americans with a bachelor's degree earned about $15,000 more per year than those with a high school degree. Those with an advanced degree earned an additional $13,000 per year, approximately. This divide has grown steadily over the years and will continue to grow as information and services become more and more important to our national economy. The next time you see a stressed-out student ordering a Double Caramel Part-Skim Macchiato, what you should feel is hope, not pity.<br /><br />David Adesnik<br />Charlottesville, VA</blockquote>My longer response shall take the form of a full frontal fisking, in which I haven't engaged for quite some time: <blockquote><p>Javanomics 101: Today's Coffee is Tomorrow's Debt;<br />The Latte Generation Hears a Wake Up Call<br /><br />By Blaine Harden<br />Washington Post Staff Writer<br />Saturday, June 18, 2005; Page A01<br /><br />SEATTLE -- At a Starbucks across the street from Seattle University School of Law, Kirsten Daniels crams for the bar exam. She's armed with color-coded pens, a don't-mess-with-me crease in her brow and what she calls "my comfort latte."<br /><br />She just graduated <em>summa cum laude</em>, after three years of legal training that left her $115,000 in debt. Part of that debt, which she will take a decade to repay with interest, was run up at Starbucks, where she buys her lattes.<br /><a href="javascript:void(popitup(" imgid="PH2005061800111&imgUrl=/photo/2005/06/18/PH2005061800111.html',650,850))&quot;"></a><a href="javascript:void(popitup(" imgid="PH2005061800111&imgUrl=/photo/2005/06/18/PH2005061800111.html',650,850))&quot;"></a><br />Part of the $115,000 debt Kirsten Daniels of Seattle incurred to finance law school went toward her regular caffeine fix. The habit costs her nearly $3 a day, and it's one that her law school says she and legions like her cannot afford.<br /><br /><em>My heart is already bleeding for poor Ms. Daniels. To think that she might be only $112,000 in debt if not for the pernicious influence of Starbucks! </em><br /><em></em><br /><em>And might I ask how much will Ms. Daniels be earning next year? Seattle University may only be #95 in the </em><a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/law/brief/lawrank_brief.php"><em>US News &amp; World Report rankings</em></a><em>, but my cousin went to law school at #96, Syracuse, and he is pulling down top dollar at a New York firm these days.</em><br /><br />It borders on apostasy in this caffeine-driven town (home to more coffee shops per capita than any major U.S. city, as well as Starbucks corporate headquarters), but the law school is aggressively challenging the drinking habits of students such as Daniels.<br /><br />"A latte a day on borrowed money? It's crazy," said Erika Lim, director of career services at the law school.<br /><br /><em>I'm glad Ms. Lim is worried about the really important things that affect her students' prospects for a successful future.</em><br /><br />To quantify the craziness, Lim distributes coffee-consumption charts. One shows that a five-day-a-week $3 latte habit on borrowed money can cost $4,154, when repaid over 10 years. She also directs students to a Web site she helped create. The "Stop Buying Expensive Coffee and Save Calculator" ( <a href="http://www.hughchou.org/calc/coffee.cgi" target="">http://www.hughchou.org/calc/coffee.cgi</a> ) shows that if you made your own coffee and for 30 years refrained from buying a $3 latte, you could save $55,341 (with interest).<br /><br /><em>Remember how in high school they used to brink in a throat cancer survivor with an electronic voice box to tell you about the perils of smoking? Perhaps Ms. Lim can invite some impoverished middle-aged lawyers to tell the students at Seattle U. about how Starbucks forces their children to go to bed hungry at night.</em><br /><br />Inside the Starbucks across from the law school, Daniels seemed surprised -- but unmoved -- to hear all this. "I guess I never had done the math," she said. "On the other hand, I would be a very crabby person without my comfort latte."<br />Therein lies the rub for those who would curb latte consumption with pocketbook reasoning. As Lim concedes, "no one pays any attention."<br /><br /><em>How did an ignoramus like Kirsten Daniels ever graduate</em> summa cum laude<em>? Doesn't she know that counting her coffee dollars is at least as important as acing her coursework? And even if Daniels is no Einstein, I bet she can estimate how much more she will earn as a reuslt of having a law degree.</em><br /><br />Financial planners, best-selling investment gurus and a number of advice columnists have been warning consumers for years that seemingly insignificant daily spending on such luxuries as gourmet coffee can, over time, sabotage savings and hobble a person's financial future.<br /><br /><em>It's not the cigarettes. It's not the booze. It's not even McDonalds. It is the gourmet coffee that is forces senior citizens to eat cat food!</em><br /><br />But these warnings, too, have been ignored, at least as measured by the runaway growth and profitability of Starbucks, the world's leading purveyor of specialty coffee. Its stock is up more than 1,200 percent in the past 10 years. When it went public in 1992, the company had 125 stores. It now has more than 9,000 locations around the world and long-term plans for 20,000 more.<br /><br /><em>Call the United Nations! Call Bono! If Starbucks opens another 20,000 locations worldwide, the poverty epidemic may never be stopped. By the way, has anyone suggested to the French and Germans that the real cause of their double-digit unemployment is Starbucks?</em><br /><br />Starbucks declined to comment for this article, referring questions to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, a trade group. Its spokesman, Mike Ferguson, said that coffee shops provide an excellent opportunity for students to do their homework...<br /><br /><em>Godd***ed corporate stooges! It's people like Mike Ferguson who put a smiling face on the rape of American youth. And what about Starbucks? It's no better than a child molester walking the courthouse steps muttering to the press, "No comment. No comment."</em><br /><br />In decades past, lenders chided college students for excessive spending of borrowed money on pizza and cigarettes, but the staggering ubiquity of Starbucks appears to have narrowed the nagging to foamy espresso drinks...<br /><br /><em>Don't forget the famous Pizza Crisis of the 1970s! It didn't get as much attention as the oil crisis, but that's just because the Italians control the media. Which reminds me, who do you think invented espresso and cappucino?</em><br /><br />"The question that needs to be posed is 'Do they really need to have a Starbucks every day?' " said Jeffrey Hanson, director of borrower education service at Access Group, a Delaware-based organization that is the nation's third-largest provider of graduate school loans. "Since they are living, in part, on borrowed money, they need to be aware of the opportunity cost of that $3 latte. Once they spend it, it is not available for a loaf of bread."...<br /><br /><em>Hanson is right. Who do you think is really responsible for the legions of ragged students begging for crusts of bread in Cambridge and Berkeley? Starbucks, that's who.</em><br /><br />But these warnings have a way of getting lost amid the sweet aromas emanating from university-owned espresso shops inside nearly every major building on campus. The university began a major espresso expansion in 1997, after a survey found that coffee was far and away the favorite on-campus "food."...<br /><br /><em>It's a sad tale, but true. The thrifty young student comes to campus in pursuit of knowledge, only be to led astray by casual sex, recreational drugs and the sweet aromas of the roasted coffee bean.</em><br /><br />At Seattle University School of Law, Lim concedes the futility of persuading students to stop spending borrowed money on high-priced coffee. Still, she refuses to give up. The consequences of latte-larded law school debts are worrisome for the legal profession, she said, insidiously tilting career paths toward jobs that pay more but satisfy less.<br /><br /><em>Thank God for the lonely crusaders like Erika Lim. Sure, everyone thought that the abolitionists were crazy in the 1830s and 1840s. But just as their persistence ended our enslavement to King Cotton, crusaders like Lim will liberate us from King Coffee.</em><br /><br />"The amount of money you owe directly affects the professional choices you have," she said.<br /><br />Debt-panicked law school graduates, she said, tend to run away from low-paying jobs such as public defender (about $45,000 a year) and into the more remunerative arms of corporate law.<br /><br />Lim, by the way, is not a latte drinker, unless someone else pays.<br /><br /><em>Just like me. I don't frequent prostitutes unless someone else pays them. As for the lack of public defenders, I assure you with total confidence that it has absolutely nothing to do with the rising cost of tuition at America's law schools.</em><br /><br /><em>In closing, all I can say is: Students of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chain-stores!</em></p></blockquote><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111912572686733455">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>ONLY BUSH CAN DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO UZBEKISTAN: The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050614.html">White House</a> says that DoD is on board with its efforts to stand up for human rights and democracy in Uzbekistan, but the press has been <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/13/AR2005061301550.html">reporting a split</a> between State and Defense for some time now.<br /><br />While refusing to actually say that it opposes the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/14/AR2005061401052.html">State Department's efforts</a> to hold Uzbek strongman Islam Karimov accountable for the recent massacre in Andijon, the military would apparently prefer to preserve <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/14/AR2005061401695.html">access to its bases</a> in Uzbekistan.<br /><br />If Bush wants Karimov to know that America is serious about human rights and democracy promotion, he will have to deliver the message himself. Otherwise, Karimov will have a strong incentive to interpret the lack of consensus in Washington as a greenlight for further repression.  Moreover, Bush will have to back his message up by making firm demands for an external investigation of the events at Andijon.<br /><br />Almost two weeks ago, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060701579.html">WaPo</a> argued that the value of our bases in Uzbekistan is hardly enough to justify compromising our most important principles in the war on terror. There are bases available elsewhere. In contrast, our credibility will suffer a damaging blow if we allow Karimov to crush legitimate dissent in the name of fighting Islamic terrorists. As the <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/635iihrr.asp">Weekly Standard</a> points out,<br /><blockquote>The Taliban has been defeated, and, with the liberation of Iraq, the nature of the global struggle to which the Bush administration is committed is no longer exclusively focused on the destruction of terrorist redoubts. We are now committed to a democratizing effort that challenges tyranny along with terror as threats to peace and freedom around the world. The Uzbek regime that was part of the solution in 2001 is now, with its bloody suppression of protests, part of the problem.</blockquote>Republicans on the Hill have also become increasingly critical of Karimov. The WaPo editorial points out that after returning from a visit to Tashkent, John McCain, Lindsey Graham and John Sununu all announced that Karimov's behavior has called the value of our diplomatic relationship into question.<br /><br />Some might suggest that Bush's minimal presence up to this point suggests that he isn't following the issue or isn't concerned about human rights and democracy in Uzbekistan.  But for quite some time now, Bush has refused to make excuses for authoritarian allies.   He hasn't challenged every one the way he has Putin or Mubarak, but that takes time.  Given a little more time, I expect Bush to approach Uzbekistan in a manner fully consistent with his principles.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111911997117969777">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>A SCHOLARLY DEFENSE OF REALISM: Grad student PS takes OxBlog to task for attacking a <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_oxblog_archive.html#111907127025797816">strawman version of realism</a> rather than the doctrine itself: <blockquote>First off, the notion that a nuclear Iraq would be problematic but not inherently disastrous isn’t some bizarre notion – the fairly-insane regimes of Stalin and Mao proved manageable even once they got nuclear weapons. The same arguments made in favor of stopping a nuclear Iraq were also made in the early 1960s about stopping the PRC from getting the bomb (see Frank Gavin’s recent work on the Gilpatric Commission) and have been proven quite terribly wrong in retrospect. So maybe “wow” is one possible response, but another might be “nuclear deterrence is pretty robust, even in the face of genocidal psychopaths.”<br /><br />Second, you badly misrepresent Mearsheimer’s arguments, and the rest of realism’s approach to the Cold War. He wasn’t a Cold War dove in the 1980s, but neither was he a hawk as you claim – he cut his teeth arguing that the conventional balance in Europe wasn’t nearly as bad for NATO as hawks like Sam Huntington and Eliot Cohen kept claiming it was (see the 1988 exchange in IS between Mearsheimer, Posen, and Cohen for an example; moreover, history has borne JJM out on this argument). His “Back to the Future” article’s analysis was premised on US withdrawal from Europe, which didn’t happen, and so the causal logic hasn’t had a chance to be tested (by the way, it was 1990, not the mid-1990s).<br /><br />Third, it’s not clear that somehow Morgenthau was wrong in arguing that such fun adventures as Vietnam were not in America’s vital national interests. The twilight wars on the periphery were sideshows from defending the main strongpoints that locked up the keys to world power. It’s not threat deflation to say that American vital interests were simply not involved in places like Africa. Moreover, it’s hard to tell exactly what you’re referring to with the Cold War and realism – apparently “many other realists were hawkish then too” but somehow also were “downgrading the threat.” For the most part in the 1980s realists were arguing for robust conventional and nuclear deterrence in Europe and East Asia while trying to keep the US from getting too bogged down in the Third World. Europe mattered, while the Third World only did in certain areas and in certain ways. A mixture of hawkishness and dove-ishness.<br /><br />Fourth, I don’t understand your critique of defensive realism as ignoring the domestic nature of regimes (an “almost complete disregard”). Walt writes on the effects of revolution, Van Evera on militarism, organizational politics, nationalism, and misperception (you might want to read “Primed for Peace” or “Hypotheses on Nationalism and War” or “Why Cooperation Failed in WWI”), Posen on military organizations (“Sources of Military Doctrine”), and Snyder on domestic log-rolling, bureaucracies and international expansion (“Myths of Empire” and “The Ideology of the Offensive”). Most of this was written during the Cold War or was developed during it and published very soon after. Since then, people like Tom Christensen and Randy Schweller have very seriously looked at domestic politics. So I’m not really sure exactly what your point is. Snyder and Van Evera explicitly talked about democracies as being less expansionistic than dictatorships and especially oligarchic/log-rolling regimes. Maybe that’s “almost complete disregard” but given that these are major figures it’s hard to see how. Some people disagree with them, while others don’t think they go far enough in looking at domestic politics. But it’s not like domestic politics have been ignored.<br /><br />Fifth, Walt appears to be right that NATO is no longer a very important alliance – the US doesn’t use it for much of anything, and the Europeans are slowly putting together their own power projection force. And if it does exist in some serious fashion, I don’t see how that’s the result of democracy. The US has been allied with Saudi Arabia and Jordan for decades too, and that’s not because of democracy.<br /><br />Sixth, the offensive/defensive realist distinction you make is wrong – both look at armed force as the only effective deterrent. “The implicit deterrent of alliances” you refer to as the focus of defensive realists is backed by armed force; alliances are about armed force. The distinction between offensive and defensive realism is based on other things, like the efficiency of balancing, the probabilistic or possibilistic nature of state decision-making, the impact of nuclear weapons on deterrence, the ability to signal and detect state “type,” and the impact of domestic pathologies (discussed above) in leading to war. Armed force is crucial to both, as it is to any theory of international security, realist or not.<br /><br />So I guess I just remain confused by your intellectual history of the field and current read on world politics. And I’m not really comfortable with you casting sweeping aspersions on the beliefs and motives of scholars whose work you appear not to have read, at least in any detail. Realists of various stripes have been right about lots of things, have looked at the issues you claim they haven’t, and have offered much more nuanced arguments than you give them credit for. They’ve also been wrong about lots of issues and ignored others, obviously. It’s always fun to beat up on “realism” but there are good and bad ways to do it.</blockquote>Let me respond briefly. First of all, I think PS does a good job of illustrating that my previous comments can't do full justice to a scholarly enterprise in which hundreds of brilliant men and women have taken part over the past few decades. For those with a serious interest in realism, there is no replacement for reading actual books written by realists, rather than OxBlog's anti-realist polemics.<br /><br />That said, I stand by my basic points and continue to disagree with PS. Unless one is comfortable with the current situation in North Korea, I don't see how one can describe deterrence as a robust response to the hypothetical situation of a nuclear Iraq (c. 2002) or Iran today. My previous point about the Cuban Missile Crisis suggests why deterrence was not ideal or safe during the Cold War, either.<br /><br />Second, Morgenthau deserves credit for his early opposition to the war in Vietnam. However, this in no way vindicates his persistent criticism of Truman and others for taking Soviet ideology very seriously. With regard to the 1980s and the late Cold War, I basically agree with PS's characterization of where the realists stood.<br /><br />When it comes to the defensive realists and domestic politics, I will avoid further discussion on the somewhat spurious grounds that this debate is too detailed and too distant from actual history and politics. (If I am wrong, and there are a lot of you out there who want to see OxBlog wrangle over the legacy of defensive realism, just send me an e-mail.) The same point applies to the subject of the offensive-defensive divide, although in that instance I tend to agree with PS's characterization of the subject.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111907276397017004">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>DEFENDING KISSINGER (BUT NOT REALISM): OxBlog is fortunate to have a very sophisticated readership.  Thus, <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_oxblog_archive.html#111907127025797816">not just one</a>, but two scholars have taken the time to critique my recent post about <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_oxblog_archive.html#111873461595182281">China and Kissinger</a>.  AS writes in that<blockquote>I think you've missed some of the insight in Kissinger's (admittedly dull) commentary on China. The comparison between Clausewitz and Sunzi is more telling than chronology may indicate, for while the current batch of Chinese leaders may be closer in time to Mao, they are far closer in thinking to the legalist and Confucian bureaucrats of millennia past. It is an age-old tradition of foreign peoples trying to conquer the territory of China, only to be conquered themselves by its civilization. It happened first to the Mongols, then to the Manchus, and now to the German/Russian communists.</blockquote>Although I defer to others' expertise about China, it would seem to me that the old men now running the show in Beijing were thoroughly indoctrinated by the totalitarian Maoist system in the 50s and 60s.  Shall we suppose that once Deng's liberalization began in the 80s, these men became sudden converts to the wisdom of Sunzi (aka Sun Tzu)?<br /><br />On a related note, AS continues that:<blockquote>While China may be a vast empire, it is run very differently from the Soviet one before it. Russian culture was not developed enough to sustain true authoritarianism--even in the darkest days of Stalin's purges, underground organizers and samizdat publishers continued operating. The entire Soviet Union, not just the non-Russian parts but the Russian as well, were held together by force because they could not be held together by politics. Contrast the experience of the Cultural Revolution, where the sheer development of Chinese society (socially, not economically) created a web of passive oppression that left no free time or individuality for 'counter-revolutionaries.' </blockquote>Twenty years ago, who would have said that Russian culture, from the czars to the Politburo, wasn't developd enough to sustain true authortarianism?  That said, of course I agree that China is very different from the Soviet Union, but primarily because it now allows many of its citizens some very important measures of freedom, primarily economic.  Although I again defer to others' expertise about China, my knowledge of the Cultural Revolution suggests that there was very little passive about it.  Its brutality was overt and horrific.<br /><br />Returning to the present day, AS argues that:<blockquote>This is not to say that the Chinese system is any less oppressive or less evil. It is to say that military force, and the entire web of containment created to combat the Soviet threat, will be far less useful with regard to China...In China, such a scenario is entirely implausible: the country's economic growth, though unsustainable, is not going to collapse into depression. More importantly, the use of political and social power in the background to control society (ever since learning their lesson after Tienanmen) means that the vast majority of native Chinese harbor no real resentment against the system. To talk to them, the communist party is like a big corporation: silly with its rules, policies and propaganda, but ultimately more a joke than a monstrous evil. </blockquote>I have very serious reservations about the assertion that most Chinese regard the ruling party as little more than a bureaucratic inconvenience.  Although what we mostly hear about is economic progress, there is enough <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201531.html">violent social tension</a> in China to break onto America's front pages every so often.  Although prosperity mitigates such concerns, corrupation and abuse is rampant in the PRC.<br /><br />AS concludes that:<blockquote>Put simply, the Chinese state is too well held together by economic success and strong social control to simply succumb to containment. </blockquote>That I may agree with.  But China doesn't have an ideology of global expansion the way the Soviet Union did, so containing it would amount to something very different than another Cold War.  In short, we need to defend Taiwan, support the Japanese, and restrict Chinese support for rogue governments and (possibly) terrorist organizations. <br /><br />What we are waiting for in the meantime is not for the Chinese system to collapse under its own weight, but for the people of China (and perhaps even the government) to see that becoming a First World nation demands political reforms as well as economic ones.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111907127025797816">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>DEFENDING REALISM (BUT NOT KISSINGER): Dr. DN, a real live professor of international relations, protests that <blockquote>You can't be serious when <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2005_06_12_oxblog_archive.html#111873461595182281">you write</a> [about China]: <blockquote>"Then what? Be prepared, I suppose. Strengthen our alliance with Japan and other allies in the Pacific. And, if at all possible, avoid indulging ourselves in the willful naivete of the realists."</blockquote>Ever read any Mearsheimer? The realists think China is where *all* the action is at vis-a-vis coming political conflicts, and they don't think much of the liberal "socialization" project for China. Kissinger is an outlier because, to be blunt, he represents a lot of interests that would like us to make nice to China....Don't pin this on realism.</blockquote>I have had the misfortune to read many things written by Prof. Mearsheimer, but not regarding China. What those readings indicate is that Mearsheimer, like Kissinger, sometimes draws on a remarkable well of naivete in order to justify accommodating dangerous opponents. Although many intelligent individuals opposed the invasion of Iraq on fairly substantive grounds, Mearsheimer and fellow realist Stephen Walt argued that going to war was a <a href="http://volokh.com/2002_12_08_volokh_archive.html#90045761">bad idea</a> even if we were fully confident that Saddam was in the process of developing nuclear weapons. They wrote: <blockquote>But what if Saddam invaded Kuwait again and then said he would use nuclear weapons if the United States attempted another Desert Storm? Again, this threat is not credible. If Saddam initiated nuclear war against the United States over Kuwait, he would bring U.S. nuclear warheads down on his own head. Given the choice between withdrawing or dying, he would almost certainly choose the former. Thus, the United States could wage Desert Storm II against a nuclear-armed Saddam without precipitating nuclear war. </blockquote>Wow. Wow. Repeat: Wow. These guys were confident that a nuclear Iraq would've been no problem to handle. As I <a href="http://volokh.com/2002_12_08_volokh_archive.html#90045761">responded</a> at the time: <blockquote>One could have argued at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis that according to strict logic, nuclear war was impossible. Yet no one knew that then and no one knows it now. </blockquote>What's interesting is that realism has a long pedigree of favoring appeasement. E.H. Carr, the founding father of realism, was a staunch supporter of Neville Chamberlain's accomodationist approach to Hitler.  And I think I'm not exaggerating when I say that Hitler was the Hitler of his time.<br /><br />In the early 1950s, the second founding father of realism, <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2004_12_12_oxblog_archive.html#110335011000886449">Hans Morgenthau</a>, viciously denounced Truman for being too hawkish toward the Soviets.  Now it is true that the other great realist of the late 40s and early 50s -- <a href="http://oxblog.blogspot.com/2005_03_13_oxblog_archive.html#111113507734628288">George Kennan</a> -- elaborated the doctrine of containment.  Yet by the early 50s, Kennan had also turned against Truman on the grounds that he was too hawkish.  In fact, Kennan even opposed the creation of NATO.<br /><br />So what we see from Carr, to Morgenthau, to Kennan, to Kissinger, to Mearsheimer & Walt (c. 2002) is a resilient tradition of downgrading the threat presented by aggressive dictatorships.  Yet as Prof. DN would be sure to point out, Mearsheimer was the quite the hawk during the 1980s.  Many other realists were hawkish then as well.<br /><br />This countertrend represented the growth of an emerging divide between "offensive" and "defensive" realists.  The offensive faction tended to see the costs of aggression as low, and therefore thought of armed force as the only effective deterrent.  The defensive faction had more confidence in the implicit deterrent of alliances, for example the Sino-American willingness to punish hypothetical Soviet aggression.<br /><br />What united the offensive and defensive factions was an almost total disregard for the internal composition of the regimes they analyzed.  The idea that democracies don't go to war with one another struck <em>them</em> as being as naive and dangerous.<br /><br />These days, realism is in a state of flux, primarily because of the end of the Cold War.  According to almost all pre-1991 realist theory, a unipolar world is something that simply shouldn't exist.  Then, in the mid-1990s, Mearsheimer famously invested his reputation in the prediction that in the absence of a Soviet threat, Europe would descend once again into the internecine warfare of the pre-1945 era.  Around the same time, Walt predicted that in the absence of a Soviet threat, NATO would fall apart.  As you can see, the probelm with these bold predictions is that they ignored the difference between dictatorship and democracy.<br /><br />Getting back to China, I'm guessing that the same offensive-defensive divide that bifurcated realist approaches to the Soviet Union is also responsible for mixed opinions about China.  In addition, many realists have rushed to embrace the idea that democra<em>tizing</em> powers, as opposed to established democracies, are especially war prone.  When I track down Mearsheimer's latest on the Middle Kingdom, I'll let you know what he says.<br /><br />In conclusion, DN is right that I should tar every realist with the stain of Kissinger's Sinophilic accomodationism.  But the intellectual impulses responsible for Kissinger's short-sightness are endemic to the realist community.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

       <div style="clear:both;"></div>PHOTOBLOGGING  ROYAL ASCOT:  I went with OxBlog's Asia correspondent to York to cover Ascot yesterday, and a bit of photoblogging results.  I believe there were several races, though any real proof of this was obscured by the rotation of planetarily-dimensioned hats.  I personally did not have a flutter, but can nonetheless attest that all the nicest horses won anyway.  This I was told by someone wearing a hat.  <br /><br /><center><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascot1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascot2.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascot3.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascot4.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascot5.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.patrickbelton.com/photographs/ascotn&p.jpg"></center><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111873461595182281">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>KISSINGER -- THE DELUSIONS OF A REALIST: Once again, old Henry has persuaded the WaPo to publish one of his rambling essays about why America should befriend <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/12/AR2005061201533.html">those nice folks running the government in Beijing</a>. If you're looking for new ideas instead of shopworn cliches, don't bother with Kissinger's prose. But if you want to see all of the flaws of realism as an ideology presented in the space of single op-ed, this essay can't be beat.<br /><br />I think the place to start is with this delightful paragraph:<br /><blockquote>Military imperialism is not the Chinese style. Clausewitz, the leading Western strategic theoretician, addresses the preparation and conduct of a central battle. Sun Tzu, his Chinese counterpart, focuses on the psychological weakening of the adversary. China seeks its objectives by careful study, patience and the accumulation of nuances -- only rarely does China risk a winner-take-all showdown.</blockquote>I wonder how many folks in Tibet would agree that "military imperialism is not the Chinese style". Then again, it isn't exactly fair to judge the current government in Beijing by what its predecessor did more than fifty years ago.<br /><br />But if Kissinger is trying to argue that China has changed, what's with all of this hokum about Sun Tzu, who lived more than two thousand years ago? In contrast, Mao Zedong said much more recently that "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Yet the realistic Kissinger covenienty ignores the influence of Mao on the Party and the republic that he created.<br /><br />Now here's some more realistic analysis from Kissinger:<br /><blockquote>It is unwise to substitute China for the Soviet Union in our thinking and to apply to it the policy of military containment of the Cold War...The Russian empire was governed by force; the Chinese empire by cultural conformity with substantial force in the background.</blockquote>Someone (maybe someone from Tibet) should've told that guy standing in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square that China is governed by "substantial force" only "in the background". Apparently, Mr. Kissinger seems to have forgotten that China is still a dictatorship. In fact the word 'dictatorship' doesn't appear in his op-ed. Nor does 'democracy'. Nor does 'human rights'.<br /><br />As a committed realist, Kissinger desperately wants to believe that American foreign policy can be made without reference to the deeply-rooted ideals of democracy and human rights. And he's right; it can. From 1969 until 1976, the United States displayed almost no concern for democracy or human rights. Coincidentally, Kissinger served as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State from 1969 until 1976. (And the first president Kissinger worked for didn't even seem to be too concerned about subverting democracy within the United States.)<br /><br />In addition to being an ethical concern, democracy and human rights have a lot to do with national security. As <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/13/AR2005051301405.html">Robert Kagan</a> pointed out in his recent column about China, there is only one clear-cut case of a rising power in the international system making it to the top without fighting a war against the hegemon it displaced. That rising power was the United States. That hegemon was Britain. Rightly, Kagan observes that<br /><blockquote>The fact that both powers shared a common liberal, democratic ideology, and thus roughly consonant ideas of international order, greatly lessened the risk of accommodation from the British point of view.</blockquote>So, then, do China and the United States have "consonant ideas of international order"? Kissinger does quite a good job of evading this question. He never seems to tells us what it is that China wants or why some very smart people consider China to be quite threatening. Kissinger does insist, however, that<br /><blockquote>China, in its own interest, is seeking cooperation with the United States for many reasons, including the need to close the gap between its own developed and developing regions; the imperative of adjusting its political institutions to the accelerating economic and technological revolutions; and the potentially catastrophic impact of a Cold War with the United States on the continued raising of the standard of living, on which the legitimacy of the government depends.</blockquote>He almost makes it sound as if Jimmy Carter were the president of China. I have to admit, it would be nice if Beijing's concern for social inequality led it to pursue a more peaceful foreign policy. Yet in practice, Beijing seems to be doing exactly the opposite. In order to divert attention from probelms at home, it creates problems abroad. Of course, Kissinger conveniently avoids mentioning how the Chinese government recently whipped up an anti-Japanese furor for no good reason at all.<br /><br />Now let's get to the point. Assuming that Kissinger's analysis were correct, what kind of policy toward China should America have. Here's Kissinger's advice:<br /><blockquote>America needs to understand that a hectoring tone evokes in China memories of imperialist condescension and that it is not appropriate in dealing with a country that has managed 4,000 years of uninterrupted self-government. </blockquote>I thought that realists were supposed to be tough. I thought that realists placed an emphasis on power. Instead, Kissinger wants us to believe that foreign policy is about multicultural self-esteem.<br /><br />So then, if I disagree with Kissinger (and even dare to mock the Great Henry), what do I think we should do about China? Well, first of all, like Robert Kagan, I think China is the one that's going to decide what kind of relationship we have with it. We should speak out on behalf of democracy and human rights but never pretend that our expressions of interest can change the course of Chinese politics.<br /><br />Then what? Be prepared, I suppose. Strengthen our alliance with Japan and other allies in the Pacific. And, if at all possible, avoid indulging ourselves in the willful naivete of the realists.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

       <div style="clear:both;"></div>AT LEAST THEY WEREN'T LYING ABOUT THE WMD: Here's an interesting passage from the <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1648758_1,00.html">Second Downing Street Memo</a> that hasn't gotten much attention: <blockquote>8. The Chiefs of Staff have discussed the viability of US military plans. Their initial view is that there are a number of questions which would have to be answered before they could assess whether the plans are sound. Notably these include the realism of the 'Running Start', the extent to which the plans are proof against Iraqi counter-attack using chemical or biological weapons and the robustness of US assumptions about the bases and about Iraqi (un)willingness to fight.</blockquote>So it seems that the British Cabinet was profoundly concerned about Iraqi chemical and biological weapons. Relying on my Sherlock Holmes-ian powers of inference, I therefore infer that the Cabinet was wholly convinced that Saddam actually had chemical and biological weapons. If only they had lied and told us he didn't...<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111863647685526259">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>BRITISH MEMO FROM '02 PREDICTED MASS ENTHUSIASM FOR DEMOCRACY IN IRAQ: Yes, I completely made that up. What the WaPo actually reported on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/11/AR2005061100723.html">Sunday's front page</a> was that<br /><blockquote>Blair and his top advisers eight months before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq concluded that the U.S. military was not preparing adequately for what the British memo predicted would be a "protracted and costly" postwar occupation of that country.</blockquote>As <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006486.php">Kevin Drum</a> points out, this isn't exactly a revelation (even if <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2005/06/bush-and-blair-committed-to-war-in.html">Juan Cole</a> calls it a "bombshell"). No one needed secret intelligence, even in 2002, to discover that the Bush administration hadn't done enough to prepare for the occupation of Iraq. Even so, slightly more evidence in favor of this obvious point still gets front page coverage in the Post.<br /><br />(NB: The full text of the new British memo is <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1648758,00.html">here</a>. Link via <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/011070.html">Jeralyn Merritt</a>.)<br /><br />But what about the other side of the story? What about the fact that no one other than Bush seemed to believe that the people of Iraq would display tremendous enthusiasm for democracy once liberated from Saddam Hussein? If a British memo from 2002 had predicted what would happen in the elections of January 2005, that would really be news.<br /><br />Now, I recognize that journalists must serve as watchdogs, always ready to expose the failures of our government. Thus, the Bush administration deserves to be hammered for its pre-war planning.<br /><br />But if journalists want to educate the (reading) public, perhaps they should explore why all of the experts failed to anticipate the Iraqi people's enthusiasm for democracy. By the same token, they should explore why the Shi'ites have been so amazingly tolerant of Sunni terrorism.<br /><br />The reason to provide additional coverage of these subjects isn't that the Bush administration deserves better press. It is that the media is supposed to do more than present worst-case scenarios. In the long-run, looking at both sides of the equation will benefit the media, as well, by restoring the credibility it has squandered so magnificently of late.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

<a name="111863413579843646">&nbsp;</a><br />
      
       <div style="clear:both;"></div>HOW MANY TERRORISTS HAVE WE CAUGHT HERE AT HOME? Last Thursday, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050609-2.html">George W. Bush</a> said that <blockquote>Since September the 11th, federal terrorism investigations have resulted in charges against more than 400 suspects, and more than half of those charged have been convicted.</blockquote>That quote from the president serves as the launching point for a major WaPo article/investigation into whether the Justice Department has actually caught as many terrorists as Bush says. The investigation concludes that Justice has only won <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/daily/graphics/naterrorism_061205.html">39 convictions</a> on charges related to terrorism, rather than 200. Moreover, the majority of those convictions have nothing to do with either Al Qaeda or any other groups planning attacks on the United States.<br /><br />For some, even the number 39 represents vindication.  As <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/002714.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> points out, Paul Krugman is fond of saying that the Justice Department hasn't put a single terrorist in jail.  Malkin offers no defense of Bush's statistics, however. <br /><br />What I would add is that there are two important points that the article doesn't explore, presumably because of space limitations.  The first is why so few terrorists have been apprehended and imprisoned.  The WaPo mentions in passing that its results <blockquote>Raise the possibility that the presence of al Qaeda operatives and sympathizers within the United States is either limited or largely undetected, many terrorism experts say. </blockquote>That's a pretty big distinction.  If the answer is 'limited', one might say Bush deserves considerable credit for rolling up whatever Al Qaeda cells were in place.  If the answer is 'undetected', then we may all be in very big trouble and have to ask whether the Patriot Act is doing its job.<br /><br />Which leads me to my second point.  The purpose of Bush's speech on Thursday was to defend the Patriot Act and illustrate how it contributes to the search for terrorists in the United States.  The WaPo investigation doesn't say much at all about whether the 39 convictions it identified were made possible by the Patriot Act.  While it would be more impressive if the Act were responsible for 200 convictions, 39 may well be enough to justify the continuation of those Patriot Act provisions that are set to expire in the coming months.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>

       <div style="clear:both;"></div>OUR ASIA CORRESPONDENT writes a letter from Bangladesh where she has returned after four years:<blockquote> Very little has changed in the four years since I've been gone. Bangladesh is still one of the poorest countries in the world, ranking 138th on the Human Development Index in 2004 (which still does not put it at the bottom in South Asia - Pakistan ranks 142). The poverty is still breathtaking. The first time I was here, I noticed an alarming number of children and elderly people without limbs begging on the street. After enquiry, I learned that families often lop a limb off one person to increase their begging prospects. One child's arm means food for the other six or seven children. The middle class is miniscule to the point of non-existence. Any Bangladeshi with money or connections almost invariably goes overseas, most to the Gulf, the UK or the US, sending remittances home and providing one of the main sources of income for the country.<br /><br />IT is the new buzz here, but it is unclear whether it actually exists besides one sad-looking internet cafe with two computers in the 'wealthy' part of town (read: less than abject poverty). Both times I went there was no current and hence no internet, but in theory you could check your email. Dhaka still does not have a McDonald's nor any other international chain, although it does have a Dominous pizza (note the ingenious way around copyright) and a restaurant that has stolen the Chili's logo and sells Thai food. The country has trouble attracting foreign investment because it has one of the highest corruption rates in the world, exacerbated by a political system run almost entirely by two political families who trade off power almost every election. During my visit, two strikes called by the opposition caused economic activity to grind to a halt. Fearing reprisals from the organized crime mobs controlled by each of the families, the entire country shuts down. When I ventured onto the streets around 2 p.m., the only activity I saw on the usually congested streets was an occasional rickshaw. <br /><br />After several days in Dhaka, I traveled by launch down the Ganges River to the island of Bhola, which served as my home for several months back in 2001. Things here have changed more dramatically, but I fear for the worst. When I was here before, women did not adhere strictly to purdah and many ventured into the marketplace wearing only hijab. Now, women are largely kept to their homes and are required to wear a burkah in public. However, some advances have been made in women's health. Birth control in the form of contraceptive pills from India is now available, although apparently the local Madrassa has organized a campaign against its use (not that it seemed to be having much effect; most of the women see it as a Godsend). The island still only has a handful of doctors for 8 million people; education is spotty, although improving. I was glad to hear that in the past five years, families have begun to send their daughters to school past primary school. I also saw evidence that microfinance projects were living up to their touted potential here. Several women's craft guilds have appeared in the area since I visited last and many women appear to be supporting their families on the income they make. <br /><br />The biggest difference has to be the proliferation of cell phones and televisions. Before, the only telephone was owned by the police chief, who doled out phone privileges based on bribes or personal connections. Now, every third person seems to have a cell phone. The people in the area may still not have reliable electricity, or safe drinking water, or indoor plumbing, or much of anything else, but now many families do have a television. The children look just as malnourished but now they can sing Bollywood songs. Because of this, the people have a greater awareness of the outside world than they did four years ago. And the more they see of the outside world, the less likely Islamic extremism will make inroads in the area, something that it is constantly threatening to do. <br /><br />On the final night of my time in Bhola, I went up to the roof of the orphanage where I was staying and watched a storm roll in over the flat landscape. One of the teachers at the school gathered the children in a circle and sang a slow melodic folk song as the wind swept through the branches of the Khrishnachura trees below. When a lightening bolt would cascade across the sky, the red blossoms of the tree named for a god appeared against the night like tiny orbs of blazing fire. It was one of those moments of beauty and tranquility that, perhaps mistakenly, gives you faith in something that transcends the banalities and tragedies of this world. Bangladesh has a way of reminding you of the fragility of human life. I knew that many people would die in the floods that would follow the storms.  The orphanage on which I stood was itself an artifact of the brutality of life here, built in the aftermath of the 1971 cyclone that killed millions in a matter of days. <br /><br />The moment on the roof was ethereal, but it was I who was the ghost, swooping in from another world to which I would shortly return. Most people here view the United States as akin to Paradise and equally unreachable in this life. Yet, life does goes on. Another child is born. Another dies of fever in the middle of the night. And another still is given a chance at making more of herself than the world ever intended. I’m glad I have stayed involved in the community since I left, organizing a program that has given some young adults the chance at a university education and a better life. The misery of the people here is only matched by their potential to rise above it.<br /><br />I learned later that a launch similar to the one I had taken just days before capsized in the storm that night and 200 people died. The launch had capsized twice before, killing hundreds, and had been condemned by the river authorities. And yet, it had set out that night overcapacity and understaffed. Ironically, it was the first-class passengers who bore the brunt of the casualties. Trapped in their cabins when the boat capsized, they had no chance to swim ashore, while some of those on the open-air lower decks were permitted a fateful reprieve from death. As I paced nervously on the first-class deck the next night on my way back to Dhaka, afraid to retire to my cabin, I reflected on the strange twists of fate that have left Bangladesh permanently on the lower deck in the world today. Hopefully, the boat won't have to capsize in order for them to someday reach the shore.</blockquote><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom: 0.25em;"></div>
