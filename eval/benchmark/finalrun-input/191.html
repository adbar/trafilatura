<div class="text">I did not change my name when I married and I can't imagine how anyone could. To me, that would be like changing my face; it's such a central part of my identity. It was never even a possibility for me.<BR /><BR />Plus, I can never remember any of the last names of the few friends I have who have changed their last names. I've even met a few parents who forget what their own daughter's last name is after she changes it! It' actually a bit disturbing when someone changes their name, I'm very attached to permanence. I was also surprised to find how happy it made my father when he found out I was keeping my (and his) last name. <BR /><BR />Most men I know seem to think that keeping my last name is admirable. However, my husband's family does not approve. They are too intimidated to say anything to me about it though, and its a good thing, because they don't want to get into an argument with me about a tradition based on women as property!!<BR /><BR />Also, when we have a child, it will have my last name. Both parents are generally equal, but I'm the one that has to carry the dang kid in my body for 9 months, so the balance is shifted in my favor. My husband agrees with that logic.</div>

Jana (<a href="mailto:janataylor@hotmail.com">mail</a>):</div>
<div class="text">I didn't change my last name when I got married, instead my husband took my last name.   He didn't feel all that attached to his last name since his family is scattered, and he knew that I did feel attached to my last name, so it just seemed like the natural choice for us.  But that being said, had he not been receptive to taking my name I would have taken his, or we might have came up with a different new last name for both of us.   We feel stongly that we have the same name that our kids do.  It just seems easier that way, and I wouldn't want anybody to mistakenly think my child was from a broken home.</div>

Kelly:</div>
<div class="text">I view my name as part of my identity, and while I appreciate the "family unity" argument, I also wasn't comfortable with changing my name just because I got married.<BR /><BR />My mother (married in 1969 and a feminist) took Dad's name, and she said it was easier to change her name and it was a man's name anyways.  For me, it's not about it being a man's name, it's about the name I was born with, got used to, practice under and associate myself with. And it also seems a little unfair that the default is that the woman changes her name.  If both change to a new name, that seems much more equitable.<BR /><BR />Unlike some women who kept their names, I have no qualms about being called by my husband's last name, and I occasionally offer that name in social settings for convenience purposes. We get mail with all sorts of combinations of our last names. I do not care what other people call me, I am not bothered in the least to be called by his name -- I simply did not want to change my  name professionally or with my friends and family.<BR /><BR />Children pose a problem.  There is a family unity issue there (of course, I am no less my husband's wife if I do not share his name, so I am no less my child's mother if I do not share her name), but there's also a convenience issue - you'll have to take extra steps to prove that you're the spouse or mother if your name isn't the same.  Therefore, if we have children, we'll review my decision, and perhaps even choose a new last name for all of us.<BR /><BR />FWIW, my name is English and my husband's name is hard to pronounce when read, hard to spell when heard, and is ethnic (and I am not that ethnicity).   He uses my name when we order pizza.</div>

Tracy Wilkinson:</div>
<div class="text">I didn't change my name mostly for practical reasons.  Although my husband's surname is earlier in the alphabet than my own, and is from as good old English stock as my own, no one in New Zealand can spell it accurately.  They also can't spell my first name accurately.  The thought of spending the rest of my life going: <BR /> <blockquote><BR />"No 'e' in Tracy.  Yes, there's an 'e' at the end of [hubby's surname].  But not in Tracy.  And there's no 'a' in the surname.  Yes, there is one in Tracy.  Yes, an 'a' but no 'e'.  In Tracy, not in [hubby's surname]. ...' </blockquote><BR />was just too much for me.    <BR /><BR />Even my husband makes restaurant reservations in my name.  He started doing that even before he proposed.<BR /><BR />There was also the thought of all the hassle of changing my name on all my cards, accounts, email addresses, etc.   And the feminist part of me that said "no one is suggesting that he change his name".  <BR /><BR />Practically it's worked out fine.  I've never had any problems convincing people that we're married, including when we've travelled overseas.  His family and a few of my friends write letters to me addressed with his last name, and I keep meaning to get around to telling them that I haven't changed it.  Occasionally people comment, but never negatively.  <BR /><BR />We haven't had kids.  If we do I think I'll give them both names, with my surname as a middle name.  I will also make sure their first names don't have any alternative spellings.  They can use whatever name they like to make restaurant bookings.  <BR />As to why their surname first - my husband's surname is unusual and I quite like maintaining diversity.</div>

anonymouse (<a href="mailto:Anonymouse@Anonymous.net">mail</a>):</div>
<div class="text">I have been married for just over two years. I had never considered changing my name. I like my last name; I identify with my father; I'm an only child, and I wanted to keep the name around at least one more generation.<BR /><BR />My husband never asked, and it never really occurred to me to change my name. It's also the case that I've published a couple papers, but I don't really respect those publications enough to care. Mostly, I didn't want to be someone else, I wanted to be myself, and I thought that changing my name would make me sad. <BR /><BR />Sometimes I wonder sometimes if it wasn't silly of me to keep it. I feel a bit guilty that people refer to my husband as Mr. Mylastname--I'm the one most involved in our community, the one who signs the bills, and many times people here just assume we have the same name. <BR /><BR />I haven't thought about the kids' name problem yet.<BR /><BR />re: practicality: it's never been an issue for me, but then again, no one misnames me; they misname my husband. Never had any issues with bills or paperwork.</div>

<div class="text">I didn't change my last name because I was just too darn lazy to go through the hassle of changing all of my documents--driver's license, passport, social security card credit cards, etc..  I'm not particularly attached to my name considering it's an arbitrary transliteration of my Korean name.  Actually, my first name isn't the one I was born with, but rather one that was randomly selected by my sister after we arrived in the states.  <BR />I've encountered a small amount of confusion by not having changed my name, but nothing monumental.  Our children have my husband's name because that's convention and I really don't care one way or the other.</div>

Laura (<a href="mailto:liappleman@yahoo.com">mail</a>):</div>
<div class="text">I did not change my name upon marriage because: (1) I had already begun to establish myself as a lawyer with my maiden name;  (2) I liked the sound of my name as it was;  (3) changing my name seemed (and still seems) tantamount to changing my identity.  So, a professional reason, a stylistic one, and a personal one.<BR /><BR />No children as of yet, but they will have my husband's name, I suppose.  Socially, I don't think I'll mind being addressed as Mrs. Husbandslastname, particularly if it reduces confusion with the children.</div>

David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken:</div>
<div class="text">Well, I'm not the party to the marriage whom you addressed, but I took my wife's last name. I'm happy to read Jana's note above, as this is the closest I've come to meeting anybody else who's done the same. Why did we do it? We were set on having the same name in order to signal our attachment and make things less confusing for our children and those who encounter them. We seriously considered inventing a new name, especially as a combination of our names, but none of the possible combinations proved very attractive. In the end, she was more attached to her name and family than I was to mine, and her name was also more aesthetically interesting.</div>

<div class="text">I kept my family name because I consider it part of "who I am." I got married when I was 30, but I would have kept the name even in my 20s, before I started on the career path.  I like the sound of it, and had I taken the mate's name, I would have converted my own into something bovine: Donna Bell.  Ugh.  <BR /><BR />Our two kids have both our last names, which I think makes it easier for future geneologists.  (Besides, my husband <i>insisted </i>they have his last name, too ;-) )I don't buy the argument that we can't signal family unity unless we all share the same name. I think it's pretty clear by our names that we are all from the same family unit.<BR /><BR />I think this has worked out well, and I certainly have no regrets about my or my kids' names. Sometimes I have to take a little extra time to explain to people that we all have different but related last names (like when we make airline reservations), but the only time it bothers me is when I have to have the discussion (over and over)with my own friends, especially those who've known me long before I got married. <BR /><BR />Incidentally, I'm surprised at how few women have commented on this compared to the number of commenters on your previous post for those who changed their names.  Are we really that much in the minority??</div>

Mr. & Ms.:</div>
<div class="text">I'm going to chime in, despite being the wrong gender, as my wife and I both wrestled with the question of which, if either, of us should change names.  We ultimately decided to keep ours.<BR /><BR />Best as I can tell, this has posed a problem once in four years of marriage, and then only a minor one: when checking in at an airport in a small city in the South (and plausible marriage or honeymoon destination), we had this conversation:<BR /><BR />Me: We're both checking in, please.  Two bags.<BR />Agent: Which bag is whose?<BR />Me: Oh, it doesn't matter, we're married.<BR />Agent: Oh...the reservations are in different names.  [starts consulting policy manual]  Do you have your marriage license?<BR />Me: What do we need that for?  The tickets match our IDs.<BR />Agent: Aha!  How exciting.  Congratulations!<BR />Me: [confused]<BR />Agent: How long have you been married?<BR />Me: Uh, a bit over two years.<BR />Agent: [confused]<BR /><BR />We got our boarding passes and made a speedy getaway.<BR /><BR />I see the appeal in the one-name, one-family thing, but it's just not important-seeming enough to be worth the hassle and the inequity.  I suspect that if we have two kids, one will get each name--fairer that way, and I think it can actually be really advantageous for younger siblings not to be automatically lumped with their older siblings.<BR /><BR />But I have no objection to going by Mr. [wife's name], either, and I often use her name for reservations (it's easier to spell).</div>

<div class="text">I married eight years ago and kept my last name.  Our kids have Paul's last name, and contrary to warnings, this has not proved too complicated.  We live in a complicated world of blended families where not everyone has the same last name, so I think the world is used to some texture.  I felt strongly about keeping my name at the time, but over time I can barely remember why.  My daughter (aged 6) wants to change her last name to my last name.  I guess if she wants to when she's older, I don't care, although I think her father might!</div>

Alice Marie Beard:</div>
<div class="text">My husband and I married in 1974. I was 23. I'd never considered any option other than keeping my own name. At the same time, I've always understood and felt comfortable with the knowledge that I am "Mrs. Husband's Name." Our children, 26 and 21, have hyphenated names, with their dad's name first. That way, in case they ever opted to drop my part of their last name, they'd already be alphabetized just fine.<br><br>When I was in high school, we had an exchange student from Chile: Adolfo Henriquez y Chacon (a man who has gone on to become a brilliant petroleum engineer). He spent much of his year in that little small town in Indiana explaining his last name to some rather unworldly Hoosier kids.

Iris Engelson:</div>
<div class="text">I married eight years ago at the age of 36 and never seriously considered changing my name.  Well, that's not entirely accurate:  I'd have considered hyphenating if my husband had wanted to do that (and I'd only have considered it if we BOTH hyphenated).  As it happens, though, the combination of our names wasn't terribly euphonious and neither of us was too keen on making the change.<BR /><BR />Different last names are fairly common in our social circle (we live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in New York City) and the convention we used for our son's name (Firstname Middlename Mylastname Hislastname, with no hyphen) is also fairly common.   Between the different last names and the mutually agreed upon hyphenations, I think that couples in which she took his name might even be in the minority.<BR /><BR />I am entirely in agreement with Eugene's reaction to the idea of name changing:  my answer to 'why did you keep your name?' would probably have to be 'why on earth would I change it?'  The minor inconvenience of having to introduce myself these days as "Iris Engelson, xxxx yyyy's Mom" when calling schools, pediatricians or parents of my son's friends hardly seems a compelling reason to jettison the name I have used all my life.<BR /><BR />On the other hand, I never had a problem with my son's having my husband's last name.  I did want my last name to be included as a middle name, though, and I am careful to include all four names on all official documents, lest I ever have any problems when we are traveling.</div>

<div class="text">I didn't change my name because:<BR />1) I had publications under my maiden name;<BR />2) The paperwork would be a nightmare (including what was then the INS);<BR />3) I am a very different ethicity from my husband, and calling myself by his last name seemed utterly incongrous.<BR /><BR />Our child has my husband's last name, and I don't care if I'm addressed socially as Mrs. (Husband's Last Name), or in reference to our child.</div>

<div class="text">I got married in my mid-20s, and I didn't see any reason to legally change my name. I own quite a few things in my name, and seeing the trouble my mother went through just trying to get my deceased father's name off of deeds and titles would indicate it would be a supreme pain in the ass. Get my Social Security record changed? Get name on diplomas changed? What's the point? That's asking for administrative trouble.<BR /><BR />That said, I don't mind being called Mrs. Husband's Name (and I'm super-traditional. I would prefer to be addressed Mrs. [Husband's first name] [Husband's last name] to Mrs. [my first name] [Husband's last name]... because I like being difficult.) I will introduce myself as Mrs. So-and-so to people who have to deal with our kids. Most people know my last name, though, and so I'm not called Mrs. So-and-so that often. Perhaps when the kids are older.<BR /><BR />I look at it from a purely practical point of view, and don't see why my socially used name(s) must be the same as my legal name. <BR /><BR />In my family: after my father died, my mother remarried. But she didn't change her name upon remarriage. So she's Mrs. Dead-husband's-name. Legally and socially. Only a few people have remarked on it, but most people just accept it. She was married to my Dad before she graduated college, so perhaps she had come to identify it as her own. Or perhaps she didn't want to go through the crap of changing all the paperwork. Or perhaps she wanted to have the same last name as her kids. Or perhaps just pure sentimental reasons. I don't know.<BR /><BR />My middle sister has done as I have -- socially, she goes by husband's name, hasn't changed her legal name. My youngest sister does not go by her husband's name at all. All of us got married in our 20s, after we graduated college (and gotten masters degrees). <BR /><BR />Oh, and none of us have done the hyphenated-name thing to the kids. They have their fathers' last names.</div>

Susan West:</div>
<div class="text">I changed my name several years before I met my husband because I wanted something easy to spell and pronounce. I wasn't likely to change it again (although contrary to what other posters have said, it wasn't that much work in the first place -- in fact it was surprisingly simple). <BR /><BR />I also wasn't likely to take his name because I always thought that was really silly, particularly in the context of a traditional wedding. The bride shows up wearing a hat that makes her look like an alien landed on her head with a veil covering her face (and therefore masking her identity). Carol Springer marries David Anderson, and at the end the officiator introduces "Mr. and Mrs. David Anderson." Where did Carol Springer go? The whole ceremony seems designed to strip the bride of her entire identity through the costumes and the name change -- clearly a reflection of the historical view of women as property. Not my style. <BR /><BR />I do resent when people call my by my husband's name. I find it irksome that they are so presumptuous as to assume that I am subservient to him, and so 1950s that they still apply this default. I recently checked my info on Lexis and found that although the title to our home, and the mortgage for it, are both listed in both of our names, the Lexis database shows me with his last name. Who on earth thought it was their business to give me an entirely new name? Makes me crazy. <BR /><BR />Our daughter has my last name. We never considered any other option. It would have been the same if she'd been a son. My husband's parents would have been apoplectic over this if they hadn't been so relieved to finally have a grandchild. Given how unlikely this was to happen at all, they would have been delighted if we'd named her Baby Doe. <BR /><BR />My husband thought about taking my last name, but ultimately I didn't want him to because no one would have believed that he had taken my name rather than that I had taken his. I wanted the names to be different so that my identity was never subsumed under his. <BR /><BR />We've never had problems being treated as a family, even though we have different last names, and no one has ever assumed (out loud anyway) that our daughter is not legitimate. This may come from us being older parents (late 30s when she was born) and having been married for many years before her arrival. But who knows what people are really thinking (and frankly, who cares).</div>

<div class="text">I didn't change my name because I couldn't think of any good reason to change it that wouldn't equally apply to my husband.   (As we ultimately divorced, I'm glad I didn't have the hassle of deciding whether to keep his name or revert to my old one, but "it's one less hassle if we divorce" was <b>not</b> one of my reasons.)  We did consider both taking a new surname, and even had a name that we agreed on, but he felt it would be too expensive to do a name change that his home country would accept, so we both kept our names.  Our son's name is hyphenated; we find that the hypenated last name is no big deal, certainly not nearly as much trouble as the boy's having four middle names (traditional in father's home country)!<BR /><BR />If I should marry again, I'm not planning to take my husband's name, unless he happens to have my maternal grandmother's rare surname. I'll be happy for both of us to hyphenate our names together or to change to a different surname; he can even take my surname if he really wants to.</div>

<div class="text">I got married at 24 and never considered changing my name. My son has his dad's last name, first because it wasn't that big a deal to me and second because my family name is carrying on courtesy of two other nephews and a horde of cousins, whereas my son is the only son of an only son. (His middle name, which is also the name he goes by, is my family name.)<BR /><BR />Names are fundamental to identity for me. I've used the same <i>online</i> name for years and would have a huge problem changing it, never mind the one I was born with. <BR /><BR />For the life of me I can't see what issues are involved with family members having different last names. Legal or bureaucratically, I've never spent 5 seconds extra because my son has his dad's name and I don't.<BR /><BR />The "family unity" argument has never made any sense to me, either. It's supposed to convince outsiders that the spouses really do love each other, or what?<BR /><BR />I don't really care whether women change their name or not, but for some reason I go absolutely nuts at women who say "Oh, I couldn't <i>wait</i> to change my name! I've always hated it!" Smackdown time.</div>

Rebecca (<a href="mailto:radarcy@hotmail.com">mail</a>):</div>
<div class="text">I am getting married in September and I intend to change my last name to my husband's name. I am a practicing attorney and I think the name change will initially be impractical for my colleagues, but I suppose that's just life. I considered not changing my name, but in the end it was important to me to be his wife not just his best friend and partner. In my mind, assuming the same last name is a symbol of a couple's unity that goes beyond their partnership and commitment. I don't feel as though I am becoming a member of his family as much as he and I are becoming our own family. Sharing a name is a strong symbol of the indisolubility of our marriage. Concededly, the same end would have been achieved by him taking my name, but I simply prefer his name.</div>

<div class="text">I'm married to a Japanese woman. My father-in-law changed his name to my mother-in-law's name, because she had no brothers, while he had brothers. By changing his name, he could continue the family line of his wife, my mother-in-law. This is fairly common in Japan, at least in rural areas.<BR /><BR />My wife changed her name to mine. Having a non-Japanese name presents some hassles for her, but having a name different from her husband would present another set of hassles. The Japanese wife of a UK friend of mine stuck with her maiden name for a few years, but gave in when they had children. The Japanese wife of a US friend uses her maiden name as a sort of professional name, but her legal name is her husband's.</div>

<div class="text">I am about-to-be-50, and got married at age 34.  I kept my name for several reasons:  professional license (law), attachment to my family, preservation of my family name, and a husband who couldn't understand why I'd consider changing it.  In spite of all-but-the-last factor, I would have considered having us both change to a new name, but my husband had no intention of changing his name.<BR /><BR />We agreed before we had kids that girls would have my name and boys his.  (My husband got the idea from reading about a tribe somewhere that took this approach.)  As it happened, we had two girls.  My husband doesn't mind -- his family and its name are very widespread, so he didn't feel the need to beget more Hagers.<BR /><BR />When our first daughter was born, the hospital made him sign a form saying something to the effect of "I know it'll be a hassle if we change our minds later about the baby's last name".  He was outraged that they would treat the use of the mother's name so differently from the more usual use of the father's name.</div>

Elizabeth:</div>
<div class="text">I consider my name part of who I am, and to change it after marriage would have been changing who I am.  My husband actually seemed pleased I was keeping my name, I think for similar reasons.  The woman he married is the same woman he dated.<BR /><BR />Any children we have will bear his name.  Not so much because he's the male, but because he's the only son of an only son, whereas I have a brother who's children will likely carry my family name.  Besides, his name is much rarer than mine to begin with and it'd be a shame for it to disappear.</div>

David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken:</div>
<div class="text">I mentioned above that I'd changed my name to my wife's name. One additional thought: it has been harder for me to change my name legally than it would've been for my wife. I still have one credit card with my "maiden" name on it (anybody have a good term for that?) because the out-of-state bank (Chase) will not accept a Michigan marriage license as proof of a name change even though Michigan explicitly permits names to be changed either way (or hyphenation, etc.) with no further documentation. Interestingly, Citibank had no problem with it. Perhaps I should add that I've been carrying this non-id-matching card for almost ten years now, as our tenth anniversary is next month. Every once in a while I try to change it.</div>
