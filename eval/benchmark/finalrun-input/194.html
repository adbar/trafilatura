<b>Statement of Stuart K. Pratt, Consumer Data Industry Association</b></p>
<p>The Consumer Data 
Industry Association (CDIA) is pleased to submit written testimony in connection 
with a hearing on the misuse of Social Security numbers and we thank Chairman 
Shaw for holding this hearing.  CDIA has appeared in person before this 
subcommittee before and we hope our testimony will be helpful to you.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title>[1]</a></p>
<p>Founded in 1906, 
the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), formerly known as Associated 
Credit Bureaus, is the international trade association that represents more than 
500 consumer data companies.  CDIA members represent the nation’s leading 
institutions in credit reporting, mortgage reporting, check verification, fraud 
prevention, risk management, employment reporting, tenant screening and 
collection services.  </p>

<p>Consumer reporting 
agencies are careful stewards of personal information and they adhere to strict 
procedures outlined in federal and state laws.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title>[2]</a>  
The information infrastructure of the consumer reporting system is the backbone 
of the consumer credit economy.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title>[3]</a>  </p>

<p>Our members have a 
strong interest in the legitimate and lawful use of all information, including 
Social Security numbers.  Used properly, SSNs play a substantial role in 
reducing fraud, enhancing workplace security, promoting public safety, 
supporting homeland defense, reducing state and federal entitlement fraud, 
enhancing child support enforcement, and facilitating commerce to a diverse, 
mobile electronic society.  </p>

<p>Before I 
specifically address how the SSN is used by our industry and the importance of 
this number, I have found it helpful to provide a short review of what a 
consumer reporting agency is, what is contained in a consumer report, and the 
law that governs our industry.</p>

<p><b>CONSUMER 
REPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS</b></p>

<p>Consumer reporting 
agencies maintain information on individual consumer payment patterns associated 
with various types of credit obligations on approximately 190 million 
Americans.  The data compiled by these agencies is used by creditors and others 
permitted under the strict prescriptions of the FCRA.</p>

<p>Consumer credit 
histories are derived from, among other sources, the voluntary provision of 
information about consumer payments on various types of credit accounts or other 
debts from thousands of data furnishers such as credit grantors, student loan 
guarantee and child support enforcement agencies. A consumer's file may also 
include public record items such as a bankruptcy filing, judgment or lien.  Note 
that these types of data sources often contain SSNs, as well.</p>

<p>For purposes of 
data accuracy and proper identification, generally our members maintain 
information such as a consumer's full name, current and previous addresses, 
Social Security Number (when voluntarily provided by consumers) and places of 
employment. This data is loaded into the system on a regular basis to ensure the 
completeness and accuracy of data.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title>[4]</a></p>

<p>It is interesting 
to note that the vast majority of data in our members' systems simply confirms 
what most of you would expect; that consumers pay their bills on time and are 
responsible, good credit risks. This contrasts with the majority of systems 
maintained in other countries, such as Japan or Italy, which store only negative 
data and do not give consumers recognition for the responsible management of 
their finances. </p>

<p>As important as 
knowing what we have in our files is also knowing what types of information our 
members <u>do not</u> maintain in files used to produce consumer reports. Our 
members do not know <u>what</u> consumers have purchased using credit (e.g., a 
refrigerator, clothing, etc.) or <u>where</u> they used a particular bank card 
(e.g., which stores a consumer frequents). They also don't have a record of <u>
when</u> consumers have been declined for credit or another benefit based on the 
use of a consumer report. Medical treatment data isn't a part of the databases 
and no bank account information is available in a consumer report. </p>

<p><b>THE FAIR CREDIT 
REPORTING ACT (FCRA)</b></p>

<p>In addition to our general discussion of the industry, we believe it is 
important for your Subcommittee to have a baseline understanding of the law 
which regulates our industry.</p>

<p>Enacted in 1970, 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act was significantly amended in the 104th Congress 
with the passage of the Credit Reporting Reform Act.</p>

<p>Congress, our 
Association's members, creditors and consumer groups spent over six years 
working through the modernization of what was the first privacy law enacted in 
this country (1970). This amendatory process resulted in a complete, current and 
forwarding-looking statute. The FCRA serves as an example of successfully 
balancing the rights of the individual with the economic benefits of maintaining 
a competitive consumer reporting system so necessary to a market-oriented 
economy.</p>

<p>The FCRA is an 
effective privacy statute, which protects the consumer by narrowly limiting the 
appropriate uses of a consumer report (often we call this a credit report) under 
Section 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681b), entitled “Permissible Purposes of Reports.”</p>

<p>Some of the more 
common uses of a consumer's file are in the issuance of credit, subsequent 
account review and collection processes. Reports are also, for example, 
permitted to be used by child support enforcement agencies when establishing 
levels of support. </p>

<p>Beyond protecting 
the privacy of the information contained in consumer reports, the FCRA also 
provides consumers with certain rights such as the right of access; the right to 
dispute any inaccurate information and have it corrected or removed; and the 
right to prosecute any person who accesses their information for an 
impermissible purpose.  The law also includes a shared liability for data 
accuracy between consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of information to 
the system. </p>

<p><b>SOCIAL SECURITY 
NUMBER USES</b></p>

<p>Let me now turn to 
the question of how our industry uses the SSN.</p>

<p>Under the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act, our industry has a duty to “…employ reasonable procedures 
to ensure the maximum possible accuracy…” of the consumer report.  Further, we 
must design systems that accurately allow our customers to extract <u>only</u> 
the data requested on a specific individual.</p>

<p>We must accomplish 
this dual mission of accuracy both in terms of building databases, but also 
properly identifying files in our systems in the context of a highly mobile 
society.  Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately 16% of the nation's population moves 
each year according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which means many addresses change 
each year.  (This equates to approximately 42 million Americans)</li>
  <li>Based on National Center for Health Statistics, it 
is estimated that there are 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces 
annually.  This event frequently triggers changes in addresses as well as last 
names.</li>
  <li>In 1998 there were 6 million homes in the U.S. that are considered 
  vacation or second homes.  Consumers often switch billing addresses if 
  they stay at such residences for long periods of time and in some cases 
  maintain billing addresses for both residences with various creditors.  
  (Source: U.S. Census Bureau House Vacancy Survey as extrapolated by the 
  National Association of Realtors)</li>
</ul>

<p>These data clearly 
speak to the challenge our members face where identifying data often changes. 
</p>

<p>In light of the 
mobility of our society, the Social Security Number plays a very significant 
role in ensuring data quality.  Our members process 2 billion data elements a 
month.  These elements are a combination of credit history data and identifying 
information.  Consider the following very real example.  </p>

<p>Where a consumer 
has changed a last name due to marriage or divorce and has moved to a new 
address, which is common in either case, the SSN is the most stable identifying 
element in the file.  First, it helps us to identify the consumer's file with 
precision during this life transition where he or she is likely applying for new 
credit, seeking approval for utilities, and seeking to rent or purchase a new 
residence.   The consumer expects that the consumer report will be available for 
all of these necessary transactions and the SSN helps our members to meet this 
expectation.  Second, the consumer expect his or her file to be accurate and the 
SSN helps us to maintain the file accurately even when the consumer is in the 
midst of updating creditors with changes in name and address.</p>
<p>The SSN is also a 
critical element in producing information products, which are commonly called 
locator services.  These services are made available, for example, to child 
support enforcement agencies for purposes of locating non-custodial parents;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title>[5]</a> 
to pension funds which must locate beneficiaries; to law enforcement for 
locating criminals or witnesses;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title>[6]</a> 
to healthcare providers that must locate individuals who have chosen not to pay 
their bills, to state benefits agencies to reduce public assistance fraud,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title>[7]</a> 
and for other similar uses.  </p>

<p>Further, the SSN 
plays a role in fraud prevention products.  Where a consumer makes application 
for a product or service, information products that help the business to ensure 
that they are doing business with the right consumer use information products to 
authenticate or verify the application information.  This is true in both for 
bricks-and-mortar business and in e-Commerce.</p>

<p>If applicant data 
does not match, then the business can take additional steps to verify the 
consumer's identity and thus prevent fraud.</p>

<p><b>FRAUD 
PREVENTION AND IDENTITY THEFT</b></p>

<p>In your press 
release announcing this hearing, you mention the potential for misuse of the SSN.  
Our industry has a history of bringing forward initiatives to address fraud.  
These efforts focus on the use of new technologies, and better procedures and 
education.  CDIA and its members have a long history of being leading innovators 
of identity fraud solutions.  The attachment provides a short thumbnail of our 
involvement in identity fraud remediation since 1993.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title>[8]</a> 
</p>

<p><b>CONCLUSION</b></p>

<p>In conclusion, you 
can see by our actions that in large part our uses of the SSN are governed under 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, one of the most extensive privacy laws in the 
country.  Beyond law, our members have a history of proactively limiting how 
SSNs are used outside of the FCRA.  No one particular element of information is 
the key to identity theft.  The underlying theme in all of this is balance. 
</p>
<p>Laws that 
overreach in attempting to limit use of the SSN are likely to merely take fraud 
prevention tools out of the hands of legitimate businesses at the expense of 
consumers.  Ironically, to prevent fraud you must be able to crosscheck 
information.  To maintain accurate databases, you must be able to maintain a 
range of identifying elements.  Absent the availability of the SSN, we will be 
less able to build accurate data bases, to accurately identify records and to 
help prevent the very crime through the development of fraud prevention and 
authentication tools.  </p>

<p>Thank you for this 
opportunity to offer testimony.  CDIA is available to assist your and your 
committee at any time.</p>

<p align="center"><i><b>Consumer Reporting Agency Responses to Identity Fraud</b></i></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<p>

  1993.  Consumer Data Industry 
Association, then known as Associated Credit Bureaus, formed a Fraud and 
Security Task Force.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

  <li>
<p>1998.  Creation of True Name Fraud 
Task Force led by former Vermont Attorney General M. Jerome Diamond.   The work 
of the task force included meetings with law enforcement, consumer 
organizations, privacy advocates, legislators and staff, victims, and others.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>

  <li>
<p>The capstone of the True Name 
Fraud Task Force was a series of initiatives announced in March 2000.  These 
initiatives meant the consumer reporting industry was the first industry to step 
forward and not only educate its members about the problems consumers 
experienced, but to seek specific changes in business practices.  The 
initiatives are to:</p>
<ul>

  <li>Advocate the use and improve the 
effectiveness of security alerts through the use of codes transmitted to 
creditors. These alerts and codes can help creditors avoid opening additional 
fraudulent accounts.</li>
  <li>Implement victim-assistance best 
practices to provide a more uniform experience for victims when working with 
personnel from multiple fraud units.</li>
  <li>Assist identity theft victims by 
sending a notice to creditors and other report users when the victim does not 
recognize a recent inquiry on the victim's file. </li>
  <li>Execute a three-step uniform 
response for victims who call automated telephone systems: automatically adding 
security alerts to files, opting the victim out of prescreened credit offers, 
and sending a copy of his or her file within three business days.</li>
  <li>Launch new software systems that 
will monitor the victim's corrected file for three months, notify the consumer 
of any activity, and provide fraud unit contact information.</li>
  <li>Fund, through CDIA, the 
development of a series of consumer education initiatives through CDIA to help 
consumers understand how to prevent identity theft and also what steps to take 
if they are victims.</li>
</ul></p>
  </li>
  <li>2001.  CDIA announced a 
  police report initiative so that when a police report is provided as part of 
  the process of disputing fraudulent data, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion 
  will block these disputed items from appearing on subsequent consumer reports 
  regarding that individual. 
  </ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>“Another collaborative 
    effort with tremendous promise is your new police report initiative...I 
    appreciate that certain consumer-based initiatives require you to balance 
    accuracy issues - knowing that the consumer’s report contains all relevant 
    credit information, including derogatory reports - against customer 
    service.  From my perspective, your police report initiative strikes just 
    the right balance.”   <i>J. Howard Beales, III, Director of the FTC’s Bureau 
    of Consumer Protection, before the Consumer Data Industry Association.  Jan. 17, 2002.

    </li>
  </ul>
  </blockquote>
<ul>

  <li>2002-03. ID Fraud Victim 
  Data Exchange.  CDIA and its members committed in 2002 to start a pilot test 
  in early-2003 so that when an ID fraud victim calls any one of the 
  participating credit reporting agencies, the victim will be notified that his 
  or her identifying information will be shared by the receiving credit 
  reporting agency with the other two participating credit reporting agencies 
  and that the following steps will be taken by each recipient of the victim’s 
  information:</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <ul type="circle">
    <li>A temporary security 
    alert will be added to the victim’s file.  This security alert will be 
    transmitted to all subsequent users (e.g., creditors) which request a copy 
    of the file for a permissible purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act.</li>
    <li>The victim will be 
    opted out of all non-initiated offers of credit or insurance. </li>
    <li>The CRA will ensure 
    that a copy of the victim’s file is in the mail within three business days 
    of the victim’s request.</li>
  </ul></p>
  <li>Our efforts are paying 
  off.  
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <ul type="circle">
    <li><i>Most calls are 
    prevention related</i>.  CDIA members 
    report a majority of consumers who contact fraud units are taking 
    preventative steps and are not reporting a crime.</li>
    <li><i>Victims are 
    learning of the fraud earlier</i>.  
    According to an FTC report in June 2001, 42% of victims learn about the 
    crime within 30 days or less, a full 10% less than than in the prior 
    report.  CDIA estimates another 35% lean of the crime within one to six 
    months and 7% learn of the crime in six months to a year.</li>
    <li><i>Victimization of 
    the elderly is dropping</i>.  In 
    2001, the FTC estimated that 6.3% of identity fraud victims were over 65, a 
    5% decrease from 2000.</li>
