	  <h1>Leadership Lessons: Negotiating for Success - Basic Stages (Part 1 in 
		a series of 3)</h1>
	  <p>Everyone negotiates. We negotiate with family members about how to spend 
		vacation time; we negotiate with friends about how to pick up the tab 
		for dinner; we negotiate with contractors about when to come to the house 
		for a delivery or repairs. Physicians negotiate with patients when discussing 
		alternatives of medical versus surgical therapy or, often times, no therapy. 
		Scientists negotiate for time and space to conduct experiments. All of 
		us negotiate for salary and job responsibilities. While each of these 
		examples has a different level of risk and impact on the outcome, each 
		requires basic communication skills to be effective. </p>
	  <p>Richard Shell, in his book, Bargaining for Advantage (Penguin Books, 
		1999) defines negotiation as &quot;an interactive communication process 
		that may take place whenever we want something from someone else or another 
		person wants something from us.&quot; Shell describes the process in four 
		stages: Preparation, Exchanging Information, Bargaining, and Closing and 
		Commitment. </p>
	  <p>This article explores the four phases using examples from common interactions 
		of faculty negotiating for new positions in medical schools. The examples 
		are drawn in part from vignettes discussed during sessions on negotiation 
		during the 2004 AAMC Annual Meeting and the 2004 Executive Development 
		Seminar for Associate Deans and Chairs. </p>

	  <h3>Preparation </h3>
	  <p>Dr. Steven Blum, in his instruction on negotiation during this year's 
		AAMC Executive Development Series, reiterates: You will be a better negotiator 
		if you prepare thoroughly. Simple advice, but worth emphasizing. Preparation 
		includes researching standards and principles by which negotiating parties 
		may reach common ground. Preparation includes knowledge of your own values 
		on the issue being negotiated as well as knowledge of the perceived needs 
		and values of the other parties involved in the discussion. It is important 
		to be aware of your own bargaining style as well as that of the other 
		party. (More on bargaining styles-avoidance, compromise, accommodation, 
		competition, and problem solving in subsequent issues of <i>Faculty Vitae</i>)</p>
	  <h3>Exchanging Information</h3>
	  <p>This is the single most important stage of negotiation. In 1978, a study 
		of English labor and contract negotiators engaged in actual transactions 
		showed that successful negotiators asked twice the number of questions 
		and spent over twice the amount of time acquiring and clarifying information 
		than did average negotiators. (Referenced in Shell, Bargaining for Advantage).

	  <p>Many observational studies since 1978 have confirmed the importance of 
		these basic communications skills in effective negotiation. Henry Ford 
		gave advice on such communication: "If there is any one secret of success" 
		he said, "it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view 
		and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own." Why 
		are communication skills so important in this particular kind of interaction? 
		Shell surmises, "Most people are so grateful to have an attentive audience 
		that they take little notice of your tactful probing until they suddenly 
		feel the urge to get a few answers themselves. By then the effective negotiator 
		has the information he or she needs to frame just the right responses."

	  <p>When Dr. Timothy Johnson investigated the position as Chair of Obstetrics 
		and Gynecology at the University of Michigan, he interviewed a variety 
		of decision-makers within the department and the medical school. The result 
		of the conversations and his reflection upon what possible to build in 
		the medical school was an 18-page vision and planning document. This document 
		reflected the visions and possibilities of the department and the medical 
		school and required very little negotiation to reach agreement because 
		of the shared interests and common ground for those with whom he would 
		eventually develop the vision. And how did he discover the shared interests 
		and the potential for building a great department? Through inquiry, listening, 
		clarifying, and developing shared interests. </p><br>

	  <h3>Bargaining</h3>
	  <p>Bargaining is the stage that most people associate with negotiation. 
		However, this stage alone is NOT negotiating. It begins with an exchange 
		of terms, an opening of the discussion of a "deal". Dr. Steve Blum teaches 
		AAMC EDS participants to delay this stage as long as reasonable, but to 
		recognize when it begins. He teachers, "As soon as a number or term is 
		mentioned by one party, you have begun to move out of information exchange 
		and into bargaining." In negotiations that have proceeded well through 
		the stage of information exchange, this transition occurs smoothly as 
		a natural extension of how to enact the ideas that have emerged. If exchange 
		is done effectively, both parties are likely to have discovered a number 
		of different resolutions that are more attractive than the ideas brought 
		to the initial discussion by either party. </p>
	  <table width="168" border="0" align="right" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5">
		<tr> 
		  <td style="border:1px solid #039"> 
			<p><img src="/members/facultydev/images/fennerthorson.jpg" width="200" height="176" hspace="5"></p>
			<p class="sm" align="center"><b>Drs. Dee Fenner and Jayne Thorson 
			  of the University of Michigan College of Medicine. &quot;Ask for 
			  what you need and aim high.&quot;</b></p>
		  </td>
		</tr>
	  </table><p>Both parties are also more likely to be pleased with their final transaction 
		if they come to the discussion with their very best case scenario in mind. 
		The old adage "think positive" is the right one for negotiation. King 
		Ching of Chou in the 12th century is reported to have said, "High achievement 
		comes from high aims." When negotiating, think about meeting mutual needs 
		and desires with complementary solutions. Of course, one must prepare 
		well by knowing the bottom line, or Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. 
		(We will talk more about BATNA in a subsequent issue.) And, of course 
		it is important to know one's values so as not to compromise them. However, 
		the best bargaining will result in all parties feeling as though they 
		have acquired value and lost little or none. This happens when the negotiators 
		spend sufficient time prior to the bargaining stage to discover common 
		ground on values and mutual benefit in exchanging properties or ideas. 
	  </p>
	  <p>The substantive changes in curriculum that are becoming established across 
		the nation are the results of effective negotiation with many individuals 
		with many interests. The "bargain" is often a method of increasing one 
		department's visibility in return for support for more dispersed or integrated 
		teaching. Often, this requires negotiation of a new method of distributing 
		funds to departments to recognize teaching effort and always a consideration 
		of how these new distribution methods impact upon departmental and divisional 
		budgeting. Each of these is a result of a bargaining process that builds 
		into the larger vision of more effective teaching, learning, and organizational 
		innovation.</p>
	  <h3>Closing and Commitment</h3>
	  <p>When various options have been fully explored, weighted by each party, 
		and often adjusted, closing may occur. Blum tells us that we obtain true 
		commitment from the other party "when the alternatives are not as attractive 
		as following through on the deal. " In an effective negotiation, both 
		parties will come to this point of best possible combination of terms 
		in a similar time frame. </p>
	  <p>Robert Frost said, "Good fences make good neighbors." A strong and visible 
		closing and definition of terms facilitates an ongoing, trustworthy relationship. 
		One might say of bargaining, "a good contract makes a good bargain-and 
		a potential long term relationship that will continue to benefit both 
		parties. In the Unites States, a symbolic handshake signifies a verbal 
		agreement. Signing a contract or memorandum of understanding or placing 
		funds in escrow shows good faith intention to follow through on the agreement. 
		A public announcement such as a press release or presentation at an important 
		meeting gives credence to the plan.</p>
	  <h3>Summary</h3>
	  
	  
	  <p>&quot;In the last analysis, you cannot learn negotiating techniques from 
		a book. You must actually negotiate.&quot;<br />
		- Freund, Anatomy of a Merger 1975 </p>
		
	  <p>The best way to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to be conscious 
		of your own opportunities and consciously work to improve your skill. 
		Blum credits Shell in teaching that effective negotiators share similar 
		characteristics. They all:<br>
 
	  <ol>
		<li>engage in systematic planning and preparation</li>
		<li>have high expectations</li>
		<li>maintain a reputation for reliability and integrity</li>
		<li>exhibit strong listening skills, knowledge of subject matter, verbal 
		  skills and self-confidence.</li>
	  </ol>
	  <p>Fortunately, these are all characteristics that are important for academic 
		success as well. Whether your focus is clinical care, educational innovation, 
		or scientific research, you likely have developed considerable foundation 
		in each of these skills and traits. Using the four stages, you should 
		be able to enhance your negotiation effectiveness. At the 2004 AAMC Annual 
		meeting, Drs. Jayne Thorson, Tim Johnson, and Dee Fenner from the University 
		of Michigan College of Medicine shared some basic tips for negotiating 
		new positions in academics. All rely on the basic stages of negotiation, 
		stages that Dr. Fenner describes as "a universal dance with four steps."</p>

			<p><b>Tips on negotiating for a new position in academics<br />
			  </b>-- from the WIM Annual Meeting session, Negotiating for your 
			  success Jayne Thorson, Tim Johnson, Dee Fenner </p>
			<ol>
			  <li>Know what you need to meet your goals and establish targets 
				of 6 months, one year, five years. In discussing a new position, 
				be sure to address the metrics by which success is measured in 
				the new organization. Ask questions that require a concrete response: 
				<ul>
				  <li>If I were to take this position, what actions or outcomes 
					would make you think of me as a success?</li>
				  <li>Who are the successful people in this organization? Why? 
					(Then you should ask to meet with them.)</li>
				  <li>At the end of one year, two years, five years, how will 
					you judge my success?</li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  <li> Use the responses to #1 to construct a 1, 2, and 5 year plan 
				in writing. Be sure to state your interests and needs rather than 
				making demands. Aim high. Why? "You'll be more likely to hit the 
				target".</li>
			  <li>Find out how decisions are made in the organization. Be sure 
				to negotiate with the person who makes the real decisions.</li>
			  <li>Listen for what is said and what is NOT said. Plan short, clear 
				questions in advance and ask with a purpose. </li>
