        <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>By Michael Vitiello</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size=2><b>T</b></font><font face="Arial" size=2>he 
          1990s were dominated by get-tough-on-crime measures, dramatically increasing 
          the nation’s prison population and the length of prison sentences. Those 
          measures culminated with the enactment of &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          legislation around the nation. Beginning with Washington State in 1993, 
          by the end of the decade, the federal government and over half of all 
          states had enacted some form of a &quot;three strikes&quot; law. Roughly 
          contemporaneous with these measures, crime rates have declined nationwide. 
          Advocates of severe incarceration policies have claimed that &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; laws are responsible for that decline.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Nowhere in the nation are the stakes higher 
          than in California. Called &quot;the biggest penal experiment of its 
          kind in modern American history,&quot; due to its distinctive provisions, 
          California’s &quot;three strikes&quot; law accounts for the vast majority 
          of &quot;three strikes&quot; cases nationwide. Franklin E. Zimring, 
          Gordon<b> </b>Hawkins, and Sam<b> </b>Kamin, Punishment and Democracy: 
          Three Strikes and You’re Out in California at 22 (2001). Its sentence 
          enhancements include not just the widely advertised twenty-five-year-to-life 
          terms for third-strike felons, but also a doubling of the nominal sentence 
          for many second-strike offenders. Further, its provisions include residential 
          burglary as a possible qualifying strike. Finally, the third strike, 
          triggering the twenty-five-year-to-life term of imprisonment, may be 
          any felony. As a result, California accounts for over 90 percent of 
          all &quot;three strikes&quot; sentences<b> </b>nationwide.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Three strikes&quot; advocates in 
          California point to dramatic declines in crime rates since its passage 
          and claim victory. For example, former Attorney General Dan Lungren’s 
          office reported that &quot;[s]ince the passage of ‘Three Strikes,’ . 
          . . the violent crime rate in California has dropped 26.9 percent with 
          a 30.8 percent drop in the six major crime categories.&quot; Office 
          of the Attorney Gen., Cal. Dep’t of Justice, &quot;Three Strikes and 
          You’re Out—Its Impact on the California Criminal Justice System After 
          Four Years 3 (1998).&quot; Secretary of State Bill Jones, who sponsored 
          the &quot;three strikes&quot; legislation as an assemblyman, has suggested 
          that three strikes is responsible for most, if not all, of that drop 
          in crime. Justice James<b> </b>Ardaiz, who assisted in drafting the 
          original bill, is even more explicit: &quot;Crime in California has 
          declined dramatically since 1993. The only things that are different 
          are more police, tougher laws, and Three Strikes. . . . [W]here there 
          are a number of explanations for a given result, the simplest explanation 
          is usually correct. The Three Strikes Law is that explanation.&quot; 
          James A. Ardaiz, <i>California’s Three Strikes Law: History, Expectations, 
          Consequences</i>, 32 McGeorge L. Rev. 1, 35-36. Jones points to additional 
          support for the beneficial role of &quot;three strikes&quot;: while 
          crime rates declined across the nation, the decline in California significantly 
          outstripped that in the rest of the nation. For example, over a six-month 
          period in 1995, crime declined only 1 percent nationwide while it dropped 
          7 percent in California. Jones, <i>Why the Three Strikes Law Is Working 
          in California</i>, 11 Stan. L. &amp; Pol’y Rev. 23, 24 (1999).</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">While commentators disagree about whether 
          the law is theoretically justified, much of the debate focuses on empirical 
          data. If &quot;three strikes&quot; accounts for the dramatic decline 
          in crime, theoretical objections, including moral concerns about its 
          fairness, are not likely to move legislators or the public. And as indicated 
          above, &quot;three strikes&quot; supporters argue that empirical data 
          support their position. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, despite the claims of &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; supporters, the data on which they rely do not withstand 
          close scrutiny. More recent empirical research supports many of the 
          claims of &quot;three strikes&quot; critics that the law simply cannot 
          deliver on its promises and insofar as it may have some marginal deterrent 
          effect, it comes at too high a cost.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Comparing California’s decline in crime 
          with the national average, as Secretary of State Jones does when he 
          asserts that &quot;three strikes&quot; accounts for California exceeding 
          the decline in crime nationwide, cuts both ways. New York, not California, 
          showed the sharpest decline in crime during the time in question. While 
          some of New York’s policing policies have raised serious civil rights 
          concerns, it was not one of the states that adopted a &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          law during the 1990s. Hence, its decline in crime cannot be attributed 
          to such legislation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A number of recently published studies 
          also raise doubts about the true effectiveness of &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          laws in lowering California’s crime rate. For example, within California, 
          counties that aggressively enforce the law &quot;had no greater declines 
          in crime than did counties that used it far more sparingly.&quot; See 
          <i>Crime States Capture Both Arguments,</i> Contra Costa Times, Feb. 
          27, 2000, at A1. One study found that crime dropped by 21.3 percent 
          in the six most lenient &quot;three strikes&quot; counties, compared 
          to a 12.7 percent drop in the toughest counties.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">A recently published book, <i>Punishment 
          and Democracy: Three Strikes and You’re Out in California</i>, reports 
          the results of the most comprehensive study of &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          to date. The authors’ findings suggest that, prior to &quot;three strikes,&quot; 
          crime rates were declining already and, after &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          they continued to decline at about the same rate, suggesting that whatever 
          effect &quot;three strikes&quot; had, it was small at best. The book 
          also notes that, partly because &quot;three strikes&quot; casts such 
          a broad net, the offenders arrested under its provisions were no more 
          likely to be high-rate offenders than non-&quot;three strikes&quot; 
          arrestees. Nor were they more likely to commit violent offenses.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Although its proponents originally explained 
          that &quot;three strikes&quot; would work because it would incapacitate 
          high-rate offenders, the decline in the crime rate came too early to 
          be explained on that basis—&quot;three strikes&quot; is a sentence enhancement 
          provision and the enhancements do not kick in immediately, whereas the 
          decline in the crime rate occurred immediately. As a result, &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; proponents were forced to shift their explanation—the 
          law deterred potential offenders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The authors of <i>Punishment and Democracy</i> 
          attempted to measure the law’s deterrent effect. In certain instances, 
          depending on which method the authors used, they did find a marginal 
          deterrent effect. But the effect was extremely small and cannot explain 
          the significant overall decline in the crime rate. <i>Punishment and 
          Democracy</i> also addressed the claim of the law’s proponents that 
          a sharp decline in the crime rate followed passage of the law. Contrary 
          to this claim, the authors found that the decline in the crime rate 
          preceded passage of the law. Further, were &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          the cause of a significant part of the decline, the rate of decline 
          should have increased after its passage. Instead, the rate of decline 
          remained constant, suggesting that the causes of the decline that were 
          operating prior to the passage of the law continued to be the primary 
          reason for the drop in crime rates.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Empirical studies suggest that California 
          would have experienced virtually all of its decline in crime without 
          &quot;three strikes.&quot; At the same time, &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          will have a significant cumulative effect on the size of the prison 
          population, an expense that will grow over time. One effect will be 
          to increase the number of older prisoners, a group that represents a 
          low social risk because most offenders become less criminally active 
          as they age. Not only are older prisoners not likely to commit crimes 
          if set free, but they cost the state much more to keep incarcerated 
          than younger, healthier offenders.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">None of this comes as a surprise to many 
          commentators who doubted the wisdom of &quot;three strikes,&quot; certainly 
          as it was enacted in California. But none of us who opposed &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; can take much comfort in knowing that our concerns were 
          borne out. The important policy question is how can we reform the law 
          to avoid its excesses?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Few politicians were willing to oppose 
          &quot;three strikes&quot; during its passage. And while most politicians 
          in the past decade have feared being labeled as soft on crime, that 
          fear was exacerbated during the legislation’s passage. Aided by the 
          kidnapping and murder of young Polly Klaas, Mike Reynolds, the father 
          of a murder victim, pushed the bill through the legislature with remarkable 
          resolve. He was unwilling to compromise or allow amendments to the bill 
          (or to a virtually identical ballot initiative). His sway with the legislature 
          was extraordinary, with most afraid that if they opposed him, he would 
          portray them as soft on crime. Since the law’s passage, passions have 
          cooled somewhat. But one legacy of the charged political environment 
          in which the law passed is that its amendment requires a supermajority. 
          As a result, even those few politicians who are now willing to propose 
          amendments face an uphill battle at best. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In theory, both the California and the 
          U.S. Constitutions protect against the imposition of disproportionate 
          criminal penalties. But outside of the death penalty context, that protection 
          is more theoretical than real. During the 1970s and 1980s, the California 
          Supreme Court was active in reviewing indeterminate sentences and developed 
          a body of case law wherein it overturned numerous sentences as excessive 
          in violation of California’s protection against &quot;cruel or unusual 
          punishment.&quot; <i>See</i>, <i>e.g</i>., <i>People v. Dillon, </i>668 
          P.2d 697 (1983). A number of trial courts relied on that case law in 
          striking down some of the more extreme &quot;three strikes&quot; sentences 
          shortly after the law became effective. Despite supreme court precedent 
          and considerable sentiment among trial courts that some &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; sentences were excessive, no California district court 
          of appeal agreed. <i>See</i>, <i>e.g</i>., <i>People v. Ayon,</i> 53 
          Cal. Rptr. 2d 853 (Ct. App. 1996). In light of unanimity among the district 
          courts of appeal, the California Supreme Court has shown no inclination 
          to revisit the question.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">More recently, in a denial of certiorari, 
          four U.S. Supreme Court justices suggested that some &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          sentences might violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel 
          and unusual punishment. <i>Riggs v. California</i>, 525 U.S. 1114 (1999). 
          Since then, the Ninth Circuit has held in three separate cases that 
          a &quot;three strikes&quot; offense violates the Eighth Amendment. <i>Andrade 
          v. Attorney General of California</i>, 270 F.3d 743 (9th Cir. 2001) 
          and see <i>‘Three Strikes’ Ruled Unjust in Shoplifting Convictions—U.S. 
          Appeals Court Decision May Reduce Terms for 340 Inmates,</i> S.F. Chron., 
          Friday, Feb. 8, 2002, at A-1.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Meaningful review of &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          sentences might weed out many of the cases in which twenty-five-year-to-life 
          sentences seem excessive. But two important questions remain. First, 
          even the Ninth Circuit’s decisions may be severely limited in their 
          scope. All three cases decided thus far have involved petty theft as 
          the third strike offense. Under California law, petty theft is a &quot;wobbler,&quot; 
          an offense that may be a misdemeanor or a felony. Under the circumstances 
          of the cases before the court, the offenders’ records have led to the 
          crime being treated as a felony. Once escalated to a felony, the crime 
          becomes the third strike. The effect of the unique features of California’s 
          sentencing laws is that what might be a misdemeanor ends up resulting 
          in a life sentence. If the Ninth Circuit’s approach turns on that feature 
          of the law, the impact of these cases is quite limited, perhaps to as 
          few as 300-350 cases out of over thousands of &quot;three strikes&quot; 
          cases. For example, if so limited, the Ninth Circuit’s approach would 
          offer little hope for an offender whose third strike was a minor possession 
          of narcotics or marijuana offense.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The other important question is whether 
          the Ninth Circuit’s decisions will survive U.S. Supreme Court scrutiny. 
          Earlier this year, the Supreme Court granted California’s petition for 
          a writ of certiorari. As indicated earlier, four justices raised concerns 
          about &quot;three strikes&quot; sentences, again in the context of a 
          theft &quot;wobbler&quot; case. But whether a fifth justice would agree 
          is open to serious question.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The Supreme Court has overturned a term 
          of imprisonment as a violation of the Eighth Amendment in only one case. 
          In <i>Solem v. Helm</i>, 463 U.S. 277 (1983), the Court struck down 
          a true life sentence imposed on a habitual offender whose criminal record, 
          although extensive, did not include any crimes of violence. The offense 
          that triggered the life sentence was for writing a bad check, an offense 
          described by the Court as passive and nonviolent. Although a majority 
          of the Court refused to overrule <i>Helm</i> when it next considered 
          the question, the Court did uphold a true life sentence for possession 
          of more than 650 grams of cocaine. <i>Harmelin v. Michigan,</i> 501 
          U.S. 957 (1991). In addition, prior to <i>Helm</i>, the Court upheld 
          a parolable life sentence in <i>Rummel v. Estelle</i>, 445 U.S. 263 
          (1980), and a sentence of forty years for possession of marijuana in 
          <i>Hutto v. Davis, </i>454 U.S. 370 (1982). Were the Court to apply 
          that case law to &quot;three strikes,&quot; whether it would find any 
          given sentence a violation of the Eighth Amendment is uncertain.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Three strikes&quot; requires a significant 
          minimum sentence, one that can be reduced by at most 20 percent for 
          good time. Hence, a &quot;three strikes&quot; offender must serve a 
          minimum sentence of at least twenty years. That may seem significant, 
          and in some rough sense, disproportionate to an offender’s third-strike 
          offense (for example, possession of a small amount of drugs). But the 
          punishment is less severe than, say, the offender in <i>Hutto v. Davis</i>, 
          whose forty-year sentence was not unconstitutionally excessive. Instead, 
          like Rummel, the offender in <i>Rummel v. Estelle</i>, the offender 
          is not condemned to a true life sentence. Even if the long minimum sentence 
          has the practical effect of a true life sentence—for example, when it 
          is imposed on an older offender who as a practical matter will probably 
          die in prison before serving his entire sentence—the case may not come 
          within <i>Solem v. Helm</i>. While the Court struck down a sentence 
          imposed on a habitual offender, his entire criminal record did not include 
          a crime of violence. At least for those offenders whose earlier crimes 
          have included crimes of violence, their earlier criminal records may 
          be enough to take them out of <i>Helm’</i>s narrow holding. Perhaps 
          an older offender whose minimum sentence may be the equivalent of a 
          life sentence and whose two strikes were residential burglaries and 
          whose third strike is a relatively minor offense, like possession of 
          drugs, could invoke Eighth Amendment protection. But those cases may 
          be too few to have much of an impact on the problem created by &quot;three 
          strikes.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The issue bears watching. Excessive punishment 
          raises serious moral questions. Beyond the moral question, &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; opponents have mounting empirical evidence that &quot;three 
          strikes&quot; cannot deliver on its overblown promises. But legislative 
          reform, difficult under normal circumstance due to politicians’ fears 
          of being labeled soft on crime, is doubly difficult because of the supermajority 
          requirement. We are left hoping that the courts will save us from our 
          own excesses; whether they will is very much up for grabs.</font></p>
