      Each tribe follows the same fertility ritual before bed each night, a ritual 
      that also reveals the number of members in a tribe. In the ritual, each 
      arm of a male links with an arm of a female, no male-female pair of robots 
      linking more than once. The minimum number of robots required to link all 
      arms once only is the number belonging to that tribe. Now one night, the 
      Creaky tribe cornered half of the Rusty tribe and despite being outnumbered 
      two to one, unscrewed one arm from each, there being an equal number of 
      male and female victims. However, the Creaky tribe were extremely poor at 
      arithmetic and had failed to realise that they needed 24 times their actual 
      haul of spare arms in order that the number of links their members could 
      then make, each with the same number of extra arms, was half the maximum
