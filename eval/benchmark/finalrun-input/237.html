The Arizona Association of Bed and Breakfast Inns (the “Association”) was established upon the filing of Articles of Incorporation with the Arizona Corporation Commission.  The operation of the Association shall be regulated by the Articles of Incorporation and by these Bylaws.  The purpose of these Bylaws is to establish a procedure for the operation of the Association.  These Bylaws shall be interpreted and construed in a manner to maintain compliance with the Articles of Incorporation.<br><br>1.2  Purpose of Association.  The Association shall be organized and operated as a nonprofit association for the promotion of bed and breakfast inns (“Inns”) located in the State of Arizona.

The initial Standards are attached hereto and incorporated herein as Exhibit A.  The Standards may be amended by the consent of a majority of the Active Members.<br><br>1.3  Principal Office.  The known place of business shall be located at 3386 N. Hwy 89, Prescott, Arizona 86301, or at such other location designated by the Board of Directors.<br><br>1.4  Corporate Seal.  A corporate seal shall not be requisite to the validity of any instrument executed by or on behalf of the corporation.  However, a corporate seal with the name, date and place of incorporation may be used to verify documents.<br><br>1.5  Reference to Articles.  Any reference herein made to the Corporation’s Articles shall refer to its Articles of Incorporation and all amendments thereto as at any given time on file with the Arizona Corporation Commission.<br><br>1.6  Seniority of Articles.  The statutes of the State of Arizona will in all respects be considered superior to the Articles, with any inconsistency resolved in favor of said statutes.  The statutes and Articles will in all respects be considered senior and superior to these Bylaws, with any inconsistency to be resolved in favor of the statutes and Articles, and with theses Bylaws to be deemed automatically amended from time to time to eliminate any such inconsistency which may then exist.<br><br><u>Article II:  Members</u><br><br>2.1  Membership Classes.

Upon recommendation by that representative, the Board of Directors makes the final decision for approval or denial of membership.  Active Members have the right to vote in the election of Board of Directors and other matters determined by the Members pursuant to these Bylaws or the laws of the State of Arizona.

If annual dues are not received by the Treasurer of the association by December 31st, the Board of Directors may terminate the Active Member inn’s membership in the Association.  Dues for new members will be assessed on a pro-rated basis.  Payment of dues signifies a continuing commitment to uphold the Standards.  An inn that is being re-instated after not paying dues by the deadline is considered to be a new member and requires re-inspection and will be charged the inspection fee as a new member.  Dues will not be refunded, in whole or in part, if an inn ceases to be a member during the year, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.  Member inns which have changed ownership must apply as a new member within sixty (60) days and be inspected.  The new owners must pay for the inspection.
