              <span class="grey">Arms Control in Crisis and Disarmament at a Turning Point?</span></h3>
            <p>Today indicators for disarmament and conversion signal stagnation 
              or even a reversal for the first time in over a decade. It seems 
              that disarmament is at a turning point: arms control negotiations 
              are in a crisis; efforts at conflict prevention and conflict resolution 
              are a mixed bag of successes and failures; and conversion has slowed 
              down. Despite this there is still much conversion work ahead, especially 
              in reintegrating demobilized armed forces personnel and redundant 
              defense industry workers in Eastern Europe as well as in military 
              base redevelopment.</p>
            <p>This introduction will look at the reasons for the crisis in arms 
              control negotiations, will summarize the findings of disarmament 
              and conversion trends, will draw attention to ongoing wars and conflict 
              resolution efforts as well as to the prevailing trend of opting 
              for a military solution to conflicts, and will, finally, draw conclusions, 
              identifying possible future ways of revitalizing the disarmament 
              and conversion process.</p>
            <p><span class="bolditalic">Crisis in arms control negotiations</span><b><i> 
              </i></b></p>
            <p>A number of failed or stagnating negotiations on weapons of mass 
              destruction symbolize the depth of the crisis in international arms 
              control. But paradoxically, up to now, the crisis of institutionalized 
              (negotiated) arms control has not led to the complete end of disarmament. 
              Arms control of the classical type between opposing blocs of military 
              alliances has been in crisis since the mid-nineties. However, in 
              contrast to <i>negotiated </i>arms control, disarmament can be carried 
              out either on the basis of an arms control agreement, or unilaterally. 
              Disarmament reduces military forces numerically (weapons, military 
              personnel, etc.) and/or military power and renders conversion necessary: 
              as long as financial, human and material resources are being freed 
              from the military sector, there is also a need to convert them in 
              order to avoid unnecessary social or economic effects or adverse 
              political reactions. </p>
            <p>Despite the highly visible gridlock in arms control negotiations, 
              governments have reduced their military forces substantially: weapon 
              systems have been decommissioned, troops demobilized, arms production 
              capacities reduced, military bases redeveloped for non-military 
              purposes, and military expenditures cut. The numerical reduction 
              of military forces has actually been happening until recently and 
              is continuing in a number of countries and in certain sectors, but 
              the year 2000 may prove to be a turning point in numerical, quantitative 
              disarmament.</p>
            <p>How serious is the decoupling of actual disarmament from institutionalized 
              arms control? Will governments continue to disarm unilaterally and 
              convert military resources to non-military use as they did in the 
              second half of the nineties or will this decoupling process put 
              an end to disarmament and conversion? What can arms control do to 
              curb the currently prevailing intra-state armed conflicts and how 
              effectively can it do this? What priorities are necessary to make 
              arms control a facilitator of future disarmament and conversion?</p>
            <p>Despite the crisis in arms control there have recently been successful 
              arms control agreements. Arguably, the most important <font color="#000000">one 
              was the extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in May 1995 
              and the NPT Review Conference in April/May 2000. Unfortunately, 
              this success story is called into question by the actual behavior 
              of the nuclear weapon states, who have not come to terms on a comprehensive 
              test ban or a fissile material ban, let alone complete nuclear disarmament—a 
              requirement of the NPT. Another accomplishment was the Ottawa Convention 
              banning anti-personnel mines, which took place outside the classical 
              forums of arms control. Similar efforts stimulated by the landmine 
              convention are now being undertaken to control the proliferation 
              and excessive accumulation of small arms and light weapons.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Two aspects underlying the crisis of traditional 
              arms control require particular attention: the increasing military 
              dominance of the United States; and changed perceptions of military 
              threats.</font></p>
            <p class="bolditalic"><span class="grey">Hegemonic superpower</span> 
            </p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Many post-Cold War arms control agreements 
              were made possible because the Soviet Union, and later Russia, were 
              in a weak position. The possible revitalization of Russia was seen 
              in the United States and NATO as a realistic option. Reductions 
              in military postures both in NATO and in Russia were therefore perceived 
              as mutually beneficial. But with the continuing disintegration of 
              the Russian military and the obvious loss of Russia’s status as 
              a military superpower, the US interest in strategic stability through 
              bilateral arms control diminished; the bilateral superpower relations 
              shifted to a clear and growing US dominance. Increasingly, with 
              the Soviet threat gone, the United States believes it can control 
              smaller states militarily, even if these states aim at nuclear capabilities 
              or other types of weapons of mass destruction. The US concept is 
              increasingly focusing on limiting the weapon systems of other countries 
              without limiting its own room for action as the only global military 
              power. This is most clearly illustrated by its plans for a National 
              Missile Defense system.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">This policy has long-term consequences. The 
              limits of classical arms control demonstrate the logic of the well-known 
              security dilemma. Wherever a hegemony exists or armaments are asymmetrically 
              distributed, arms control is likely to come to a stand-still. The 
              ‘haves’ do not see an incentive to give up their superior position, 
              and stimulate arms acquisition among the ‘have-nots’ just by defending 
              their superiority. Nevertheless, unilateral disarmament or regional 
              confidence-building can create trust and may instill a sense of 
              assurance, spilling over into further rounds of arms control (‘disarmament 
              spill-over’). It is still too early to judge whether the disarmament 
              of the nineties will prove to be self-sustaining or will be reversed, 
              as some indicators tend to suggest.</font></p>
            <p class="bolditalic"><span class="grey">New military threats: new 
              forms of arms control</span></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Many countries have started to reassess military 
              threats and, consequently, the structure of their armed forces. 
              The number of long-range military interventions has increased. Multilateral 
              UN peace-keeping missions have moved to center stage in the discussion 
              of new and future military missions. Regional and internal wars 
              have become the focus of attention. This has not only entailed preparation 
              for such missions, but also required that the weapons primarily 
              used in such wars— landmines, small arms and light weapons —be placed 
              on the international arms control agenda.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#000000">Classical arms control, as it developed during 
              the Cold War, has proved inadequate for the new situation. Clearly, 
              the central problem in wars of today is not the lack of international 
              stability but the destructiveness of the weapons and their enormous 
              cost. The most prominent example of the emerging reorientation of 
              arms control are the negotiations of the landmine convention: the 
              practice of holding on to certain types or numbers of weapon systems 
              by such </font>countries as the United States, Russia, China and 
              India is typical of classical arms control, but to the majority 
              of countries who became party to the convention, this was unacceptable. 
              ‘Like-minded states’ successfully negotiated the landmine treaty 
              in a new forum, labeled the ‘Ottawa process’. Civil society organizations—NGOs— 
              became a new actor in arms control. The new combination of ‘like-minded’ 
              governments and a diversified network of nationally or internationally 
              operating NGOs who made this treaty possible is the only guarantee 
              for compliance.</p>
            <p>There is no reason to be overenthusiastic. Many states—mine producers 
              as well as mine users, from the United States to Yugoslavia, from 
              Russia to Pakistan, from China to Burma—are not party to the convention. 
              Even states who <i>are </i>party to the convention have continued 
              to plant anti-personnel mines. Non-compliance is not punished. Certain 
              types of mines which are dangerous to people are not prohibited. 
              Moreover, additional research and development has been stimulated 
              by the landmine treaty in order to circumvent its provisions. Whether 
              similar treaties are attainable, for example in the area of small 
              arms and light weapons, will be demonstrated by the 2001 UN conference 
              on the ‘Illegal Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its 
              Aspects’. At the beginning of the new millennium, small arms control 
              has enormous scope for improvement. Yet the credibility of both 
              exporting as well as importing countries could be improved if the 
              present political declarations are underpinned by stricter regulations 
              concerning the movements of small arms.</p>
            <p class="bolditalic">BICC findings: disarmament at a turning point? 
            </p>
            <p>Disarmament is easier than arms control. Each government can unilaterally 
              decide to disarm and need not wait for arms control agreements. 
              This is exactly what many states did during the second half of the 
              eighties and particularly during the nineties and is confirmed by 
              BICC’s measure of disarmament and the potential for conversion, 
              the BICC Conversion, Disarmament, Demilitarization and Demobilization 
              (BIC3D) Index. This gives a value of 30 for the world in 1999, indicating 
              that military sectors had shrunk by 30 percent worldwide between 
              the transition phase around the end of the Cold War and 1999.</p>
            <p>Despite this historically unique reduction in arms, military forces 
              are still enormous. Global military expenditures are estimated to 
              have amounted to US $686 billion in 1999 (in prices of 1993); the 
              present stock of major conventional weapons is still over 422,000 
              pieces; 21.7 million military troops still serve in the world’s 
              armed forces; and almost 8 million employees work in the arms industry. 
              Thus, almost 30 million people still earn their living directly 
              and fully in the military sector.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, high-risk strategies in the field of weapons of mass 
              destruction are still applied.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Military expenditures—Growing again:</span><b> 
              </b>After several years of decline, global military expenditures 
              were on the rise again in 1999. This new development reverses a 
              trend that has seen a drastic reduction in military expenditures 
              and clearly signals a halt, or even a reversal, of disarmament and 
              conversion. Although the majority of countries are still continuing 
              to reduce their military expenditures, some of the bigger spenders 
              such as the United States, France, Germany, China, Russia, Brazil 
              and Australia increased or announced the growth of their expenditures 
              in 1999/2000.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Military research and development— Anti-cyclical 
              trends:</span><b> </b>Global expenditures on military research and 
              development were not as strongly affected by the sharp decreases 
              in the early nineties as other parts of the budget. While military 
              R&amp;D expenditures in Russia were reduced dramatically, those 
              in Western market economies only shrank slightly. During the period 
              of reduced defense production in the nineties, the development of 
              new weapon technologies and weapon systems was prioritized to preserve 
              technological capabilities. R&amp;D seems to have done the job of 
              bridging a period of reduced procurement. With the reversal in military 
              expenditures described above, R&amp;D efforts are slowing down. 
              This could, in turn, mean new demand for conversion at military 
              labs.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Industry restructuring and conversion— Continued 
              internationalization at a higher level of production: </span>After 
              the rapid worldwide decrease in military production, there is now 
              indication that the decrease has not only slowed down and stopped 
              in recent years but might have already been reversed. At least in 
              some of the major arms-producing countries, such as the United States, 
              France, the United Kingdom, Russia and Japan, production has increased 
              again. Unlike production, however, employment in the arms industry 
              has continued to decrease. After a number of mega-mergers in previous 
              years, particularly among the large arms companies in the United 
              States, attention has now turned to international cooperation agreements 
              and acquisitions. However, in the military sector, this process 
              of globalization is much less advanced than in many other industrial 
              sectors. While conversion and diversification of defense production 
              continues in smaller companies without much public attention, larger 
              companies tend to concentrate on their core defense business activities.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Demobilization and reintegration— The need for 
              cooperation with other programs:</span><b> </b>The number of soldiers 
              world-wide has continued to decline for the tenth year running, 
              although the process has also slowed down. From the peak of 28.8 
              million in 1987, it was down to 21.7 million in 1999. While some 
              countries (Russia, Germany) have plans for further cuts in their 
              armed forces, demobilization programs are still ongoing in others, 
              particularly as a result of post-war rationalization (as in Cambodia, 
              East Timor and Sierra Leone). Similar programs will be required 
              if peace agreements are reached in other countries. Most post-war 
              demobilization programs are conducted simultaneously with, or as 
              an integral part of, a more general reform of the security sector 
              which includes the democratic control of the armed forces. In recent 
              years, actors in development cooperation have recognized the fact 
              that they can no longer exclude security issues, but must address 
              them as part of a strategy for sustainable development.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Base closure and redevelopment— Long-term redevelopment 
              tasks still ahead:</span><b> </b>The restructuring processes of 
              armed forces worldwide have greatly reduced the number of military 
              bases. This has been heavily concentrated on Europe as well as on 
              a limited number of countries elsewhere (Australia, Panama, the 
              Philippines, South Africa, the United States and Vietnam). A large 
              array of bases freed by the military still need to be redeveloped, 
              and new civil economic usage needs to be identified. Furthermore, 
              it can be expected that additional rounds of force restructuring, 
              rationalization or demilitarization processes will create new tasks 
              for base redevelopment (for example in Germany, Northern Ireland, 
              Russia, South Africa and the United States).</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Surplus weapons—Political declarations have 
              to be followed by action now:</span><b> </b>The slowing pace of 
              nuclear disarmament has increased the risk of proliferation of all 
              weapons of mass destruction. While the global market for new conventional 
              arms shrank after the political changes of 1989/90, the arms industry 
              has been sustained by an expanded market for the upgrading of used 
              weapons. From 1990 onwards, the total number of armored vehicles, 
              warships, missiles and military aircraft held by all states in the 
              world fell continuously. By 1999, it was almost 30 percent lower. 
              New initiatives to lessen the impact of contemporary wars, such 
              as the campaigns against landmines and small arms, have had some 
              success in their own terms. The issue has become high on the international 
              policy agenda. Partly in response to the growing pressure from civil 
              society, governments are increasingly addressing the threats to 
              human security posed by small arms, but, in practice, political 
              declarations have not yet been fully implemented. </p>
