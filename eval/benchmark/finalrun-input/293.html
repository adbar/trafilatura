			    <P>Subject: Never Forget 

			    <P>Some things the US citizens should never forget: 

			    <P>After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and injured 1,000; President Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 

			    <P>After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 

			    <P>After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 and injured 200 U.S. military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 

			    <P>After the 1998 bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 

			    <P>After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 U.S. sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished. 

			    <P>Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 7,000 people in New York and Washington, D.C. that are now dead would be alive today.

	    <P>Later versions of this chain offered more bad news about Bill and Hilary and attributed the note to "a Navy man."

			    <P>AN INTERESTING QUESTION:
			    <P>This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in show. Without casting stones, it is a legitimate question.

			    <P>There are two men, both extremely wealthy. One develops relatively cheap software and gives billions of dollars to charity. The other sponsors terrorism.

			    <P>That being the case, why was it that the Clinton Administration spent more money chasing down Bill Gates over the past eight years than Osama bin Laden?

			    <P>THINK ABOUT IT!
			    <BR>It is a strange turn of events.
  

			    <P>Hillary gets $8 Million for her forthcoming memoir. Bill gets about $12 Million for his memoir yet to be written.

			    <P>This from two people who have spent the past 8 years being unable to recall anything about past events while under oath!

			 <P>A 2004 Presidential Election Year version of this chain changes the message from one of pure Clinton-bashing, to Bush-backing by adding the line "BUSH COVERED IT" after each of Clinton's alleged failures. It also updates the number of dead from 9/11 and adds a web site address, trying to legitimize the McWhorter attribution:

			    <P>Subj: Bill and Hillary

			    <P>You know, it is easy to forget the 'promises' that Bill and Hillary made while in office. It strikes home when it is listed like this: 

			    <P>After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, which killed six and injured1,000; President Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
			    <BR>BUSH COVERED IT!

			    <P>After the 1995 bombing in Saudi Arabia, which killed five US military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
			    <BR>BUSH COVERED IT!

			    <P>After the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, which Killed 19 and injured 200 US military personnel; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
			    <BR>BUSH COVERED IT!

			    <P>After the 1998 bombing of US embassies in Africa, which killed 224 and injured 5,000; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
			    <BR>BUSH COVERED IT!

			    <P>After the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole, which killed 17 and injured 39 US sailors; Clinton promised that those responsible would be hunted down and punished.
			    <BR>BUSH COVERED IT!

			    <P>Maybe if Clinton had kept his promise, an estimated 3,016 people in New York and Washington, DC that are now dead would be alive today.

			    <P>BUSH TOLD THOSE FIREMAN -- THEY WOULD HEAR US TOO!
And, now that Bush is taking action to bring these people to justice, we have opponents charging him with being a war monger...

			    <P>AN INTERESTING QUESTION:
			    <P>This question was raised on a Philly radio call-in show. Without casting stones, it is a legitimate question.
			    <P>There are two men, both extremely wealthy. One develops relatively cheap software and gives billions of dollars to charity. The other sponsors terrorism.
			    <P>That being the case, why was it that the Clinton Administration spent more money chasing down Bill Gates over the past eight years than Osama bin Laden?

	    <P>We know that Commander McWhorter did not originate this chain, as his name was added more than a year after the first copies of it surfaced. It's possible that he wrote all or part of the added arguments, but it's just as likely that this is another case of <A HREF="/fas.html">False Attribution Syndrome</A>, in which he became associated with it merely because he forwarded it and inadvertently added his identity to it.

	    <P>This chain intimates that after several significant terrorist attacks, President Bill Clinton promised justice would be done, but failed to deliver on those promises. The conclusion is drawn that, had Clinton been tougher on terrorists, the attacks of September 11, 2001, never would have happened. Post 9/11 investigations into intelligence breakdowns have indicated that both the Clinton and Bush administrations are guilty of ignoring warning signs of this tragedy and opportunities to stop it.

	    The September 11 attacks were the result of many years of planning by various individuals and groups with an ages-old agenda to fulfill. Terrorism has been around for centuries and has survived decades upon decades of being "hunted down and punished." The mindsets of those who committed these crimes is deep-seeded in history. It's unlikely that they were significantly encouraged by one man's failure to retaliate. This chain letter's simplification of the attacks to a case of "bad parenting" practically excuses extremist terrorists as spoiled children whose misbehavior was not adequately corrected by a lax father.

	    <P>As a nation searches for justice for the most heinous act of cowardice ever committed on citizens, we are eager to pin the blame on anyone. But blaming the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks on Clinton is an insult to those innocent people who died - reducing their tragic deaths to just one more example of how inept Clinton was. What possible purpose does this chain serve except to deflect attention, hatred and blame from the real monsters behind this tragedy? And now, someone is using it to stump for Bush in an election year? Please, Break this chain!
