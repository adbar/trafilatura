        called the &quot;Toy Train&quot;. The Toy Train ride is a romantic approach to the
        Himalayas, a mysterious region. The landscape can only be described as spectacular and the
        views of the Himalayan peaks breathtaking. The Darjeeling Toy Train is one of the most
        famous narrow (2 feet ) gauge trains. </strong></font></p>

            the plains. The plains are much more warmer than the hills and as the train climbs up the
            mountains the climate gets much colder. Therefore it is advisable to keep warm clothes
            handy as one needs them. Leaving New Jalpaiguri station the train passes through the
            outskirts of Siliguri town and reaches Siliguri station. After a short halt the train
            leaves Siliguri station and crosses the Mahanadi bridge over the Mahanadi river which
            flows from the Himalayan foothills. </strong></p>

            Nepali. From here the blue mountain ranges of the foothills are visible and the train

        really beautiful. The train moves on with the view of tea gardens, tea factories and
        forests. It then passes Chunbhati. Before the railway line was built, there was a bungalow
        here where the travellers travelling in palki (palanquin) used to rest for the day. The
        train is now fairly among the mountains and a panoramic view of the deep valley and higher
        range of mountains is visible. Then the train passes the Tindharia Railway workshop to
        reach Tindharia station (2,822 feet/860m).</strong></p>

            the train later has to pass through. Using &quot;zig-zag reverses&quot; the train leaves

        <p align="justify"><strong>After this station the train stops for water near Pagla Jhora (Mad Torrent).
        During the monsoon this small stream swells up and is big enough to wash away the road and
        railway line. Shortly after this the train reaches Mahanadi Bazar station (4,000
        ft/1,225m). Just near this town is the source of the Mahanadi river which the train had
        earlier crossed shortly after leaving Siliguri. Leaving Mahanadi the train travels west
        through Gidhapahar (Eagle's Craig) with an excellent view of the valley, the hills and tea
        gardens and reaches Kurseong station (4,864 feet/1485m). </strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Kurseong is a thriving little hill station. Here one can get the first glimpse
        of a hill town and the hill people. Leaving Kurseong the train passes through Kurseong
        bazar and goes on in its journey. The sight of Tibetan prayer flags as the train passes
        over Hussel (whistle) khola (stream) makes the traveller feel that he is now truly in the
        mountains. The train passes through small forests of maple, chestnut, pear, cherry,
        criptomeria (introduced from Japan), etc. and cardamom plants.</strong></p>

            excellent view of the Kurseong ridge. As the train passes along the road, one may notice
            by now that through the journey from New Jalpaiguri to Darjeeling there are over 100 road
            crossings and most of the time the train runs along parallel with the cars and other
            vehicles. </strong></p>

        train passes through Senchel Reserve forest with oaks, chestnuts, walnuts, magnolias,
        rhododendrons, etc. During spring one can see the bright blooms of rhododendrons, cream
        magnolias and orchids in this moss-laden forest. On top of this hill is a famous tourist
        spot Tiger Hill with a unique view of the Himalayas and also of the sunrise. This forest
        region is well known worldwide for bird-watching.</strong></p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>The train now passes through a small town called Jorebunglow. The road here is
        very narrow and often there are traffic jams since all the traffic in and out of
        Darjeeling pass this point. This must be the only place where the train may have to stop
        for a while in case of a traffic jam or have to back up a bit to ease the traffic. The
        train now reaches Ghoom (7407 ft/2260 m) the highest point of the journey. </strong></p>

            other snowy mountains in the back-drop. From now onwards uptill Darjeeling, the snowy
