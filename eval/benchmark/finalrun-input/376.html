<P><FONT SIZE="+3" FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">M</FONT><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">any 
  years ago I was ordained a Zen monk. Entering the small monastery in rural Japan, 
  where I still live, provided the form and direction to the spiritual quest which 
  had been developing since my youth. In 1986, ten years after having entered 
  the monastery, I first came in contact with the Alexander Technique and immediately 
  noticed parallels between it and Zen. Since then I have often reflected on those 
  similarities and in the context of spirituality and Alexander discoveries, I 
  would like to share a few of my observations.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Spirituality has been an 
  important component in the lives of men and women since the dawn of human history. 
  Religion did not arise simply because people wanted to appease powerful forces. 
  It helped them relate to their environment and ground themselves in it. Primarily, 
  though, religion has been the means to explain the tragedy and suffering of 
  this beautiful, yet terrifying world. Through the thousands and thousands of 
  years of human existence, spirituality has constantly changed and adapted. Religion 
  has shown itself to be very pragmatic. When one idea of God or gods ceases to 
  work, it is discarded in favour of another. Although the West in the twentieth 
  century is often characterised by its secular belief in humanism, there is now 
  growing interest in the nontheistic religions of the East, particularly Buddhism. 
  Perhaps the two main reasons for this are the teaching that everything is one 
  unity, together with the living tradition of practising under a teacher and 
  personally experiencing this for oneself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">In my own case, I was drawn 
  to Zen because of a deep question about how a person ought to live. How, I wondered, 
  could one person possibly bring about any change in the immense problems which 
  face the world: war, poverty, various forms of discrimination, the destruction 
  of the environment and so on. Like many who came of age in the 1960's, I was 
  seeking an alternative to the materialistic lifestyle which we perceived to 
  be the main cause of these problems. However, in the course of seeking, reflecting, 
  and asking what could be done to resolve these problems, I realised that in 
  order to change the world I had to change myself. I saw that the root cause 
  of all suffering is the greed, anger, and folly arising from the ego-self. Zen 
  seemed the most direct and down-to-earth practice to achieve freedom from an 
  egocentric viewpoint. Once that liberation is realised it would then be possible 
  to 'return to the marketplace' to aid in imparting that peace and freedom to 
  others. To die and be reborn in this manner is certainly no easy task, and many 
  years have passed since I began this journey. Yet I am still very much dedicated 
  to this way of liberation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">The Alexander work came 
  into my life at a time when I was having much difficulty with pain in my lower 
  back. In fact it seemed that if the condition did not improve I would have to 
  quit sitting through the long retreats of intensive zazen which we have several 
  times a year in the monastery where I live. Very fortunately the person who 
  was to become my main Alexander teacher came to live with us at the monastery. 
  Largely through her great generosity, patience and dedication I was able to 
  overcome my back problem. This is no small feat as I am a tall (196cm), thin 
  (70kg) man with a scoliosis of the spine, living in an environment constructed 
  for people who are much, much shorter. In more ways than one, my health has 
  been seriously affected by the strain of misusing my body. Now, though, in large 
  part thanks to the Alexander work, I am in good health.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">It would be fun simply 
  to write about the challenges I have faced living in the monastery: short handles 
  on everything from brooms to shovels, low sinks, extremely low thresholds, long 
  periods of sitting and standing still and so on. However, as I must be as brief 
  as possible, I will confine myself to the topic of spirituality&emdash;specifically 
  Zen&emdash;and the Alexander Technique, a subject which could easily fill a 
  book.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">There is a deep religious 
  aspect to the Alexander work which is perhaps often overlooked, namely trust 
  or belief. Alexander is praised for the highly scientific approach he took&emdash;both 
  in the way he found, and applied, his discovery. However, there is not as great 
  a gap between science and religion as we tend to think.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Science demands 
  the fundamental belief that there is a rational explanation for everything, 
  it also requires an imagination and courage which are not dissimilar to religious 
  creativity &#133; A truly creative philosopher or scientist, has like the mystic 
  to confront the dark world of uncreated reality and the cloud of unknowing in 
  the hope of piercing it.</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">1</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>

  of all true religiousness.</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">2</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Alexander clearly documented 
  the critical point in his study that would enable him to pass from the 'known 
  to the unknown.'</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">I now saw that 
  if I was ever to succeed in making the changes in use I desired, I must subject 
  the processes directing my use to a new experience, that is of being dominated 
  by reasoning instead of feeling. This meant that I must be prepared to carry 
  on with any procedure I had reasoned out as best for my purpose, even though 
  that procedure might feel wrong. In other words, my trust in my reasoning process 
  to bring me safely to my 'end' must be a genuine trust, not a half-trust needing 
  the assurance of feeling right as well.</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">3</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">From the point of view 
  of Zen, there are two interesting points in all of this (I should say that while 
  Zen is a religion, it is also a rigorous study of reality and, more specifically, 
  the self). First of all, the idea that science can rationally explain everything 
  is a belief. It is a belief that modern man has nearly substituted for the belief 
  in God. Yet explanation, no matter how precise, can never be the reality itself. 
  Say the word 'fire,' for example. Why doesn't it burn your mouth? Say the word 
  'water.' Why doesn't it quench your thirst? In these simple examples, we can 
  see that descriptions, whether they be words, picture images or thoughts, are 
  not the thing itself. Consequently, it is one of the axioms, not only of Zen 
  but of other mystic traditions as well, that reality itself is fundamentally 
  unknowable. In this way it is possible to use reason to see the limits of the 
  intellect and to understand that it must be transcended, but to become reality 
  itself requires great belief.</FONT></P>

  <HR>
  <p></P>
</CENTER>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">The second important point 
  in this connection is that faith or trust implies doubt. No one believes that 
  the sky is blue, that water is wet, or that salt is salty. These truths are 
  self-evident. For Alexander the question at the centre of his doubt was: 'What 
  am I doing to myself to cause my difficulties?' This doubt was an essential 
  factor, in combination with his faith in reasoning, in fostering the determination 
  necessary to find a resolution to his problem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">In Zen there is a similar 
  process. Without genuine belief in the Buddhist teaching that all beings are 
  essentially in a state of liberation as-they-are, we will always look outside 
  the present moment. It is precisely the doubt that we personally have not realised 
  this liberation, together with the faith that we already are liberated, which 
  will motivate us to actually make it our own. What is amazing is that Alexander 
  accomplished this without a teacher, but then so did Shakyamuni Buddha. For 
  those of us following in their footsteps, it makes it that much easier. Yet 
  it is necessary that we also do what they did. As Alexander put it so succinctly&emdash;if 
  you will do what I did, you will be able to do what I do. If we can truly do 
  what they did, it becomes our own, at which point reason and faith are no longer 
  necessary. What is the practice required for making their realisations our own? 
  There are some intriguing parallels.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Zen is the direct realisation 
  of the oneness of all things. In a word, it is to forget the ego-self which 
  is the source of all such distinctions as right and wrong, likes and dislikes, 
  you and me, life and death. There is a well known Zen story of a monk named 
  Joshu who asked his master, "What is the Way?" He wanted to know the means by 
  which he could attain true peace and freedom. His master said, "Everyday mind 
  is the Way." Each activity in our life, from morning till evening, is the Way 
  itself. Joshu was not satisfied though. He was not interested in mere intellectual 
  understanding. So he asked again, "What sort of practice can I do in order to 
  truly realise that everyday mind is the Way?" The master replied, "If you look 
  for it, you'll only go in the wrong direction." Practice with the intention 
  of trying to understand 'everyday mind' will only separate you from it further. 
  Joshu was getting more and more confused and somewhat desperately asked, "But 
  if I don't do anything, how can I ever understand the Way?!" His master said, 
  "The Way is neither knowing nor not knowing. Knowing is delusion, not knowing 
  is indifference. When you have reached the true Way beyond doubt, you will find 
  it as vast and boundless as outer space. How can it be talked about on the level 
  of right and wrong?" With these words, Joshu attained sudden realisation. The 
  important point of this story is that true liberation is neither in intellectual 
  understanding nor in shrugging it off indifferently.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Human beings can only think 
  of the past and the future. Once something is perceived it is already past. 
  For this reason, the moment 'now' is unknowable. It is beyond knowing and not 
  knowing. It is beyond right and wrong, profit and loss, enlightenment and delusion, 
  life and death. In a word, it is the timeless, eternal reality which mystics 
  and scientists struggle to apprehend. Yet since it is unthinkable (the Unthinkable), 
  it precedes consciousness and so it is also of course beyond apprehension.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Many people assume that 
  if all evil could somehow be eradicated only good would remain. But this is 
  impossible. Good and evil can only exist in opposition to each other. This has 
  great significance for the Alexander work. Alexander clearly saw the problem 
  arising from knowing. "You can't do what you don't know, if you keep doing what 
  you do know."5 If we can simply give up the desire to be right, then, wrong 
  immediately disappears and we are left with the present moment which is empty 
  of either one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">No one can think two thoughts 
  at the same time. It simply is not possible to think of being right and being 
  wrong at the same time. One thought must disappear before another can arise. 
  This one thought is the unknowable 'now.' By perceiving 'me', the ego consciousness 
  divides one thing into two: past and future, you and me, right and wrong. We 
  are constantly choosing between what we like and what we do not. Yet these are 
  merely ideas, they do not actually exist.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">'Endgaining' is the term 
  Alexander gave to the unconscious tendency for people to become fixated on the 
  result of a process, rather than paying attention to the means by which it is 
  attained. It was his genius to describe how the habit of wanting to do what 
  feels right comes from our deep-seated fear of being wrong and making mistakes. 
  In Zen, we have a remarkably similar term, 'seeking mind.' This is a condition 
  of constantly seeking outside the present moment. We are exceedingly insecure, 
  for example, if we do not know. Continually we want more information and more 
  experience to prove that we do know. The problem is that one answer is simply 
  the seed for the next question&emdash;a never ending cycle of illusion. In Zen 
  we say "take a step off a 100 foot pole." To truly awaken to the nature of reality 
  it is necessary to let go of what we know and what we do not know. A great leap 
  of faith is required to take us from the 'known to the unknown.'</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">A corollary to this is 
  Alexander's discovery that he only had to think of reciting and it would affect 
  the physical use of his body. He was one of the first Westerners, at least in 
  the modern age, to realise that mind and body are one. This is a teaching, though, 
  which has existed in Buddhism for 2500 years. In Zen we are taught to see with 
  the whole body, likewise to hear - smell - taste - feel and think with the whole 
  body. We are assured that if we practice this way single-mindedly we will attain 
  satori, liberation from the illusion of self.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">The six sense functions 
  (including thinking) work automatically. No one has ever had to train themselves 
  in order to see or hear or smell. Moreover, there is no central organising function 
  (self) within us which controls us. For example, if the eyes are open, there 
  is nothing inside of us which can give the order not to see. If the eyes are 
  open, there is seeing. Even if we have never seen a certain object before, we 
  can recognise it instantly. Likewise with the ears. No matter how many sounds 
  we might hear at one time, they do not get jumbled up into one noise. There 
  is nothing more mysterious than the powers of these sense functions. We do not 
  even really know what thought is or where it is located.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">This brings us back to 
  the fact that we can only think one thought at a time. One thought must disappear 
  before another can arise. This includes the thought of 'me.' To think "I am 
  seeing such and such" is, in fact, two thoughts. Consequently the significance 
  of mind and body being one unity is that when there is seeing, it isn't me who 
  sees, but rather that there is only seeing, no seer and nothing seen. When there 
  is thinking, there is only thought, no thinker and nothing thought of. This 
  is our reality now, moment to moment. It means that we are always one with our 
  environment.</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Human beings are 
  aware that something is wrong with their condition; they feel at odds with themselves 
  and others, out of touch with their inner nature and disoriented. Conflict and 
  a lack of sympathy seem to characterise our existence. Yet we are constantly 
  seeking to unite the multiplicity of phenomena and reduce them to some ordered 
  whole. </FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">4

<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">If only we could realise

<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Astronomers estimate that 
  the Milky Way with its hundreds of billions of stars is revolving at the speed 
  of 500,000 miles per hour around its centre. At the molecular level, biologists 
  tells us that 98% of the atoms in the human body are replaced in less than one 
  year and that within the span of four years every single atom of the human body 
  is replaced at least once. Yet no one is conscious of these facts in their everyday 
  life. In the same way no one is aware of the extremely high rate of speed at 
  which thought arises. In the Buddhist teaching, there are said to be thousands 
  of changes per second, a constant flux of change. While it is not possible to 
  change that reality, it is possible to stop interfering with it by trying to 
  use it for our own illusory advantage. This brings us to the correlation between 
  the 'non-doing' of inhibition and zazen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Central to the teaching 
  of Buddhism is the law of cause and effect. Past causes have created the present 
  result. The present result will be the cause of future results. My Zen master 
  always says that if we want to know our condition five, ten or even twenty years 
  from now, all we have to do is look at our condition now. Each time we put off 
  something we know we ought to do, we create the stimulus for putting it off 
  again. Conversely, each time we withhold consent to react in a habitual manner, 
  we break a link in the chain which binds us.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">In other words, if you 
  want to change your life, you must do it now. Essentially the greatest change 
  we can make is to give up seeking results elsewhere and simply accept our reality 
  as it is now. Zazen is the practice of abandoning ourselves to the present moment. 
  If we can let go of our opinions and ideas in the form of expectations, intentions, 
  and desire for meaning, we can see that each moment is exactly what we are seeking, 
  even if we are anxious or confused. This also includes, of course, reflecting 
  on the past and planning for the future, yet with the detachment of knowing 
  that there is never anything other than the moment 'now.'</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Alexander discovered in 
  the course of seeking for a solution to his vocal problem that it was necessary 
  at the critical moment to inhibit his habitual response of 'doing' what felt 
  right. This was the first step. Others have since called this 'letting yourself 
  be.' By stopping the unconscious tendency to depend on his habitual feelings 
  of rightness, he could go on to the second step. This was to give a series of 
  reasoned-out guiding orders. In this way he was able to achieve his end not 
  by doing it, but by allowing it to happen. He had realised that mind and body 
  are one. By resisting the impulse to 'do' and then projecting through thought 
  the appropriate directions, he was able to give himself a new experience. Later 
  he always emphasised that by withholding consent to do what feels right, the 
  ends would come of themselves.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">In Zen, the Buddhist teaching 
  serves the purpose of guiding orders or directions. In fact we refer to the 
  teaching as 'a finger pointing at the moon.' The 'moon' is liberation, awakening 
  to the true nature of the self. The teachings of impermanence, no-self, and 
  the timeless, tranquil nature of the unknowable moment 'now', all point to the 
  necessity of forgetting the ego-self. The precepts and the Bodhisattva vows, 
  on one hand, and the practice of zazen on the other, provide the means whereby 
  to attain it. In any case, it is the moon which is the goal and not the finger. 
  As in the Alexander work, inevitably there is a tendency at the beginning to 
  'do' the practice of directions. However, with time and perseverance, together 
  with a skilful teacher, the habit of 'doing' will give way to 'just being.' 
  This is the ability to devote ourselves completely to each task simply for its 
  own sake. No longer is there finger or moon, for we realise that essentially 
  moon and finger are one. We are then free to work 100% for the sake of all living 
  beings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">It is not my intention 
  to say that Zen and the Alexander Technique are the same. Certainly different 
  people will view them in different ways. Perhaps many will think I am trying 
  to compare two things which are on completely different levels. However, I do 
  think that for some people they can be compatible practices and even be complementary 
  in a beneficial manner. Alexander did speak of religion in a way strikingly 
  similar to Zen when he said:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">The essence of 
  the religious outlook is that religion should not be kept in a compartment by 
  itself, but that it should be the ever present guiding principle of life underlying 
  the "daily round", the "common task". So also it is possible to apply this principle 
  of life in the daily round of one's activities without involving a loss of attention 
  in these activities.</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">5</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">This is the way of 'everyday 
  mind'.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Zen is the practice and 
  realisation of transcending the dualism of self-and-other through attention 
  to all activities in our everyday life. Many people associate Zen with a certain 
  posture of sitting cross-legged, but this is merely a position of 'mechanical 
  advantage.' This would be akin to thinking that the 'monkey position' is the 
  Alexander Technique. In fact, zazen is not meditation. Zazen is zazen. It is 
  both the end as well as the means by which to forget the distinction between 
  self and meditation. In this connection, Alexander was possibly right when he 
  wrote:</FONT></P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">You see, a person 
  cannot capitulate to subconscious guidance to the extent which 'meditation' 
  demands in practice, without seriously affecting the psychophysical self in 
  reaction to living</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">.6</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Zen is to forget the self 
  whether sitting still or in activity. Zen is to breathe with the whole body, 
  to work, laugh, play, and cry with the whole body. Yet to truly make that our 
  own and not simply get stuck in intellectual understanding requires great effort.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">As we approach the end 
  of the twentieth century, the world is undergoing tremendous change. There is 
  a wide array of extremely serious problems facing human life on this planet&emdash;widespread 
  destruction of the environment, overpopulation, AIDS, severe famine and poverty, 
  unprecedented crime and violence. What will be the future role of spirituality? 
  Can the Alexander work provide a spiritual discipline to help us face these 
  problems? Towards the end of his life, Alexander said, "After working for a 
  lifetime in this new field, I am conscious that the knowledge gained is but 
  a beginning." He knew that the "knowledge of the self is fundamental to all 
  other." What new horizons are there for the Alexander work? Can it provide the 
  means whereby people can learn to stop the increasing greed for instant gratification, 
  for our constant desire to know that we are right? Can it truly enhance the 
  knowledge of the self?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">For me it is clear that 
  Alexander put his finger directly on the problem when he said, "You want to 
  feel out whether you are right or not. I am giving you a conception to eradicate 
  that. I don't want you to care a damn if you're right or not. Directly you don't 
  care if you're right or not, the impeding obstacle is gone."</FONT><A HREF="#rummeen"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">7</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">That obstacle is nothing 
  other than the ego-self.</FONT></P>

  please see <I>The Essence of Zen</I> by my master, Sekkei Harada Roshi. This 
  book, recently published by Kodansha International, is a translation I did of 
  a collection of Dharma talks given by him in Europe and the US. The material 
  covered in this book presents the basic teaching of Zen in relatively easy-to-understand 
  terms. Information about his monastery can be found on the web at : </FONT><A HREF="http://www.semui.co.jp/hosshinji"><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">http://www.semui.co.jp/hosshinji</FONT></A></P>

<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">Daigaku Rumme was born 
  in Mason City, Iowa, USA in 1950. His father was sent as a missionary to Japan 
  in 1961 where he lived until he returned to Iowa for college. He graduated in 
  1972, as, he writes: "a properly dis-illusioned young man. I was unable to think 
  of any sort of occupation which seemed mean-ingful, plus I wanted to do something 
  that would change the world, not just be part of the status quo."</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">At that time he came across 
  a copy of Shunryu Suzuki's book Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind and eventually, in 
  1976, decided to enter Hosshinji, a Japanese Zen Monastery. He ordained as a 
  monk two years later, in 1978.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT FACE="verdana,arial,helvetica,courier,geneva">While living in Japan, 
  and in return trips to the States, he he has taken hundreds of Alexander lessons 
  with many different teachers. He continues living at the monastery&emdash;meditating, 
  studying and acting as a translator for his revered spiritual master, Sekkei 
  Harada Roshi.</FONT></P>
