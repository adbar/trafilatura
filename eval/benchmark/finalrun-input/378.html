                    it matter who divorces whom?</font></small></strong></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">There are some disadvantages in 
                    being the one who is divorced. Firstly, you can be ordered 
                    to pay the legal fees for the divorce; this may seem (and 
                    often is) extremely unfair, a case of adding injury to insult. 
                    This is based on the old principle in the courts that if you 
                    prove your case then you get your costs, despite the fact 
                    that it is not always appropriate in the family justice system. 
                    However, if the practicalities of the actual divorce are agreed 
                    by both parties, it is also possible to agree that the two 
                    of you will share the legal fees between you, or indeed that 
                    the person who actually files the petition will not seek an 
                    order for costs against the spouse.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Secondly, you may have the unpleasantness 
                    of being on the receiving end of some legal description of 
                    your private life, especially if the divorce is based on unreasonable 
                    behaviour. It is possible to file an Answer to the allegations 
                    and try to regain control of the process by forcing a compromise 
                    on the allegations made, but most prefer to avoid the legal 
                    complications and significant expense of doing so. Nevertheless, 
                    allegations made as to unreasonable behaviour do often stick 
                    in the gullet as the contents of the Petition rarely have 
                    much to do with why the marriage broke down.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">But who petitions against whom 
                    rarely spills over in to other more important areas, such 
                    as the children or finance. It is worth just checking that 
                    none of the allegations in the Petition relate to dealing 
                    with the children or to financial issues, since once the divorce 
                    is granted, those allegations become a finding of fact. Unless 
                    it is specifically agreed beforehand, these findings can be 
                    referred to in linked proceedings.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The usual way of preventing such 
                    difficulties - and much acrimony too - is to offer the Petition 
                    in draft before it is sent to the court. Any items that cause 
                    particular upset can be discussed and either watered down 
                    or left out. This is not something that everyone has to do, 
                    but is very much in the spirit of the SFLA Code of Practice.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">An early discussion with an SFLA 
                    solicitor can help resolve some of these issues.</font></small></p>

                  <p><i><font face="Courier New" size="2"></font></i><a name="is new law of divorce easier"><small><font face="Arial"><strong>Is 
                    there going to be a new law of divorce?</strong></font></small></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The Family Law Act 1996 was passed 
                    in a fanfare, hailed as going some way towards removing acrimony 
                    in the divorce process by getting rid of the concept of 'fault'. 
                    However, the Government has since announced that those parts 
                    of the Act dealing with divorce will not now come into force.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">We are, unfortunately, left with 
                    the present system for the foreseeable future.</font></small></p>

                    to list of questions</font></small></a></p>
                  <hr>
                  <p><i><font face="Courier New" size="2"></font></i><a name="Which court does it have to be in?"><small><font face="Arial"><strong>Which 
                    court does it have to be in?</strong></font></small></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">If the divorce is going to take 
                    place in England and Wales, it is possible to get any County 
                    Court that is empowered to deal with divorce to issue proceedings.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">It is usual to use your local court 
                    for convenience's sake. Some use a court that is out of their 
                    area for fear of coming into contact with people they know 
                    in the local context (Mrs Simpson used Ipswich!). The Principal 
                    Registry in London is used by many who do not live there, 
                    for a mixture of all of these reasons or perhaps they believe 
                    that that court will handle their case better.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Practices and judicial attitudes 
                    vary from court to court. Experienced solicitors with knowledge 
                    of the system sometimes choose a particular court for a particular 
                    case, to try and gain some advantage for their client.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">But for the vast majority of cases 
                    it is convenience that is the deciding factor - convenience 
                    for the solicitors particularly, since they will charge for 
                    their travel time to court. In any event courts have the power 
                    to order cases to be transferred to the court that is most 
                    appropriate - in the view of the judge rather than anyone 
                    else.</font></small></p>

                    children automatically live with their mother?</strong></font></small></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Married parents share joint parental 
                    responsibility and come before the Court as equals. The children's 
                    welfare is the court's paramount consideration. </font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">If there is a dispute as to with 
                    which parent the children should live, one or other of them 
                    must issue an application for a Residence Order. In considering 
                    which parent is best able to meet the child's best interests, 
                    the Court will apply the &quot;welfare checklist&quot; (s1(3) 
                    Children Act 1989).</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The application of the Welfare 
                    Checklist points towards pragmatism:</font></small>
                  <ul>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">Who is best able to meet the 
                      child's day to day needs? </font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">What has the domestic routine 
                      been in the child's life to date? </font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">Even if there is little to choose 
                      between the two parents in terms of their actual parenting 
                      skills, are the work commitments of one more conducive to 
                      having primary care of the children? This last consideration 
                      is often fundamental and traditionally, has tended to work 
                      in favour of mothers, but increasingly, this need not necessarily 
                      be the case. </font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">Even where one parent does have 
                      a Residence Order in his or her favour, that does not alter 
                      the fact that the other parent retains parental responsibility 
                      and has an important role to play in the child's life. In 
                      theory at least, a Residence Order is not a passport to 
                      making important decisions about the child's upbringing 
                      on a unilateral basis.</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">In the case of unmarried parents, 
                      the mother has sole parental responsibility until the father 
                      acquires it by way of an agreement, or Court Order. He will 
                      however be granted parental responsibility automatically 
                      if he has a Residence Order in his favour.</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">In the case of very young children, it is a fact that 
                      courts tend to assume they are better off living with their 
                      mother unless clearly shown to the contrary. Nevertheless, 
                      there is no presumption of law and the courts have to consider 
                      each case on its individual merits. Although the odds may 
                      seem stacked against a father, the facts may mean that this 
                      is not necessarily the case.</font></small></li>

                  <p><i></i><a name="Is a 50/50 split _ financial settlement?"><small><font face="Arial"><strong>Is 
                    a 50/50 split the usual financial settlement?</strong></font></small></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Recent cases concerning 'big money' 
                    - where the assets available for division clearly exceed the 
                    parties' needs - have focused on the concept of equality of 
                    outcome. This may or may not mean that the assets are divided 
                    50/50 in these cases. What it does mean is that contributions 
                    to the running of the home and the bringing up of children 
                    are valued equally by the court on divorce to contributions 
                    made by economically rewarding work. There may be other considerations 
                    - for example, the liquidity of the assets making up the family 
                    pot, or any inheritances received, or particularly bad financial 
                    conduct on one side, which dictate that the outcome should 
                    not be equal. Fairness is the key - and a 50/50 split will 
                    not be fair in all cases. <br>
                    <br>
                    Each case has to be looked at individually. It depends on 
                    the circumstances of those involved. </font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">In most cases, the financial settlement 
                    will reflect what each person needs fundamentally, money to 
                    pay all the bills and to sort out somewhere to live.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Having an equal split is sometimes 
                    the starting point, but a lot of other factors have to be 
                    taken into account.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">See the section on <a href="../finance/introduction.htm">FINANCE</a> 
                    for more details. This explains how the law works.</font></small></p>

                  <p><small><font face="Arial">You need to check the way in which 
                    your home is owned. Is it in your sole name? If it is, it 
                    will pass under the terms of your will or intestacy.<br>
                    <br>
                    There are two ways of owning a home jointly - as equitable 
                    joint tenants, or as tenants-in-common.<br>
                    <br>
                    Many couples own their home as joint tenants, which means 
                    in such a way that if one of them dies, the other owns the 
                    property outright automatically.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">This arrangement may still be the 
                    right one after separation - at least for the time being.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">It is possible though to change 
                    the way in which you own any property jointly - so that if 
                    one of you dies then his or her share passes to their estate 
                    and is then dealt with under their will i.e. to set up a tenancy-in-common. 
                    This is called severing the joint tenancy by giving a formal 
                    Notice of Severance to the other joint owner.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Your solicitor can prepare this 
                    for you. You should always take advice on this point because 
                    it may lead to claims against your estate if you die.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">It may be helpful to prepare a 
                    new will early on - even if this is only a temporary measure.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The decree absolute of divorce 
                    automatically alters your will in so far as it relates to 
                    the other spouse. It is important to consider changing your 
                    will at that stage in any event.</font></small></p>

                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The exception to this is where 
                    the parent who died had a <u>Residence Order</u> in his or

                    then an application for a <u>Residence Order</u> needs to 
                    be made to the Court who will then determine with whom the

                    I change my child&#146;s surname?</strong></font></small></a></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Neither parent, nor indeed any 
                    other person, can change a child&#146;s surname without the 
                    written consent of every person with parental responsibility 
                    or the leave of the Court. Even in cases where the parents 
                    are unmarried, the Court has suggested that such a step should 
                    generally not be taken without either the other parent's agreement 
                    or a court decision. Changing a child&#146;s surname is obviously 
                    a very emotive step, since the surname may provide an important 
                    link to the parent with whom the child does not normally live; 
                    it may also express a preference to be known as the child 
                    of the step-parent.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The Court will not consider it 
                    appropriate to change a child&#146;s surname just because 
                    it is different to that of their half&#150;or&#150;step-siblings, 
                    nor even simply because the child wants it changed. The Court 
                    will not sanction a change in surname lightly; there is a 
                    presumption in favour of the status quo.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Increasingly, children may be part 
                    of a step-family in which children do not all share the same 
                    surname. It is therefore important that any such proposal 
                    is very carefully thought through and justifiable on quite 
                    strict grounds, such as where there is no ongoing relationship 
                    whatsoever with the other biological parent and so to retain 
                    that name causes distress and confusion.</font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">The uppermost consideration for 
                    the Court in considering whether a change of surname is appropriate 
                    is the child&#146;s welfare and best interests. It is everything 
                    to do with the rights of the child and nothing to do with 
                    any asserted parental rights. How those best interests are 
                    met will depend upon balancing a range of factors including:</font></small>
                  <ul>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">the original surname with which 
                      the child was registered and whether all the circumstances 
                      justify such a change (ie. is there a good enough reason?);</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">whether the change of name has 
                      already happened and how long ago;</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">the age of the child involved 
                      and whether he or she is deemed competent to understand 
                      the complexity of issues arising;</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">the need to preserve a link 
                      between the child and the non-residential parent, regardless 
                      of contact arrangements;</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">whether the reaction of either 
                      parent to the decision and any consequences would cause 
                      practical detriment to the child;</font></small></li>
                    <li><small><font face="Arial">the strength of the child's 
                      connection with the current surname.</font></small></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">In certain instances the Court 
                    has made a distinction between a child&#146;s &quot;official&quot; 
                    name and the name by which the child chooses to be known; 
                    this to be particularly relevant with an older child, although 
                    the parents themselves would be obliged not to cause them 
                    to be known by anything other than the official name. However, 
                    in another case involving teenage children the Court decided 
                    that the father&#146;s surname should be kept in the face 
                    of opposition from the children and in circumstances where 
                    no contact was taking place in order to underline the importance 
                    of the paternal link. </font></small></p>
                  <p><small><font face="Arial">Inevitably, the issue continues 
                    to be a difficult and highly emotionally-charged one to resolve, 
                    but one in which the Court considers it important enough to 
                    be involved where the parents cannot agree.</font></small></p>

                    <li><font face="Arial"><small>Don't talk to your solicitor 
                      about emotional problems - there are better qualified people 
                      to help with those who cost less. Solicitors will be sympathetic
