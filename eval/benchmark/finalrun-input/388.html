<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="">Last Updated: May 16, 2003</FONT> 
 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">Synonyms and related keywords</FONT>: acute mountain sickness, AMS, mal de montagne, soroche, high-altitude cerebral edema, HACE  
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">Pathophysiology</FONT>:<BR>
Rapid ascent to high altitude overtaxes the body's ability to tolerate the decreasing availability of oxygen. The cerebral forms of altitude illness appear to be due to hypoxia-induced changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, which results in a vasogenic brain edema.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">Mortality/Morbidity</FONT>:<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">
AMS is a self-limiting disease and generally resolves in 1-5 days</FONT>.
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">HACE may be fatal within 1-2 days</FONT> unless treated by immediate descent. Recovery is usually complete, although in very rare cases, patients with either severe or prolonged HACE may have persistent neurological deficits. A small percentage of very ill patients may die even with proper treatment (i.e., descent, oxygen, steroids).
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">History</FONT>: <BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">AMS and HACE occur in the context of</FONT> a recent ascent to altitudes higher than about 2500 m (8,200 ft). Additionally, patients often have a history of rapid ascent, with sleeping elevations increased by more than 300 m (1,000 ft) per night above 3000 m (9,800 ft). Patients frequently lack the spontaneous diuresis normally seen at altitude.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006666">
Normal effects of exposure to altitude</FONT> include the following:<BR>
Exertional dyspnea<BR>
Spontaneous diuresis<BR>
Nocturnal periodic breathing (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes respirations)<BR>
Frequent awakening at night<BR>
Weird or vivid dreams<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#990000">
In the context of a recent ascent</FONT>, the diagnosis of AMS is implied by headache plus at least 1 of the following symptoms:<BR>
Gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., anorexia, nausea, vomiting)<BR>
Light-headedness or dizziness<BR>
Weakness or fatigue<BR>
Insomnia<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">
Diagnosis of HACE is</FONT> implied by the following criteria:<BR>
Ascent with symptoms of AMS is the most common history.<BR>
HACE may evolve after a very rapid ascent despite the absence of AMS. In this context "rapid ascent" means significantly more than the recommended 300 meters (1,000 ft) per day; the actual ascent rate in meters per hour probably is not important.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">HACE commonly occurs after</FONT> the onset of severe high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), probably due to severe hypoxemia.
Confusion, lassitude, and other mental status changes implied by patient's history could indicate HACE.<BR>
History of gait ataxia may be a sign of HACE.<BR>
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">Physical</FONT>:<BR> 
<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#993300">Acute mountain sickness (AMS)</FONT><BR>
Patients appear ill but otherwise have no characteristic physical findings.
Neurologic examination results (especially mental status and gait) are normal.
Cardiac rate does not correlate with acclimatization or AMS.<BR>
Pulmonary crackles may be present in some patients.<BR>
Fever is absent.<BR>
High-altitude cerebral edema<BR>
Suspect the diagnosis in a patient with symptoms of AMS who develops gait ataxia (i.e., unable to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line) or mental status changes.<BR>
Regardless of AMS symptoms, a combination of ataxia and mental status changes suggests HACE.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">... In rare cases, focal neurologic signs</FONT> (i.e., cranial nerve III palsy, cranial nerve VI palsy) appear in end-stage HACE, although they are more suggestive of other causes of focal deficits at altitude (e.g., stroke, transient ischemic attack [TIA], migraine, brain neoplasm).

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#000099">Altitude Illness - Pulmonary Syndromes</FONT><BR>
Last Updated: May 16, 2003  
 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">Synonyms and related keywords</FONT>: high-altitude pulmonary edema, HAPE, high-altitude cough, high-altitude bronchitis, high-altitude cerebral edema, HACE  

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#990033">Pathophysiology</FONT>:<BR>
HAPE is a noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. <BR>
... the disease is thought to be caused by patchy hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (likely due to local shunting response to hypoxia) with consequent localized overperfusion combined with hypoxic permeability of pulmonary capillary walls. These changes result in high pulmonary artery pressure, high permeability, and leak into the alveoli. HAPE is quite distinct from other forms of pulmonary edema and adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">Mortality/Morbidity</FONT>:<BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">
HAPE may be fatal within a few hours unless</FONT> treated by descent or oxygen, and it is the most common cause of death related to high altitude. As with high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), recovery is usually complete, although, even with proper treatment (i.e., oxygen, prompt descent), a small percentage of very ill patients die. Patients who recover have rapid clearing of edematous fluid and do not develop fibrosis or other long-term sequelae.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">High-altitude cough</FONT> may be disabling at altitude because of paroxysmal coughing, chest pain from intercostal muscle strains and/or cough-induced rib fractures, and insomnia. High-altitude cough resolves with descent.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">History</FONT>: <BR>
HAPE occurs in the context of a recent ascent to altitudes higher than about 2500 m (8,200 ft). Additionally, patients often have a history of rapid ascent, with sleeping elevations increased by more than 300 m (1,000 ft) per night above 3000 m (9,800 ft).

Spontaneous diuresis<BR>
Nocturnal periodic breathing (e.g., Cheyne-Stokes respirations)<BR>
Frequent awakening at night<BR>
Weird or vivid dreams

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">
HAPE occurs in the first 2-4 days of ascent</FONT> to a new elevation, most often on the second night. HAPE typically worsens at night. The diagnosis requires 2 or more of the signs listed under Physical as well as 2 of the symptoms from the following list.

<P>Weakness, fatigue, or decreased exercise performance (most common and often the earliest sign)<BR>
Cough<BR>
Dyspnea at rest<BR>
Chest tightness or congestion<BR>
High-altitude cough<BR>
Paroxysmal cough, sometimes forceful enough to fracture 1 or more ribs<BR>
Frequently productive of purulent sputum<BR>
Absence of fever<BR>
Absence of dyspnea at rest<BR>
May lead to compromise of the airway<BR> 

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Physical Diagnosis</FONT>:<BR>
In addition to 2 or more of the previously listed symptoms, HAPE is diagnosed by presence of at least 2 of the following signs:<BR>
Crackles or wheezing in at least 1 lung field<BR>
Central cyanosis or significant arterial oxygen desaturation relative to altitude<BR>
Tachycardia<BR>
Tachypnea<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="">Other findings in HAPE may</FONT> include the following:<BR>
Fever (relatively common)<BR>
Orthopnea<BR>

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#006600">Altitude Basics, 101</FONT><BR>      
   
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">
Performing all forms of outdoor activity becomes</FONT> an increasing challenge as altitude increases.  Contrary to popular belief, your ability to perform at higher altitude is tied less to your physical condition, and tied more to your genetic stock.  Certain medical conditions such as asthma and high blood pressure can be aggravated by altitude.  If you use a little common sense and do some preparation, you will find that you will be able to perform most outdoor activities all the way to 15,000 feet with little discomfort and medical problems. 
<BR><BR><BR>

 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600">Sea Level to 3,500 Feet (1068 metres)</FONT><BR>   
A vast majority of the North American population lives in this altitude range.  Most people, except for those with extreme cardiopulmonary disorders can perform almost any activity at this level.  People who live at sea level will experience almost no noticeable ill effects when moving within this altitude range where the air pressure is around <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">12 psi</FONT> (pounds per square inch).
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#666633">3,500 Feet to 6,000 Feet (1830 metres)</FONT> <BR>   
Most people of ordinary health will have little problems at this altitude.  People who reside in areas that are below 2,500 feet may start to notice some breathing difficulty as they move above the 5,000 feet mark.  People who have cardiopulmonary disorders  may have serious problems in this altitude range and should consult a physician before visiting or engaging in outdoor sporting activity.  Women who are pregnant may also experience problems at this altitude due to the increased demand for oxygen that the fetus puts on their systems.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#660099">6,000 Feet to 10,000 Feet (3050 metres)</FONT> <BR>    
In this altitude range some people may start to experience problems related to altitude.  AMS, or Acute Mountain Sickness symptoms may set in at any altitude above 6,000 feet.  At 10,000 feet, <FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">the atmosphere is only 50% of that found at sea level</FONT>.  Breathing can become difficult, even for those in good physical condition.  Women who are pregnant and people with cardiopulmonary disorders should consult a physician before spending any time at these altitudes.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#996600">10,000 Feet to 14,000 Feet (4270 metres)</FONT> <BR>
Once you get above 10,000 feet the oxygen content in the atmosphere has reached levels that can be dangerously thin.  Not only is AMS a possibility, but the risk of HAPE or High Altitude Pulmonary Edema greatly increases over 12,000 feet.  To put this in proper perspective, private pilots who fly over 10,000 feet are required to use supplemental oxygen.  Most people that do mountaineering will climb in these altitudes.  Pregnant women, children under the age of two, and people who have cardiopulmonary disorders should not go above 10,000 feet in altitude.  Serious medical complications can occur in this range.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#990000">14,000 Feet to 18,000 Feet (5490 metres)</FONT><BR>   
Above 14,000 feet, a person enters an extreme altitude.  The atmosphere can be only 40% of that found at sea level, and air pressure can drop to below 10 psi, causing physiological stress on the body.  AMS, HAPE, and HACE or High Altitude Cerebral Edema can all be experienced in this altitude range.  Typically in North America, only extreme mountaineers will exceed these altitudes for any period of time.  This altitude range can be dangerous for any one, even those in good physical condition.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">18,000 Feet and Above</FONT><BR>   
Altitude above 18,000 feet is also called, “the death zone.”  As the air pressure falls to as low as 7 psi, the body, even with supplemental oxygen literally starts to die.  The severe onset of HAPE and HACE can occur at these altitudes and AMS symptoms are almost continuously experienced.  Only highly experienced mountaineers should venture into these altitudes, and a constant vigil has to be made for HAPE and HACE symptoms, with a focus on HACE symptoms as part of the symptoms for HACE is clouded judgment.

<P>Whether you prefer an activity holiday, nature and culture holiday, relaxation, spa treatment, or a language course, you will find our village to be an ideal base. 

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">General information </FONT><BR>
Le Village Catalan is a small village of 12 houses in the microclimatic foothills of snow-capped Canigou in the Pyrenees, between the ski resorts and the Mediterranean. It is known to have the best climate in France, with an average 300 days of sunshine per year, and it is rich on history, culture and natural beauty. 

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006633">
In the past Vernet-les-Bains has been the favoured health resort</FONT> of the British aristocracy, witnessed by the extravagant architecture of the casino and the parks. Europe’s largest wilderness area, the Pyrenees start just behind the village, with excellent opportunities for leisure activities, from hiking through mountain biking and fishing. A nearby waterfall has been named after the British - Cascades des Anglais. Famous Carcassonne, the tax free mini state Andorra, Spain and the Mediterranean beaches can be reached on day-trips. 

<P>Our little village is situated 5 minutes walk from Vernet-les-Bains centre, with all facilities - shops, restaurants and cafés, a sports centre, casino, thermal spa . Le Village Catalan comprises one, two and three bedroom houses on two levels, containing lounge with wooden beams and fireplace, kitchen, bathroom and all are equipped with simple but robust furnishing. 

<P>The architecture is medieval Catalan, but built as recent as 1965-1975 - it took ten years to build - and partly refurbished in 1998-2003. Each house is different and half the houses are built in granite stone. Each house has a private, sunny terrace with spectacular, unobstructible views of Vernet Les Bains, the valleys and the mountains. Six of the houses also have a private courtyard.

<FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="">Portable Altitude Chamber</FONT><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS)</FONT><BR>
As we ascend above 2500 metres (8000 feet) our bodies must acclimatise to the decreasing amount of oxygen available. Failure to acclimatise can result in AMS. 

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#990000">The symptoms of AMS may include any of</FONT> the following: headache, fatigue, loss of appetite, shortness of breath, cough, dizziness, blurred vision, vomiting, etc. The intensity and severity of these symptoms will vary, but can very quickly become extremely serious and even fatal.

<P>The only treatment for AMS is to descend to a lower altitude.

<P>However, there are many situations where immediate descent is difficult if not impossible, due to the hazards of weather, lack of manpower, difficult terrain or geography such as a plateau.
<BR><BR><BR>


<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#990000">
The pressure chamber concept has</FONT> been around for 20 years or more, yet the majority of trekkers and mountaineers going to high altitudes do so without this essential piece of safety equipment. The PAC is an Australian product, aimed at trekking groups, both private and commercial, as well as expeditions to high altitude. It is an answer to the need for an effective, simple, durable, lightweight and affordable pressure chamber for the treatment of AMS.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Effective</FONT><BR>
PAC technology has been shown to be highly effective in the reversal of symptoms of AMS. Depending on the starting altitude, simulated descents of about 2000 metres (6000 feet) are achieved at the operating pressure of 2 PSI above ambient pressure. 
 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Simple</FONT><BR>
The PAC has been designed to be as  simple to operate as possible. One operator can perform a complete treatment cycle on their own. A summary of the instructions found in the operator's manual are printed on the PAC itself, while all the valves are clearly labelled to avoid confusion. 
 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#000099">Light</FONT><BR>
The PAC, all up with pump, hose, manual repair kit and storage bag weighs in at less than 8 kgs. 

<P>PAC technology buys time and can stabilise or reverse severe symptoms of AMS before (or while) descent is undertaken.

INFLUENCE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND HYPOXIA ON BLOOD FLUIDITY: </FONT><BR> 

[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
Blood thickness is inversely dependent upon the membrane rigidity of the blood cells, which is conversely dependent on the rigidity of double-layered lipidic of the membrane of the red globule. A rise in saturated fatty acid connections lowers the number of non-saturated double connections and contributes to cell rigidity.</FONT>]


<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
Endurance exercises increases the rigidity of the red blood cells, providing an increase in the thickness of the blood. Hypoxia (lowered oxygen volume) of altitude reduces plasmic volume and induces a reduction in the thickness of the blood.</FONT>]


<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
Increases in duration and intensity of exercise together with increases in altitude, increases saturated fatty acid presence and decreases polyunsaturated fatty acids -- acid arachidonic (omega-6), EPA and DHA (omega-3). This increases membrane saturation with the amount of omega-6 and omega-3 correlating with an increase in red blood cell membrane rigidity. (similar in influence to an increase in cholesterol presence) and reducing the blood capacity to absorb and retain oxygen.</FONT>]


<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
During prolonged exercise, and at higher altitudes, blood cell changes produce reduced capillary efficiency, particularly in the lungs, liver, and spleen and reduced ability to carry and transfer oxygen to peripheral tissues. This induces an anaemia of iron deficiency by rupture of the red blood cells in the capillaries, under the effect of the rise in the cardiac flow and the blood pressure.

INFLUENCE of FISH OIL ABSORPTION ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE</FONT><BR> 
...


<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
Supplementation of diet with fish oil (omega-3 = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) suppresses the harmful blood fluidity changes encouraged by endurance exercises and high altitudes.</FONT>]


<P>...

<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
Fish oils reduce capillary resistance to oxygen uptake and increase blood circulation to peripheral areas. The efficiency of oxygen transfer from blood to muscle cells is enhanced by a reduction in tissue rigidity and an increase in red blood cell presence at the capillaries.</FONT>]


<P>[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
At higher altitudes and during endurance exercises, fish oils increase the oxygen desaturation of the haemoglobin, and, increases the blood concentration of lactic acid ... the consequence of metabolism of glucose (stored energy in cellular sugars). Also, adrenalin receptors on the cellular surfaces are sensitised by the addition of omega-3 ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) fish oils making glucose metabolism easier and faster.</FONT>]
<BR><BR><BR>

 
<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#006600">
PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES </FONT> <BR>
[<FONT SIZE="" COLOR="#990099">
For altitudes over 2000 m and for high endurance activities, a supplementation of 250 g of omega-3 fish oils 3 to 5 times per week ( = tuna, salmon, sardines, mackerel, lake trout, walnuts, pecans, almonds) is beneficial. To avoid a vitamin E deficiency from arising from the exercise and the additional polyunsaturated fatty acids, a supplementation with vitamin E is required. These changes will provide for better performance.</FONT>]

<B>Release of mercury from cellular binding can be enhanced by remaining at an altitude of 1800 to 2000 metres (5,800 to 6,400 feet) for a period of not less than 1 week with an early daily fluctuation by travel down to 0 to 100 metres and return within 4 to 6 hours. The early fluctuations encourage greater permeability of the cell wall for the release of mercury and other toxins. Living at the reduced pressure altitude facilitates the release of these toxins from the cells.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1" COLOR="#CC0000">
It can be fatal</FONT> to not be aware of the hazards/cautions and to ignore their significance. Detoxing too quickly can induce severe symptoms, panic response, and acute depression. Pacing is imperative.
