    is puddly and soft there are relatively wide spaces between the soil particles, there is a
    low percentage of the solid phase and both bulk density and hardness are low. These

    cause the soil to become more hard and compact by sun drying. According Cheng (1984) the

    long dry period in the dry season when groundwater levels drop below 60 cm depth will have
    a very positive effect on the next crop.The positive effect is attributed to better
    aeration of the soil, oxidation of toxic organic compounds and increased permeability by
    crack forming in the poorly drained clay soils. In wet years the drop of groundwater will
    hardly occur during the dry season. Therefore an field drainage system is required. For
    the Acid Sulphate soils it is essential that sufficient percolation can be applied after
    the dry season, during the next growing season. In these conditions the El Niño effect of
    1997/98 resulted in peak high yields for the following growing season in the Telang
    project of South Sumatra province.The same positive effect in acid sulphate soils has been
    recorded for the Saleh project (South Sumatra) in 1994/95, also after an extreme long dry
    season. Computer Model Simulations based on acid sulphate soil oxidation and leaching,
    also show that a deep drop of groundwater below the pyrite layer does not influence the
    toxicity in the next growing season, when normal percolation quantities (4-8 mm/day) are
    applied during the growing season of the rice.</font></td msimagelist>

and monitored in the Model areas. It proves that the most difficult operation is water
supply, because it requires frequent visits to the gates and careful watch of the tides
for a good result. For that reason water supply operation should be preferable carried out
near the home-stead's. (SPD secondary canal). Controlled drainage is the most easy
operation and should be preferable carried out on the other side (SDU secondary canal).
