            <p>In the tradition of heaving stockings, bulging packages and stuffed 
              stomachs the contents of this year's Epic Christmas newsletter are 
              overflowing. We have added a couple of features including an e-learning 
              diary showing the most important dates in the first half of 2005. 
              Epic will be exhibiting at a number of locations during the year, 
              the first of which will be the Learning Technologies show starting 
              on January 26th in Olympia, London. Epic will be on stand 62 - if 
              you would like an invitation to the show please <a href="mailto:marketing@epic.co.uk">contact 
              us</a>. Following on from last month's iPod learning White Paper, 
              this month's jamboree publication features a review of downloadable 
              audio files by Steve Rayson and Donald Clark has summarised the 
              year's e-learning events. As usual, we welcome your comments and 
              suggestions and I would like to extend personal thanks for your 
              continued support throughout this year. Have a very Merry Christmas 
              and a Happy New Year - see you in 2005.</p>

            <p align="left">1. A short round-up of the year by Donald Clark, Epic</p>
            <p align="left">2004 was the year of the monkey and, true to form, 
              there was a great deal of monkey business going on.</p>
            <p>In January we had the now infamous Towards a Unified e-Learning 
              Strategy. It was a sort of educational tract/DfES deapartmental 
              plan, completely missing the commercial sector. End of January was 
              the deadline for responses to the Government's Consultation Document. 
              We are still waiting on the results! Someone mentioned February 
              2005. In the meantime, things have moved with informal learning 
              and a dozen other market shifts.</p>
            <p>Throughout the year some consolidation was seen in the US, notably 
              the Docent and click2learn merger in March. In June Blackboard had 
              hugely successful float on NASDAQ, but their competitors such as 
              eCollege, Corinthian Colleges and DeVry continue to suffer. In the 
              corporate sector we&#8217;re still waiting on Sumtotal to sort out 
              the merger. Skillsoft have stabilised, however poor product perceptions 
              continue.</p>
            <p>In the UK KnowledgePool and ACT went into receivership while the 
              UkeU collapsed with a Select Committee grilling the Chair and Chief 
              Executive of HEFCE, especially the bonuses for 30 of the 70 staff. 
              November saw the NHSU merge down into a new NHS Institute.</p>
            <p>Merry Xmas </p>

            <p>2. Informal Learning</p>
            <p>Informal, casual, instant, spot, embedded or workflow learning 
              is now recognised as perhaps the most important form of adult learning, 
              quantifiably more important than formal learning interventions. 
              We all know that over a lifetime, most of what we learn is not within 
              the context of a college, classroom or course. We develop daily 
              through natural exploration, exposure and encounters with knowledge 
              and people. It has even been described as learning that &#8216;takes 
              place at subconscious levels&#8217; Rusaw (1995). </p>

            <p><span class="leftnav">3a. A practical guide to accessible e-learning</span></p>
            <p><span class="leftnav">Providing accessible e-learning is becoming 
              ever more critical in today's marketplace. It is not just a legal 
              requirement, but can confer a competitive advantage on the organisations 
              who make the effort to ensure that their e-learning is accessible.</span></p>
            <p>A new report commissioned by the CIPD from Epic depicts the current 
              state of play, and provides practical recommendations on how organisations 
              should approach this thorny issue. Case studies illustrate how some 
              other organisations are going about providing accessible e-learning 
              without losing any interactivity or engagement.</p>
            <p>The full report will be available in the next few days for free 
              download via the CIPD website (<a href="http://www.cipd.co.uk">www.cipd.co.uk</a>).</p>

            <p><span class="leftnav">Want to learn? Then stop trying. </span></p>
            <p>Research released in November 2004 suggests that, in some circumstances, 
              we learn best when we are not thinking about something too much. 
              Dr Paul Fletcher published his findings in Cerebral Cortex. </p>
            <p>The experiment was very clever involving the pressing of buttons 
              in response to screen information. What the learners did not know, 
              was that there were hidden sequences. Bizarrely those who simply 
              went on to push the buttons did well, even denying that there were 
              any sequences. When people were actively looking for the sequence, 
              they did not show any evidence of getting faster or better. In fact, 
              it appears that explicitly trying to learn obliterates implicit 
              learning. </p>
            <p>What&#8217;s going on here?</p>
            <p>Their results indicated that the frontal lobes were most active 
              during explicit learning, which was when they were looking for the 
              sequence but showed least improvement in performance. It was also 
              the case that, under this condition, the frontal lobes showed a 
              very different relationship with other key brain regions and interacting 
              with them in a different way than under circumstances in which subjects 
              were performing the task optimally. </p>
            <p>As Dr Fletcher said, 'This study shows that our frontal lobes, 
              although thought to be the seat of higher human psychological function, 
              may, under certain circumstances, be more of a hindrance than a 
              help. That is, as many sportspeople have already discovered for 
              themselves, there are certain circumstances under which we should 
              stop deliberating and just act.' </p>
            <p>This is an interesting finding and, in a small way supports the 
              idea of embedded or workflow learning, as opposed to separate learning 
              interventions. </p>

                INTERVIEW</span></h2>
              <p align="left">4. <span class="leftnav">Given the chance, Epic 
                loves to hear the opinions and experiences of influential figures 
                within the learning industry. You may remember we ran an interview 
                with John Brown of Ufi Ltd. back in October. This month, Lee Maxey, 
                Chief Learning Officer at Pathlore, has generously answered our 
                e-learning questionnaire. The questionnaire aims to get personal 
                views, rather than general thoughts on the state of the market 
                and the questions have been designed acccordingly. </span></p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Introduction by Donald Clark, Epic</strong></p>
              <p align="left"><span class="leftnav">Lee Maxey has been a constant 
                source of inspiration for me. We have bumped into each other at 
                many conferences in many cities and I'm always amazed at the freshness 
                of his thoughts. One of his most endearing habits is his ability 
                to change his mind. Having promoted the idea of LCMSs, he now 
                sees them as red herrings. As an American who spent his early 
                years in Europe, he can also see things from both sides of the 
                pond. His sheer enthusiasm for learning and the internet comes 
                through in this interview. </span></p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Q What's your INTEREST in learning/online 
                learning?</strong></p>
              <p align="left">I LOVE learning. My view is that if one is not learning, 
                then one is not really living. As a student, competitive athlete, 
                teacher, coach, and now as a parent, I continue to be amazed at 
                how different learning can be depending on one&#8217;s perspective. 
                Online learning is not the issue as much as one&#8217;s view of 
                learning as a whole. Having the understanding and appreciation 
                of how learning can change one&#8217;s world is far more important 
                than the delivery vehicle for learning.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Q What interactive technology do you use 
                and have at HOME?</strong></p>
              <p align="left">We have a wireless DSL connection to the internet 
                and a basic TV. We don&#8217;t watch much TV. Our use of the internet 
                ranges from email, to shopping, to searches for needed information, 
                to finding kids resources.</p>
              <p align="left"><strong>Q What stands out as your MOST EFFECTIVE 
                learning experience?</strong></p>
              <p align="left">Wood Badge training for Boy Scout Leaders and flight 
                school training to be a pilot were both powerful learning experiences. 
                They both were totally immersive, and continue to impact how I 
                think about learning today. One was a team-based collaborative 
                experience that involved a lot of behavioural and a &#8220;soft 
                skill&#8221; focus. The other was an intense solitary activity 
                with high degrees of precision and procedure.</p>

              <p align="left">5a. Audio Review: Will Wright &#8211; Simulation 
                Design</p>
              <p align="left">At Epic we have all been excited recently by the 
                potential of audio files and iPods as learning devices. Thus when 
                I came across an audio file by Will Wright on <a href="http://www.itconversations.com">www.itconversations.com</a> 
                I downloaded it to my iPod and began listening. Will Wright, for 
                those that don&#8217;t know, was the founder of Maxis, the company 
                that created the world&#8217;s best selling PC game The Sims. 
                This is a game that my daughter spends many hours playing and 
                hence I was also interested to understand the way the game was 
                designed.</p>
              <p align="left">Will is also a very amusing speaker and interesting 
                individual. He explained that when he gets a new game the first 
                thing he does is work out what you have to do and then do the 
                complete opposite i.e. drive the wrong way on a racing game. He 
                also likes his children to experiment in the same way and added 
                &#8220;do you know that Barbie&#8217;s hair is flammable?&#8221; 
                I personally liked his style which made me listen on. </p>

                Podcasting is like subscribing to a set of news feeds except that 
                rather than read them on screen you can listen at your PC or on 
                an iPod. There are many podcasting feeds you can subscribe to 
                at <a href="http://www.ipodder.org">www.ipodder.org</a>. These 
                include regular podcasts from US Universities on education and 
                technology. Even the BBC is getting in on the act. You can now 
                sign up to the &#8220;In our Time&#8221; podcast where Melvyn 
                Bragg and three guests investigate the history of ideas and debate 
                their application in modern life. Just go to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3_podcast.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3_podcast.shtml</a>. 
                This automatically delivers a new audio file to your PC whenever 
                the BBC updates it. Alternatively if you just want to download 
                the file manually go to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/mp3.shtml</a>.

              <p align="left">6. Online Educa Berlin 2004</p>
              <p align="left">Epic's Donald Clark recently spoke at the Online 
                Educa international conference in Berlin. Here is his report of 
                the show.</p>
              <p align="left">Online Educa is 10 years old this year and remains 
                the leading European e-learning conference with:</p>
            </div>
            <ul>
              <li> 
                <div align="left">1700 registered participants from 60 countries</div>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <div align="left">attendees from 63 countries</div>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <div align="left">344 speakers from 43 countries</div>
              </li>
              <li> 
                <div align="left">71 themed sessions</div>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <div align="right"> 
              <p align="left">It&#8217;s an eclectic mix of researchers, educationalists, 
                corporates and policy makers. Note that this doesn&#8217;t mean 
                any real interaction between them. Indeed there were some fractious 
                sessions and more than the odd culture clash (more of this later). 
                In many ways this is what makes this an interesting event. </p>
              <p align="left">A strong feature of the conference is the short 
                speaker slots. Three or four speakers per session means they&#8217;re 
                limited to about 20 mins each. This lowers the odds on boredom, 
                and as the speakers still have to pay to attend the quality can 
                be variable. In fact, this year, there was some disgruntlement 
                around &#8216;presentation skills&#8217;.</p>

                      <p align="left">Healthcare in the US has surprisingly low 
                        levels of training spend with many hospitals facing shrinking 
                        budgets, an unsophisticated infrastructure but a highly 
                        technical and diverse audience and 24/7 operations. However, 
                        they have lots of external training requirements &#8211; 
                        especially in health and safety.</p>
                      <p align="left">Joint Commission for Accreditation of Healthcare 
                        Organisations (JCAHO), an accreditation body that requires 
                        documented annual training. Then there&#8217;s the Office 
                        of Inspector General (OIG) where compliance is backed 
                        up with huge penalties on fraud and abuse allegations. 
                        Hospitals therefore need compliance plans and need to 
                        adhere to National standards. Clinical professionals also 
                        need annual training. It is imperative that they receive 
                        annual training. The Risk Management Issues are enormous, 
                        especially around professional liability and malpractice 
                        issues.</p>
