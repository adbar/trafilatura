                  <BR> <span class="content">Competition is what the free market 
                  is all about, and the supply and trading of energy have gone 
                  through turbulent times. Meanwhile, more than 10% of electricity 
                  use is traded on the APX every year, and the trading floor has 
                  made its energy company debut. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  Supply and trading are two entirely different disciplines within 
                  the energy market, yet they are often mentioned in the same 
                  breath. This is hardly surprising, since they have many similarities. 
                  Whoever supplies energy to the end user wants to buy and resell 
                  his product as cheaply as possible. A flourishing trade in electricity 
                  and gas has come about as a result of increased energy liberalisation, 
                  which has caused prices to be determined according to the law 
                  of supply and demand. The shrewdest market player can offer 
                  the lowest prices to the client, and is thus a step ahead of 
                  the competition.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  As the grid-administration function was split further within 
                  the traditional energy companies, the difference between the 
                  trading and supply divisions became more marked. The supplying 
                  company, originally little more than the client administration 
                  responsible for sending and collecting periodic energy bills, 
                  is now the commercial heart of the organisation. It has become 
                  the most important point of reference for the client, the sales 
                  and marketing office and the information counter. Client friendliness, 
                  efficiency and service orientation are now central to this branch. 
                  The three largest electricity-generating companies, Reliant, 
                  Electrabel and E.ON Benelux all have their own supply and trading 
                  company. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  </span> <span class="kopVet">Customise</span><BR>
                  <BR> <span class="content">Particularly with the opening of 
                  the market for medium-sized users from January 1st 2002, this 
                  new supply company identity has come clearly to the fore. Suppliers 
                  attempt to entice each other's clients with favourable, customised 
                  contracts. In addition to energy, they offer a series of other 
                  services, like advice on energy saving and the installation 
                  of heating and cooling systems. Renewable energy has also become 
                  an important product in its own right. The market for green 
                  power has been entirely free since July 1st 2001, and consumers 
                  now have the freedom to switch to another supplier.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  Any company is free to offer energy in a liberalised energy 
                  market. The opening-up of the market for medium-sized customers 
                  therefore has attracted a series of newcomers to the market. 
                  These are existing foreign companies, such as the German EnBW 
                  and the Swedish Vattenfall, who supply commercial clients. Several 
                  new companies are also active in the market, such as Spark Energy 
                  (subsequently taken over by the generator Electrabel Nederland), 
                  Energiebedrijf.com and Anode. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  </span> <span class="kopVet">Practising</span><BR>
                  <BR> <span class="content">In anticipation of the opening-up 
                  of the consumer market (expected on July 1st 2004), suppliers 
                  may already 'practise' on the green-power market. However, a 
                  permit is required from the Ministry of Economic Affairs in 
                  order to supply consumers; the permit is issued by the regulator 
                  DTe. Among the newcomers to the green power market are Echte 
                  Energie, Greenchoice and Shell Stroom. The supply of regular 
                  'grey' electricity and gas to small users is still reserved 
                  for the traditional energy companies. Their tariffs for these 
                  clients will be regulated by the DTe until the opening-up of 
                  the market in 2004. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  A new discipline in this arena is the trade in electricity and 
                  gas. Although raw materials for energy generation were indeed 
                  traded in the traditional, centrally-led energy market, trade 
                  in the end product was unnecessary because tariffs were set 
                  by the government and levelled out in a pooling system. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  There is increasing competition in generation within the free 
                  market, mutually between the Dutch generators but also with 
                  imported gas or electricity. Suppliers also look for the most 
                  favourable contract to meet their requirements. These are partly 
                  long-term contracts, but a short-term market has come into existence 
                  alongside these. The majority of this trade still takes place 
                  via bilateral 'Over the Counter' (OTC) contracts, which have 
                  a great degree of flexibility. In addition, the Amsterdam Power 
                  Exchange (APX), established in 1999, is an exchange where electricity 
                  for the following day is traded. Market parties can also make 
                  use of a broker, an intermediary who mediates on behalf of a 
                  client or other dealer.<BR>
                  <BR>
                  The energy market is increasingly looking for opportunities 
                  to apply the kind of derivatives generally accepted in the financial 
                  world. The APX is also investigating the possibilities with 
                  regard to a marketplace for financial derivates, such as futures 
                  and forwards. In this way, parties can cover their market position 
                  by 'insuring' themselves against ups and downs. For the time 
                  being, the trade in such energy derivates takes place along 
                  the bilateral route. New gas-dealing opportunities arise when 
                  market parties can meet. An example is the Eurohub set up by 
                  Gasunie on the German border. At this 'transfer centre' parties 
                  from Germany, Norway and the Netherlands can deal in gas. <BR>
                  <BR>
                  The largest Dutch energy companies now have their own trading 
                  floors. This is not only the case for generation companies, 
                  but also for major suppliers, such as Essent, Nuon and ENECO 
                  Energie. Since the latter two hardly have any generation resources 
                  to supply their own client base with energy, to a large extent 
                  they are dependent on purchasing. NUON has announced its intention 
                  to take over the Dutch power stations belonging to Reliant Energy, 
                  an American company. In addition, over the years various foreign 
                  companies have become active in Dutch energy trading, including 
                  some from the United States, Great Britain and Germany. For 
                  the time being, most confine themselves to the industrial market, 
                  while a few have turned their attention to the market for medium-sized 
                  clients.<BR>
