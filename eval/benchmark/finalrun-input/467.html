<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>1. Stewards and
domestics in the Mycenaean period</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">So much has been
written about slavery in ancient Greece that one feels one is bringing
&quot;blue skies to Athens&quot; <font size="1"> </font>by contributing even
more <font size="1">(1)</font><b>. </b>However, if we consider the question using strictly historical
criteria -- thereby freeing ourselves from opinions based upon the later
development of the institution -- we may then be able to begin to form a
different view of this matter than the one we may now have.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The first word,
therefore, which characterizes that which will later come to be called slavery,
is <i>thmós, </i>for the male, and <i>thmoïs </i>for
the female<b>. </b>This translates in current usage as &quot; person of the
house<b>.</b>&quot; As an example, Homer informs us that Laértes, the father of
Odysseus, has male servants to tend his orchard and garden, as well as an old
woman to care for him<b>. </b>His son's palace has 50 female servants, whose
most arduous physical labor is the grinding of flour<b>. </b>The head <i>thmoïs
</i>[stewardess] may have the keys to the storerooms and complete authority over
the other servants<b>. </b>Goatherds, farm workers, those who work as craftsmen,
as well as charioteers, horse trainers, and others, give us a picture of a
community of people who --&nbsp; because each had his or her special place in Mycenaean
society -- could in no way be characterized as inferior<b>. </b>This is the
inescapable conclusion one comes to after a careful reading of the <i>Iliad</i>
and the <i>Odyssey</i>, where one can't help but notice that the behavior of the
male and female servants toward their freeborn masters, and the way
their masters interact with them, never gives the reader the
slightest hint of their relatively inferior positions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The bondman or
house servant, therefore, represents an active member of the Mycenaean <i>oikogénia
</i>[&quot;family,&quot; normally under the protection of a patriarch]<b>. </b>One
might even say that what we've been describing represents a rudimentary form of
adoption, which commences as soon as the servant is brought into the household<b>.
</b>Not uncommonly, bonds of affection often develop between the master and the slave, which we see characterized, as an example, in the Homeric
epics<b>. </b>In the <i>Odyssey</i>, Anticléa [Odysseus' mother], the mistress of the
palace, treats the young slave Eumaéus as her own son<b>. </b>He is nurtured
alongside and in the same way as the daughter of the household, Ctiméne<b>. </b>When
he grows to young manhood, she worries about his safety and well-being<b>. </b>And
when Anticléa dies, her daughter-in-law, Penelope, assumes the responsibility
of his protection<b>. </b>She also takes on the upbringing and care of the daughter of
Dólius, her own old and faithful servant<b>. </b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">When the suitors
take over Odysseus' palace, bringing with them a tense and worrisome
atmosphere, Eumaéus bemoans the diminishment of the tenderness and
dedication to which he had become so accustomed<b>. </b>As we read in the <i>Odyssey</i>, he complains<b>: </b>&quot;Now everything is gone<b>. </b>If the gods
have allowed me, through my labor, to accomplish something in my life<b>;</b> if I have
food to eat and wine to drink, it is as nothing to me because I can no longer
hear the sweet voice of my master, or the tender affections shown me by my
mistress.&quot; </p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Also touching, is
the fact that when Odysseus returns to Ithaka the first people he turns to for
help are not his freeborn friends and fellow archons, but his slaves, Eumaéus, Philoétius, Dólius, and the six sons of
Dólius<b>.</b>&nbsp;<b> </b>The same is true with the
female slaves of the palace, of whom only twelve, from a total of fifty, have
deserted to the suitors in spite of the many long years that their master has
been away<b>. </b>All
the rest, as soon as they see him, &quot;... surround him, taking him by the
hand, and greeting him warmly<b>. </b>And he, feeling a great emotion welling up
in his chest, tries to control a sweet desire to shed tears of joy, for in his
heart he recognizes each and every one of them.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">But let us return
to Eumaéus, a typical herdsman and slave of the Mycenaean age<b>. </b>We see
that he lives independently at some distance from the palace<b>. </b>He has his
own bread, barley flour, and wine in goodly quantities<b>.</b> He slaughters as
many of the animals in his charge as he desires and whenever he chooses, for
himself and his visitor<b>. </b>He wears a well-formed tunic, good sandals,
and has two cloaks of wild goatskin<b>;</b> one for good weather, and a heavier
one for when it rains<b>.&nbsp; </b>He has a sturdy house of stone, with a
hallway, portico, fireplace, and enough room to allow him to offer hospitality
to guests<b>. </b>Most important of all, over time, and with no outside help,
he's been able to purchase his own slave using his own money<b>. </b>He even has
the right to be armed, as we see in the <i>Odyssey</i> when he offers Odysseus
the hospitality of his home and stands guard outside with a sword and javelin
while his guest is sleeping.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Even Odysseus'
father, old Laértes, can often be found sleeping by the fireplace in the
palace, on the floor, along with the household slaves<b>.</b> So we see -- going
all the way back to the time when we have the first written accounts on the
subject of slavery in ancient Greece -- that it can in no way be compared to how
the institution developed in later periods and in other lands.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>2.&nbsp; Slavery in the classical period</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let us see what
develops later on<b>. </b>In the ensuing years the terms <i>thmós</i> and <i>thmoïs
</i>evolve into <i>oikétys </i>and <i>oikétis</i>, because they came into the
home [<i>óikos</i>] and became a member, or <i>país</i> [child], of the
family, which attests to the tenderness with which they were surrounded<b>.</b>
When an <i>oikétys</i>  first entered a home, the mistress of the house gave him figs,
walnuts, and other such tidbits to eat, in order to let him know that from that
time on his life would be sweet and full of good fortune<b>. </b>Slaves took part in
all of the religious holidays, and even participated in the Great Mysteries,
such as those which honored Demeter and Persephóne at Eleusis<b>. </b>Also, on
the first day of the Anthestérion in Athens, and the Iakínthian in Sparta, as
well as at other festivals in Arcadia, the slaves sat at the same tables
with their masters, and were therefore referred to as <i>omóphagoi </i>[dinner
companions]<b>. </b>At Epídauros, the temple to Athena belonged to the slaves,
and the Great Priest of this holy shrine had to be a runaway slave, who was also
a fierce fighter as well<b>. </b>The slave in a home took part in all of the
religious observances of the household, and participated in the holidays which
were held sacred by the family<b>. </b>At his death, he would be buried in the
family tomb.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Should a slave
suffer bad treatment at the hands of his master, he had the right to seek
sanctuary at certain sacred places, such as the Temple of Theséus in Athens, or
the Temple of the Erínyes, located beneath the Hill of Ares, and
legally claim the right to be sold to another master<b>. </b>A decision of the court was
required for a slave to be put to death<b>. </b>There were also special laws
governing the rights and treatment of slaves besides that of sanctuary<b>: </b><i>Xenía</i>
[hospitality, which forbade mistreatment], specific laws having to do with their
protection, and a law which granted them the right to own property, called <i>éngtisis</i>
[possession of property in a foreign country]<b>. </b>The murder of a slave
carried the same punishment as the murder of a freeborn citizen, and from the
time of Solon [the great Athenian lawgiver], the beating or ill-treatment of
a slave was punishable by law.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">As for the talents
and capabilities of slaves, we know, first of all, that many were competent
doctors<b>: </b>practitioners who were trained along with some of the great
physicians of the ancient Greek world<b>. </b>This became such a common phenomenon
that the [Roman] emperor Domition, in the first century A.D., imposed a law
forbidding the medical training of slaves because they had become too numerous<b>.
</b>Ermíppos, the [one-eyed Athenian] writer of comedies of the second century
A.D., even wrote a book about all of the distinguished authors of his time who
were slaves<b>. </b>Some of these were Pómpylos, Persáios, Mýs, and Mónimos,
philosophers and slaves of Theophrástus, Zénon, Epicúrus, and
lastly, a banker from Corinth respectively<b>. </b>The Stoic philosopher, Epictétus, who
lived and flourished in the first century A.D., was not only born a slave in
Phrygia, but was disabled as well<b>. </b>The philosopher Pháedo [in whose
honor Plato named his famous dialogue], was brought to Athens as a slave, became
a devout student of Socrates after gaining his freedom, and ultimately opened
his own school of philosophy in Elis<b>. </b>Ménippus, of Gadara, in Syria [3rd century
B.C.], was a slave who was brought to Greece where he became wealthy<b>. </b>After
buying his freedom, he studied philosophy and eventually became the originator of the serio-comic style [<i>spouthogélion</i>]
of writing, authoring a total of thirteen books<b>.</b>&nbsp;Bion, the
Borysthenite [4th/3rd centuries B.C.], was the slave of a rich rhetorician who, when
he died, left everything to him<b>. </b>Bion had already received an excellent
education provided for him by his master<b>.</b> After his master's death, he
moved to Athens where he studied philosophy at the Perípatos (under
Theophrástus) and the Academy (under Xenocrátes)<b>. </b>He became a famous
Cynic philosopher, and his writings later strongly influenced Roman satire.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Slaves were to be
found in
many professions, trades, and crafts<b>.&nbsp;</b>From the ancient rhetoricians,
we learn that they worked as metallurgists, rope makers, pharmacists, iron
workers, musical instrument makers, roof tile craftsmen, cooks, and even civil
servants<b>. </b>From a catalogue which names 66 recently freed slaves, together
with the work they did before gaining their freedom, we find farmers, merchants
of flax, salt meat, vegetables, incense, and sesame<b>. </b>There were<b> </b>middle-men, shop keepers,
goldsmiths, cobblers, foundry workers, lead and silver molders, metal workers,
scribes, legal secretaries, engravers, and others.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">As we mentioned
above, slaves also worked for the state as civil servants<b>. </b>These were
divided into two categories<b>: </b>laborers and clerks<b>. </b>Life for the
clerks was much better than it was for the laborers<b>. </b>As &quot;office
workers&quot; for the state, they had the right to live in their own homes with
their own furnishings<b>. </b>They could accumulate wealth, which became part of
their personal estate<b>. </b>They were free to marry and to raise their children<b>.
</b>They took part in the sacred ceremonies and processions of their respective
cities<b>. </b>One such clerk, whose name has come down to us, was Pittalákos, who lived a prosperous life and would frequent the courts of Athens
like a freeborn citizen<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The city police [<i>astinómi</i>]<b>
</b>were also civil servants<b>.&nbsp;</b>In Athens, these were comprised of
Scythian bowmen who policed all of the residents of the <i>polis </i>[city],
including the freeborn citizens and the <i>vouleftés</i> [members of
parliament]<b>.</b> These Scythians were slaves, and were employed by the city,
as were the guardians of public buildings, and the inspectors of weights and
measures in the public markets<b>. </b>The majority of the town heralds,
constables, and clerks of the city courts and accounting departments were slaves<b>.
</b>Those whose responsibility included the guarding of the treasury of the
armed forces were slaves, as were most of those who kept and guarded the
official archives of the city<b>. </b>At the Pnyx <font size="1">(2)</font>,
slave civil servants sat directly behind the President, ready to provide him
with the text of some relevant law or ruling pertaining to the matter under
consideration<b>. </b>In fact, when it was decided that a revision of the law codes
of Athens needed to be done, the responsibility for this important task was
entrusted to a civil servant by the name of Nicómachus, a slave, who, as chief
archivist of the courts, was the man most qualified for the job.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>3.&nbsp; The
Economic condition of the slaves</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Another very
important category of slaves was that of the &quot;undomiciled&quot; [<i>xorís
oíkountes</i>], that is, those slaves who lived and worked independently, and
who kept their wages or profits&nbsp; for themselves<i> </i>(except for a small
fee -- usually one or two obols <font size="1">(3) </font>a day -- which was
paid to their &quot;master&quot;)<b>. </b>These slaves had all of the rights and
privileges of the aforementioned civil servants<b>: </b>economic independence, a
family, and a home of their own<b>. </b>We are fortunate here, because the names
and histories of some of these individuals have come down to us<b>. </b>One
such, is Phormíon, the right hand man of the banker, Pasíon, a slave himself
who, after gaining his freedom, went on to become the wealthiest banker and
manufacturer in Athens (we will say more about these two anon)<b>. </b>We also
know that Tímarchus <font size="1">(4)</font> allowed his slaves to operate a
shoe-making factory as a partnership, requiring only that he be paid a fee of
two obols per day for each worker, and three obols per day for the chief
craftsman<b>.</b> And that another slave of the household of the Athenian
Chrysippus was the manager of a branch of the factory located on the Bosporus.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">From what has been
written so far, we can -- for Athenian society at least --come to the general
conclusion<b> </b> that we are dealing here with a very vibrant and
important slave presence in the productive, agricultural, industrial, civil, and
economic life of the city<b>. </b>The only field in which we do not see a strong
participation by slaves is in the armed forces in general, and in the navy in
particular -- except in times of dire necessity, such as at the sea-battle of
Arginúsae in 406 B.C.-- <font size="1">(5), </font>and it is only proper that
one wonder why this was so<b>. </b>Surely it wasn't because of a lack of trust
in their loyalty, for we've seen that they were entrusted with many key
positions in the Athenian community<b>.</b> Besides, mercenaries and metics <font size="1">(6)</font>
were used as oarsmen in the navy, along with the poorest citizens, so why were
slaves not used as well?<b> </b>Nor was it because the work of a <i>thranítas</i>
<font size="1">(7) </font>was thought to be too arduous (especially when
compared to that of a clerk, a bank employee, or a craftsman)<b>. </b>Why then,
since there are those who are anxious to convince us that the ancient Greeks
mistreated their slaves, did they not use them in the dangerous and laborious
job of oarsmen in the Athenian fleet? The answer is strictly economic, and has
to do with the fact that, in the period under consideration, the Athenian
citizen underclass was suffering from severe economic hardship<b>. </b>Some were
literally starving, in contrast to the large population of resident slaves who
had a virtual monopoly on commerce and the marketplace, and service as an oarsman in the navy
represented the&nbsp; &quot;last refuge&quot; from economic deprivation for the lowest
classes of the freeborn poor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In this way, a <i>thranítas</i>
earning from 3 to 6 obols a day <font size="1">(8) </font>could feed his family<b>.
</b>It was, in other words, the one sure way of finding gainful employment at a
time when most of the other professions and trades were in the hands of either
the slaves or the metics<b>. </b>And to make the tragic state of the Athenian
citizen-poor even clearer, it is enough to relate that, after the defeat of the
Athenians in the Lamian War of 322 B.C., of the 31,000 freeborn Athenian
soldiers who took part, 22,000 lost their civil rights as citizens because their
net worth had fallen below the qualifying threshold of 2000 drachmas<b>. </b>We
know as well, that in the 5th century B.C. large numbers of Athenian citizens
were forced by dire necessity, and under very difficult conditions, to become <i>
kléruchs</i>&nbsp;<font size="1"> </font>in various Athenian <i> klerouchía</i> <font size="1">(9)</font>,
far from their native city<b>. </b>On the other hand, when we look at the
fortunes of the wealthiest citizens of Athens in the 4th century B.C., we see
that the wealth of Demosthenes, the famous orator, did not exceed 14 talents <font size="1">(10),
</font>whereas the &quot;slave,&quot; Pasíon, was worth between 75 to 80
talents upon his death, and only Díphilus, with 160 talents, and Epicrátes
with 600, exceeded Pasíon in wealth.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">But let us take a
closer look at Pasíon<b>. </b>It is not clear whether he bought or rented the
bank of his former employer<b>. </b>Soon after taking it over, however, Pasíon
was sued by a client for misuse of funds amounting to about 7 talents<b>. </b>Not
only was Pasíon exonerated, he never lost the confidence of his many depositors<b>.
</b>Besides<b> </b>being the owner of a bank, Pasíon also owned a factory where
he manufactured shields<b>. </b>He was a generous donor to good causes, and in
376 B.C. even became an Athenian citizen<b>. </b>It was then that he began to
invest heavily in real estate<b>.</b> He loaned the Athenian <i>strategós </i>[commander],
Timotheus, money for the needs of the fleet in 373/372 B.C., and even equipped
five ships himself<b>. </b>As we mentioned above, at his death his net worth was
estimated to be between 75 to 80 talents, a colossal amount of money in those
days<b>. </b>It is interesting to note that when he retired he leased his bank
and his shield manufactory to his slave, Phormíon, for 10,000 and 6,000
drachmas [per year] respectively.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">But this begs the
question<b>: </b>Where did Phormíon, a slave, find such large sums of money in
order to be able to pay off his &quot;master,&quot; Pasíon? And these two are not the
only slaves to become prominent bankers<b>. </b>We know of others as well, like
Kítto, Evmáthi, Socrates [not the philosopher], Timódemos, and Sátiros, all
of whom also married the widows of their former &quot;masters,&quot; as did
Phormíon<b>. </b>On the other side of the coin, regarding those who earned
their bread by working for it by the &quot;sweat of their brow,&quot; we offer
the following information<b>: </b>In 408 B.C., in a survey of 55 different
manual trades, only 36% were being performed by citizens<b>; </b>in 328 B.C., of 74 such trades, 27% were being performed by citizens<b>;</b>
and in Eleusís [about 20 miles from Athens], in 329/328 B.C., of 94 trades
surveyed, only 21% were in the hands of citizens<b>. </b>From a listing of 27
contractors and small business employers from the same period, we see only 9
citizens, or 33% of the total<b>. </b>Another list of a total of 41 merchants,
shows only11 citizens,
or 27%<b>; </b>and from 15 bidders [for public works projects] we find only 2
citizens, or 13%.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">So that the Athenian citizens not only had to compete against the slaves and
their freeborn compatriots, they had also to contend with the very tough competition of
the metics<b>.&nbsp;</b>One can easily see that they were confronted with a
dead-end situation as regards the ways and means by which they were able to earn
a living<b>. </b>The only fields in which freeborn citizens formed the majority
were those of keepers of flocks and herds, animal husbandry, mule and oxcart
transport, exporters of asbestos, the armed forces, and in the manufacture of
bricks and tiles<b>. </b>All other means of livelihood in the economy were in
the hands of the metics,&nbsp; slaves, and slaves who'd been manumitted<b>. </b>These
slaves and former slaves slowly but steadily came to dominate the marketplace
completely, eventually replacing even the metics, who began to withdraw from the
manual trades in order to seek other means of earning a steadier, easier, more
dependable living<b>. </b>The result was a dramatic decrease in their numbers
after 355 B.C.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">But in the period
under consideration here, we see that it's the metics, slaves and former slaves
who, having little or nothing to lose, are the entrepreneurs<b>. </b>They are
the ones who engage in the kind of high-risk ventures that, when successful, are
the most profitable<b>. </b>On the other hand, the freeborn citizens stick
mostly to those activities that are less profitable but not as risky<b>. </b>What
counts most for the freeborn is to not lose their land, and so we witness the
citizens of this period staying away from commercial initiatives that entail
putting venture capital at risk<b>. </b>So that a situation develops where, 1)
the metics and the slaves -- not having any ties at all with the land of Attica
-- predominate in the arena of commerce, together with an ever-shrinking
residual of extremely rich Athenian citizens who are &quot;hanging on.&quot; 2)<b>
</b>The aforementioned &quot;undomiciled&quot; slaves are able to command good
salaries as independent agents, or as &quot;rented-out&quot; craftsmen. And 3)
the vast majority of the population, comprised mainly of poor Athenian citizens,
struggle for their daily bread, and, if there is no other recourse, hire out as
day laborers for the slaves and metics, who are supposedly their
&quot;inferiors.&quot;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">So that we have,
for example, the citizen Ameinías, a basket maker, who must sell his baskets
for a measly one drachma apiece [thereby barely scraping out a living], while in
the shop next door, the metic Phílon, an iron merchant, does a land-office
business<b>. </b>Or Diïtrephis, a citizen demolition contractor, who, because
he is desperate for work, agrees to a contract for a mere 45 drachmas, for which
sum he has to provide the scaffolding, whereas the metic Philoklís asks 300
drachmas just for the excavation<b>. </b>Demosthenes, in his public orations,
talks about how not a single one of the rich ship owners, ship chandlers, or
wealthy bankers who ever asked for his help in defending against one legal
matter or another, was an Athenian citizen by birth<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It seems, then,
that most Athenian citizens had to figure out how to get by on their
&quot;political rights,&quot; and their land<b>. </b>So much had the ownership
of land become tied to the conception of Athenian citizenship, that, in 403
B.C., a law was actually introduced which, had it passed, would have limited the
privilege only to those who were landowners<b>. </b>This is why all those who

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It is
important to point out that, in Athens at least, every citizen had the right to
purchase as many slaves as he desired<b>. </b>There was, however, one very
important condition<b>: </b>he was obligated by law to teach them a trade<b>. </b>Compliance
with this condition required the expenditure of a sizable amount of money over and
above the original purchase price<b>. </b>To ensure compliance, there were some very
stringent laws in place that provided for punishment and fines for those who
kept an unemployed slave (<i>thoúlon argón</i>)<b>. </b>We remember the
example of Xenophánes [the philosopher of Magna Graecia] who, when asked by
Hiéron [the tyrant of Syracuse] to tell him how many slaves he owned, replied<b>:</b>
&quot;Two, and I am struggling to keep them fed.&quot;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">From
the above we can safely conclude that this form of &quot;rudimentary
adoption&quot; required a certain degree of financial capability, not only for
the day-to-day upkeep, but for the long term expenses as well<b>. </b>A
financial capability that may well have been within the reach of a middle class
citizen as far as the original purchase price was concerned, but over the years,
with the ever-increasing competition from the metics and the freed slaves,
together with the reduction of the value of land caused by pillage and
interminable wars, this capability was constricted more and more<b>.</b> To the
point, in many instances, where the citizen-owner was forced to either rent out
his slaves, allow them to set up on their own in order to reduce his costs, or,
as a last resort, manumit them<b>.</b> Should one wonder just what kind of
advantages a citizen-owner could expect from manumitting a slave, we can think
of two that come immediately to mind<b>: </b>1) his expenses were reduced because
he was no longer responsible for the slave's care and feeding, and 2) he
received
a significant sum of money in the form of either a lump sum payment or a steady income
over time, as consideration for granting the slave's freedom<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">The
process of manumission is executed either by the slave himself, or by an agent
hired by the slave to negotiate and/or make payment to his master, thereby
attaining his freedom<b>. </b>In most city-states, the ceremony of freeing a
slave was performed according to traditional formulaic rituals, either in front
of or inside a temple<b>. </b>The record of the procedure was then inscribed
upon an interior wall of the temple for future reference<b>. </b>In Athens,
however, the whole process was usually carried out in the law court or at the
theater, by the making of a verbal or written proclamation stating the name of
the slave about to be manumitted<b>. </b>The freeborn citizen had another
advantage, which was that should the manumitted slave die without heirs, his or
her estate would revert back to the former master<b>. </b>The manumission of a
slave without some form of monetary or other consideration was a very rare thing
indeed<b>. </b>Therefore, we can conclude that in order to purchase their
freedom under the conditions imposed by custom and law, slaves had to have some
means of obtaining a steady income<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let
us return now to the vocations which -- for the most part -- separated the
freeborn citizens from the slaves<b>.</b> We do this to bolster our argument
that the citizens were deeply and emotionally attached to the land, and were
struggling hard to keep it, because they had lost ground in all other areas of
the economy to the metics and freed slaves<b>.</b> Therefore, the possession of land was,
either by custom or law, the essence and source of their right to proudly claim
the title of freeborn citizens<b>. </b>To make our point, we submit the
following facts about the situation existing in the agricultural areas of
Greece.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In
the 5th century B.C., there were no slaves in Central Greece [within which lies
the &quot;breadbasket&quot; of the country]<b>. </b>In Plátaea [a city in
southern Boeotía], in 431 B.C., the city was unable to muster a contingent of
110 female slaves<b>. </b>By the 4th century, slaves in Boeotía comprised 1/3rd
of the total population<b>. </b>In Locris and Phocis [both in Central Greece],
slavery was virtually unknown prior to the Persian attack in 480 B.C<b>. </b>And
in Attica [the province within which Athens is located], not a purely agrarian
area, the number of slaves working the land was minimal<b>. </b>Among a
group of convicted lawbreakers in 451 B.C., whose estates had been forfeit and
sold at auction, only one owned 16 slaves<b>:</b> a metic from Piraeus, whose
offense was to violate the law forbidding him to own land<b>. </b>All of the
rest, whose land and crops -- either standing in the fields or already harvested
and in warehouses -- had no more than one or two slaves<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In a
catalogue of 131 manumitted [Athenian] slaves, not one of the 62 women mentioned
had worked on a farm prior to being freed<b>. </b>Of the 69 men, there are only
7 who worked on the land as gardeners, and 2 who worked in the vineyards<b>. </b>On
the other hand, in those areas that were more inclined toward commerce or light
industry, slaves not only made up the majority, but outnumbered even the metics
and the freeborn citizens<b>. </b>So that in 309 B.C., after the census of
Demetrius of Phálerum, we get the following results<b>: </b>freeborn citizens,
21,000<b>; </b>metics, 10,000<b>; </b>slaves, 400,000<b>. </b>On the island of
Aégina [in the Saronic Gulf, near Athens], the number of slaves approached
460,000 souls, whereas in Corinth 470,000<b>. </b>And on the island of Chios [in
the Northern Aegean], there were many more than on Aégina or in Corinth, though
we don't have precise figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let
us look now at the salaries paid to slaves and freeborn<b>. </b>In 325 B.C., the
9 archons of Athens [the chief magistrates and office holders of the State],
were each paid 4 obols a day, while, during the same period, the State paid
skilled slave craftsmen at the rate of 3 obols per day, plus meals<b>. </b>In
325, members of parliament [<i>voulé</i>], received 5 obols per day, whereas
jurors [<i>heliaiastés</i>] got 3<b>. </b>We take note, therefore, that in the
4th century B.C., a slave received an equal salary with a freeborn juror, and a
slightly lower salary than a magistrate or a member of parliament<b>. </b>Any
comparison with more modern times regarding this issue is sure to leave us with
many questions pertaining to the definition of the word &quot;slave,&quot; then
and now <font size="1">(1).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">We
further take note that in 400 B.C., a family of 3, together with their 2 slaves,
had a yearly expenditure of 1000 drachmas, whereas, in 370 B.C., the young
Demósthenes, with his mother and sister, and with no slaves, needed 700
drachmas per year<b>. </b>When we factor in an estimate of the increase in the
cost of living which took place in the intervening<b> </b>30 years, we find that
the slaves -- in both periods -- averaged a daily salary of about 3 obols, which
was naturally paid them by their owner<b>. </b>This applied to leased slaves as
well, where the freeborn citizen was also required to provide food, lodging,
clothing, etc., for the slave during the term of the lease<b>. </b>So that we
have -- in the 4th century B.C. -- domestic, leased, and publicly owned slaves
earning a steady and secure wage amounting to about 3 obols per day<b>. </b>If
we add in the cost of clothing, feeding, and housing, we see that their
actual salaries amounted to even more.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">From
Aristóphanes' great comedy, <i>&quot;Plútus&quot; </i>[&quot;Wealth&quot;],
performed in 380 B.C., we learn that shoes cost 8 drachmas and himations <font size="1">(2)</font>
cost 20<b>. </b>In 330 B.C., shoes for slaves cost 6 drachmas, and the chiton <font size="1">(3)
</font>worn by slaves cost as much as 7<b>. </b>We must also add the cost of
medical treatment for the slave, as well as the cost of teaching him a trade, as
was required by law<b>. </b>From all of the above, it is abundantly clear that
it was entirely possible -- if not probable -- that there would come a time when
a middle class Athenian citizen with a low income, who wished to maintain a
slave in accordance with law and custom, ran a real risk of dropping
precipitously to the status of the &quot;newly poor,&quot; because in order to
do so he would probably have to mortgage his land, in which case he ran the risk
of losing both his land and his most prized possession of all<b>: </b>that of
citizen of Athens, as we've already seen happen after the defeat of Athens in
the Lamian War of 322 B.C. As a result, we see that year after year there are
more and more slaves manumitted by an ever greater number of middle class
Athenian citizens<b>. </b>Either that, or they were subjugated to the State, metics,
or wealthy Athenians who could afford them<b>.</b> They were also leased out to
commercial or small industrial interests at an ever increasing rate<b>. </b>It
is during this period that the slave essentially becomes strictly a household
servant of the wealthier families of Athens<b>. </b>Actually, things have not
changed that much down through the centuries<b>:</b> The main differences being that the Athenian slave had much better future possibilities, more
respect, more rights, and better [weighted] monetary compensation than the serfs
of the Middle Ages and Czarist Russia, the slaves of the ante-bellum American
South, or the &quot;wage slaves&quot; of more recent times.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let
us turn now to the much-heralded and much-bemoaned slaves who worked in the
mines of Laúrium<b> </b><font size="1">(4)<b>. </b></font>The importance of
these mines (right through to about 370 B.C.) was negligible after the revolt of the
metal-working slaves which took place during the last few years of the Peloponnesian
War<b>. </b>In all of that time, right from the end of the war in 404 B.C.,
no major Athenian venture capitalist saw fit to invest in these mines<b>. </b>Add
to this the fact that only a small number of poor Athenian citizens worked there
for their own benefit -- which indicates to us that production had fallen a
great deal -- and we can understand why there was a crisis at the mines at this
time, and why the whole operation was in a very bad state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">When
considering that the majority of the slaves working in the mines were leased,
that the freeborn mine operators were paying a minimum of 1 obol per day to their
masters, and that they had the further expense of clothing and feeding their
charges -- in addition to which they had to contend with a general economic
depression in the Athenian economy due to Athens' defeat in the aforementioned
war -- we can see why the wages of the slaves at Laúrium were not up to par<b>.
</b>We then come to realize that the revolt was not due to any ill-treatment of
the slaves, but was most likely the result of the slaves coming to the
conclusion that, considering the arduous labor involved, working in the metal mines was not a profitable enough
occupation<b>. </b>This realization is
strengthened by the later indifference on the part of the venture capitalists to
continue operations in Laúrium, which allowed the poor citizens of Athens to
come in and try to scratch out a living<b>. </b>It is not until 367 B.C. that
activity at the mines is revived, only to peak at around 350 B.C., after which
time there is a steady decline<b>. </b>All of which begs the question<b>: </b>Why
weren't there any revolts during the many years that the mines were productive
under Athenian hegemony? The answer is simple<b>: </b>it was because during this
period the slaves were content and satisfied.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">As
regards the laws governing the rights of the slaves, we can add the following<b>:
</b>Slaves could appear as plaintiffs in an action against their masters who
were forced to appear to defend themselves<b>. </b>They had the legal right, as
previously mentioned, to have their own money<b>. </b>However, although they were not
subject to
monetary fines when they broke certain laws, they could suffer corporal
punishment instead<b>. </b>In Athens, a slave's master did not have the right to
take his life<b>.</b> A slave who suffered abuse and who sought sanctuary had
the right to be sold to another master<b>. </b>For these and other reasons we
read the following lines in the <i>Hecuba </i>by Euripides<b>: </b><i>&quot;For
you Greeks, both the free man and slave are protected by the same laws governing
homicide.&quot;</i> What is important here is that old Queen Hecuba is not talking about
Athenians only, but of all Greeks, which tends to indicate that there was a
common, pan-Hellenic code of behavior toward slaves in place at that time<b>. </b>Also,
an Athenian who murders his slave is ostracized from the city, a fate considered to
be worse than the death penalty<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">To
continue with the rights that a slave enjoyed, we see that there were no
restrictions which told him how to dress<b>;</b> as a result, he looked
no different from a freeborn Athenian working man on the street or in the agora<b>. </b>He could speak freely
on any subject, sometimes even verbally abusing his listeners, as anyone who has
read Greek comedy can verify<b>. </b>The Athenians and all Greeks relied upon their slaves
to fulfill the important role of teachers [<i>paidagogós</i>] to their children<b>.
</b>Demosthenes, in his <i>Against Meidias</i>, talks about a law which refers
anyone who<i> &quot;corrupts the morals of a child, woman, freeborn man, or
slave by committing an illegal act against their person&quot; </i>to the
Assembly [<i>Heliaia</i>] for trial<b>. </b>Demosthenes goes on to say<b>: </b><i>&quot;You
have all heard, O Athenians, how philanthropic is the spirit of that law, which
protects even the slave.&quot; </i>From Demosthenes we also learn that slaves
were protected by and subject to the Athenian laws governing commerce<b>. </b>They
had the right to be captains of [merchant] ships, to represent their masters as
agents in the&nbsp; foreign ports they visited, and to appear as litigants in the
courts of law in which cases having to do with commerce were heard<b>. </b>As
far as income is concerned, we have some pretty startling examples of just how
adept some were at accumulating wealth, such as in the case of Demetrius of
Phálerum's cook, who earned enough money in two years to buy three houses<b>.</b></p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let
us inquire now as to the condition of the slaves in Sparta, where they were
called helots [<i>éilótes</i>]<b>. </b>There, as opposed to the rest of
Greece, the helots were strongly tied to the land<b>.</b> This situation is
explained by the fact that in Sparta power
was entirely vested in the government, and not in the people [<i>démos</i>] as
it was elsewhere in Greece<b>. </b>Spartan
citizens were outnumbered ten to one by the helots, who were in essence the
property of the State<b>.</b> The citizens had the services of the helots who
were assigned to
them by the State and who farmed the land as sharecroppers,
but they had no right to either free them, or to increase or decrease the yearly
portion that the helots were obliged to give to them<b>. </b>The size of this portion was
determined by the Spartan State, and was usually about 70 bushels [<i>médimni</i>]
of barley for every Spartan (this increased when he married)<b>. </b>70 bushels came
to approximately 60 hundred-liters in weight, with an equivalent amount of wine,
and 30 hundred-liters of olive oil additionally assessed<b>. </b>This state-imposed ordinance had a
stabilizing effect upon Sparta, since it allowed its citizen-soldiers to
concentrate on their most important duty, which was the defense of their country<b>.</b>
In order to properly fulfill this duty they were expected to
turn away from all other cares, demands, and pleasures of life.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">At
this point, it is important to emphasize that these levies had been enacted by
the State during a year when the harvests were particularly small<b>. </b>The
result, of course, was that when the yields were above average or even just
average, the excess did not go to the Spartan master, who could expect only that
portion of the harvest due him by law, but to the helot and his family<b>. </b>This
situation could sometimes put the helot into the category of an independent
farmer, and not just a subsistence sharecropper<b>. </b>To this we must add
that when booty was acquired on campaigns in which the helots took part, any
plunder taken by a helot was his to
keep,<b> </b>which meant that it was also his to sell<b>. </b>In this way, and
under this system -- where the yearly income of the citizens was fixed and
unchanging -- there was created in Laconía a society where the masters grew
steadily poorer, while the helots, year by year, increased their wealth<b>.
</b>As further proof of this, we offer the following<b>: </b>When Cleoménes,
the king of Sparta, needed to raise money for the State, his proposal that this be done
by giving the helots the right to purchase their freedom was adopted by the
Ephors [Magistrates]<b>. </b>6000 helots took advantage of this opportunity and
the sum which accrued to the benefit of the Spartan treasury amounted to a total
of 500 talents<b>. </b>In other words, 6000 helots were in a
financial position to pay over the sum of 5 silver minás [<i>mnéa</i>]<i> </i>apiece for
their freedom<b>: </b>a very respectable sum in those days, and indicative of
their financial independence <font size="1">(5) </font>.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">It
must also not escape our attention that all of the contemporary criticism
regarding the conditions under which the helots lived never seem to compare
these conditions with the ones under which the Spartan citizen himself had to
live<b>. </b>To demonstrate, in other words, how the citizen was treated by the
State in comparison to how the helot was treated<b>. </b>If one were to compare
these two entities within the framework of&nbsp; Spartan society, one would soon
come to realize that whether it be in the military, the economic, or the
political realm of Spartan life, the laws under which the citizen-soldier lived
were harsher by far than those governing the helot<b>. </b>This because, as
previously mentioned, the helot was considered to be the property of the State,
and no Spartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy him, just as no
Spartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy any other State property<b>. </b>Only
the Spartan military government could determine a helot's punishment, and never
a private citizen.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">We
will now enquire into the &quot;krypteia,&quot; because the truth needs to be
told about this much-misunderstood institution of Spartan life as well<b>. </b>We
see the word krypteia, and learn about what it means for the first time, from
the great Lacedaemonian lawgiver, Lycurgus<b>. </b>It was designed to teach
young Spartans how to steal food so as to be able to survive under harsh wartime
conditions <font size="1">(6)</font><b>. </b>It was, therefore, part of their
training which, in addition to their barely adequate &quot;Spartan&quot; diet <font size="1">(7)</font>,
inspired them to devise impromptu food-gathering survival skills that would be of life-saving value to them in the years to come<b>. </b>In spite of this,
however, should the Spartan youth be discovered and caught, he was whipped and
put on reduced rations<b>. </b>It was Plato who made this law, given to the
Spartans by Lycurgus, well known among the Greeks<b>. </b>And, much later, it
would be Aristotle who made the law of krypteia synonymous with the training of
young Spartans to stealthily murder those helots thought to be a threat against
the Spartan State<b>. </b>In truth, the helots were anything but a threat to
Sparta.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Let
us see now just who these helots actually were<b>. </b>The [Greek] geographer,
Strabo, tells us (G.35) that the first capitulation of the Laconians to the
Dorians came about as a result of a treaty which granted the former equality and
a measure of civil rights<b>. </b>However, at around 1000 B.C., under the rule
of Agis, the son of Euresthénes, this treaty was violated<b>. </b>The result
was an uprising by the inhabitants of the territory of Helos, after which, when
the Spartans had put down the revolt, the name helots gained currency and came
to mean those descendants of the original inhabitants of the country<b>. </b>From
that time forward, the helots became part of the almost totally peaceful and
harmonious population, all of whom came to be known as Lacedaemonians<b>. </b>The
helots served in the army and the navy<b>. </b>In the navy, they served as
rowers, and in the army as adjutants, porters, and even armed troops [hoplites]<b>.
</b>Should a helot distinguish himself in battle, he would be given his freedom
and be graduated to higher category<b>; </b>that of a <i>neodamódon </i>[newly-enfranchised
citizen] as a reward for his bravery<b>. </b>Another category was that of <i>móthones</i>,
who were the children of a helot mother and a Spartan father<b>. </b>These
children were brought up as foster brothers and sisters of the Spartans, and
both sexes received the same training and upbringing as any other Spartan child<b>.
</b>They could, in time, attain full Spartan citizenship, which brought with it
all the rights, privileges, and obligations of a full-fledged Spartan.</p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Which
brings us to ask the following<b>: </b>How is it that these so-called
&quot;enemies&quot; of Sparta were able to receive Spartan military training,
and even allowed to bear arms during wartime? And why, since the helots so
outnumbered their &quot;masters,&quot; the ratio in war being in excess of 7 to
1, weren't the Spartans afraid that the helots would turn on them or desert to
the enemy?&nbsp; In spite of many opportunities to do so, there is not one
instance of desertion by helots during a battle to be found in the ancient
sources<b>. </b>On the contrary, at the battle of Thermopylae, the helots chose
to die to the last man instead of deserting to the Persians, as the Thebans did<b>.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Going
back to the Spartans and the helots, we will refer now to a third class of
inhabitants of Lacedaemonia<b>; </b>the <i>perioíkoi </i>[literally,
&quot;dwellers around&quot;]<b>. </b>These &quot;neighboring peoples&quot; <font size="1">(8)
</font>had won the right to claim the lion's share during the first land
distribution lottery instituted by Lycurgus<b>. </b>From the 39,000 <i>klérous </i>[lottery
tickets] distributed, the <i>perioíkoi </i>received 30,000 and the Spartans
only 9000<b>. </b>Another fact which exposes the lie about how unfair the
Spartans were, and how they oppressed the rights of all who were not pure-born
citizens of Sparta<b>. </b>Equality in the joys and pleasures of life was the
rule, but no equality existed when it came to the duties and obligations of a
Spartan<b>: </b>Such things fell to him alone within the purview of the Spartan way of
life, and its harsh ethic of military greatness<b>.</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">Closing
now with our references to Sparta, we remember the words of Archidámus, one of
Sparta's great kings, as recorded by the historian Thucydides<b>: </b><i>&quot;There
are no differences between one man and another, only the superiority that one
achieves who has been trained in the hardest school.&quot;</i></p>

Slavery in Thessaly, Crete, and other parts of Greece</b></p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">There
were slaves in other parts of Greece besides Athens and Sparta<b>. </b>In Thessaly, they
were called <i>penéstai </i>and <i>thettaloikétai; </i>in Sicyon, <i>korinophóroi;
</i>in Argos, <i>gymnítai;</i> in Crete, <i>klarótai, mnoítai, afamiótai,
thóloi, </i>and <i>oíkeis,</i> and in Locris, <i>oikiátai. </i>Corinth's
tyrant Periánder, the son of Cypsélus, banned the purchase of new slaves in a
measure designed to help the <i>thétes</i> <font size="1">(9)</font>,
most of whom were unemployed and starving<b>.</b> Aristotle tells us he did this
because he wanted &quot;even the mediocre to prosper,&quot; so as not to think
about wanting to have a say in running [or overturning?] the government<b>. </b>In
Thessaly, the <i> penéstai</i> were landowners and homeowners<b>. </b>They could have a family, worked wherever they
wished, and were free to carry weapons<b>. </b>Under such conditions, it should
come as no surprise that some acquired more wealth than their masters.</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">In
Crete, conditions were even more liberal<b>. </b>From the great &quot;Gortyn
Inscription,&quot; discovered in 1884 near the modern-day village of Aghoi Déka
in the South Central part of the island, we learn much relating to how the
institution of slavery was viewed in ancient Crete<b>. </b>Noteworthy is the
fact that fully 1/3 of the text -- referred to as the &quot;Code of Gortyn,&quot;
-- has to do with slavery<b>. </b>Slaves had the right to acquire property<b>; </b>meaning,
of course, that they could accumulate and possess wealth<b>. </b>They were
required to pay fines<b>; </b>which meant that they had the right to possess not
only real estate, but personal property as well<b>. </b>From the historian
Ephorus <font size="1">(10)</font>, we learn that the <i>klarótes </i>were
personal slaves who were intimately involved in the lives of their masters<b>. </b>In
Kydonía, there were special festivals and holidays set aside exclusively for
the slaves<b>.</b> During the celebration of these festivals, the slaves had the right to
&quot;beat&quot; freeborn Cretans.<b> </b>... Callistratus [4th century B.C. orator] tells us that the
Cretans, in order to avoid saying the word &quot;servant&quot; (which had a slightly
negative connotation, just as it does today), would refer to their domestics as <i>mnoítai,
</i>thereby hinting that they were the descendants of King Mínos himself <font size="1">(11)<b>.&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">There
is much more that could be said about the rights, duties, and conditions of life
of the slaves in the ancient Greek world<b>. </b>Surely, this study does not
come anywhere near exhausting the subject, and simply &quot;scratches the
surface,&quot; so to speak<b>. </b>There are, of course, omissions and
differences of opinions concerning this topic which have not been addressed<b>. </b>The
attempt was to present this important
subject in an objective and serious manner, and<b> </b>to do so within the framework
of the socio-political and economic conditions which were prevalent at the time,
thereby avoiding the distortions and politically correct interpretations
inspired by present-day attitudes and fashions<b>. </b>To examine the facts, and to avoid
falling into the pitfall of catering to the current &quot;-isms&quot; which are
directed more by self-interest than by a scholarly search for the truth<b>. </b>To
demonstrate that the role of the slave was different than that of the free
citizen, but not necessarily inferior, without degrading or romanticizing either
one<b>. </b>To show, in other words, as much as is possible in a quick study,
just what the words &quot;slave,&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; meant to the
ancient Greeks. The
Hellenic race deserves and demands to know the truth regarding its history,
because it has been subjected to historical distortions and outright lies long
enough.</p>

locals should they ever find themselves in enemy territory<b>. </b>These skills are taught
as part of a series of &quot;Field Expediency&quot; courses taught to all troops<b>.

multiculturalist proponents of &quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;human

a fuss about this as they make about the &quot;krypteia&quot; of Sparta?<b> </b>As
