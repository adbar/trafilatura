            on Affiliated Societies</h4>
           <p class="phdfont"> At its January 2002 meeting, the AHA Council accepted&#8212;on the 
            recommendation of the Committee on Affiliated Societies&#8212;the 
            German Historical Institute&#8217;s application for affiliation. During 
            the year the committee recommended two new organizations for affiliations. 
            The first was the Society of Automotive Historians (SAH), a society 
            that encourages research, documentation, preservation, and publication 
            of history concerning the invention, development, and influence of 
            the automobile. Founded in 1969, the SAH foster connections and cooperation 
            through meetings, a membership directory, bimonthly newsletters, and 
            a semi-annual scholarly journal, Automotive History Review. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The second was the Center for History and New Media (CHNM), located 
            at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. Since 1994, the Center 
            combines innovative digital media with the latest and best historical 
            scholarship to promote an understanding of the past as well as broad 
            historical literacy. As an online source for a variety of teaching 
            and professional aids, CHNM is a useful resource for history teachers 
            of any level, with links to 1,200 international history departments; 
            an indexed guide to 5,000 history web sites; an annotated guide to 
            500 U.S. history sites; a comprehensive directory of 2,000 web site 
            in the history of science and technology; and free software tools 
            useful for historians and teachers. At its January 2003 meeting during 
            the annual meeting in Chicago, Council accepted both organizations 
            as the 113th and 114th affiliated societies. (They will, therefore, 
            be included in the list of affiliated societies that will appear in 
            the annual report for 2003.) </p><p class="phdfont">
            A meeting for affiliated societies was convened by the committee at 
            the annual meeting to discuss relations between the AHA and the societies. 
            The attending societies asserted that affiliation with the AHA was 
            beneficial to everyone involved. </p>

            <hr><a name="cgs"></a><h4> Committee on Graduate Students</h4>
            <p class="phdfont">
            The transformation (in January 2002) of the Task Force on Graduate 
            Education into a standing committee&#8212;the AHA Committee for Graduate 
            Students [CGS]&#8212;represented a striking recognition of the fact 
            that graduate students can be more than mere apprentices in the governance 
            of the AHA. </p><p class="phdfont">
            Perhaps the most important task that the CGS accomplished in recent 
            months was to establish direct lines of communication&#8212;through 
            e-mail messages and surveys&#8212;with graduate student members of 
            the AHA.</p><p class="phdfont">
            In addition, the CGS continued the task force practice of organizing 
            sessions at AHA annual meetings based on suggestions directly received 
            from graduate students who attend the Graduate Student Forum at the 
            preceding annual meeting. CGS also sponsored an unprecedented number 
            of five sessions at the 2003 annual meeting. These included &#8220;Careers 
            in History&#8221; on the discussion of nonacademic careers and a &#8220;Nuts 
            and Bolts&#8221; workshop on preparing for and participating in the 
            job market. </p><p class="phdfont">
            Particularly through our liaison, Fiona Galvin, the CGS has energetically 
            collaborated with the AHA&#8217;s Committee on Graduate Education 
            (CGE), the body charged with carrying out the first national survey 
            of graduate programs in history since 1959. We also successfully encouraged 
            participation of graduate students in the CGE&#8217;s site visits 
            to programs across the country, arguing that graduate students were 
            uniquely qualified to interview and collect anecdotal data from other 
            graduate students. </p><p class="phdfont">
            As key members of the AHA, graduate students need to and will continue 
            to play a central role in shaping the debates and direction of the 
            profession today in ways that will ensure its advance along increasingly 
            equitable lines.</p>

            <a name="ciha"></a><h4>Committee on 
            International Historical Activities</h4>
            <p class="phdfont">During 2002 the AHA&#8217;s Committee on International Historical 
            Activities actively worked with the bureau of the International Congress 
            of Historical Sciences (ICHS, also often referred to, by the abbreviation 
            from the French, as CISH) toward organizing the 20th International 
            Congress to be held July 3&#8211;9, 2005, in Sydney, Australia. Dane 
            Kennedy and Arnita Jones participated on behalf of the AHA in the 
            General Assembly of the ICHS held September 2&#8211;3, 2002, at Amsterdam 
            and also attended a symposium there on the theme, &#8220;Presenting 
            the Nation: Can It Be Done?&#8221; </p><p class="phdfont">
            The AHA committee, having invited proposals from members interested 
            in participating as organizers, presenters, or discussants in the 
            congress, forwarded to the bureau of ICHS over 60 panel proposals 
            and 17 nominations for session organizers and discussants.</p>

            <hr> <a name="comh"></a><h4>Committee on Minority Historians</h4>
            <p class="phdfont">
            For the Committee on Minority Historians, 2002 was an especially productive 
            year . We completed the diversity series of pamphlets and began arrangements 
            to have some of the titles published online. We participated in two 
            major sessions&#8212;at the annual meetings of the Association for 
            the Study of Afro-American Life and History and the Organization of 
            American Historians. The committee not only contributed significantly 
            to the survey of the Committee on Graduate Education, but also conducted 
            its own survey of the minority members of the AHA. The aim of the 
            latter was to determine how the AHA can best serve this particular 
            constituency and to provide data to history departments and other 
            bodies to assist them in their efforts to recruit and retain minority 
            faculty, employees, and students. </p><p class="phdfont">
            At the 2003 annual meeting of the AHA, the committee organized&#8212;continuing 
            a tradition of establishing a presence at the annual meetings&#8212;a 
            session on the theme, &#8220;Increasing the Presence of Minority Graduate 
            Students in the Profession.&#8221; Also continuing a practice started 
            at the 2002 annual meeting, the committee organized a mentoring breakfast 
            at the 2003 meeting. At this resoundingly successful gathering, graduate 
            students were able to discuss professional concerns with senior faculty 
            members in an informal and relaxed setting.</p><p class="phdfont">
            The committee discussed at length a statement about recruitment and 
            retention of minority faculty, which had been issued by the Modern 
            Language Association&#8217;s Committee on the Literature of People 
            of Color in the United States and Canada. To facilitate broader discussion 
            of the document (with a view to issuing a similar statement), the 
            committee is publicizing the MLA committee&#8217;s statement. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The work of the committee was facilitated by the tireless efforts 
            of numerous people, but as the outgoing chair, I would like to especially 
            express my thanks to the members of the committee as well as to Noralee 
            Frankel, Arnita Jones, Cliff Jacobs, Peleg Tal, and other AHA staff 
            members.</p>

            The Joint Committee on 
            Part-Time and Adjunct Employment</h4><p class="phdfont">
            Concern about the increasing number of historians teaching as part-time 
            or adjunct faculty led to the creation of a permanent Joint OAH-AHA 
            Committee on Part-Time and Adjunct Employment in January 2002, whose 
            membership has consisted primarily of those who are, or who have in 
            the past, taught part-time. The rise in part-time and adjunct employment 
            is a serious, growing issue in the profession. The litany of problems 
            include abysmally low pay, often total lack of benefits (medical coverage 
            is frequently the most pressing need, but the lack of pension funds 
            has serious long range implications), ineligibility for grants or 
            travel money (to help with research that just might make escape possible), 
            poor or no office space or assistance, lack of computers (as technology 
            becomes ever more important), and sometimes no library access. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The problem is complicated by the fact that there are those who prefer 
            to teach part-time so that proposed solutions need to leave this possibility 
            open. This includes retired faculty still engaged with the discipline, 
            those with other full-time employment or family responsibilities, 
            as well as graduate students working to complete their degrees. There 
            are also small departments that can only offer a specialized course 
            with a part-time/adjunct employee. Another aspect of the issue is 
            the numerous institutions dealing with financial cuts by hiring a 
            large number of teachers at very low wages, who then try to survive 
            by piecing together jobs at several institutions. Solutions need to 
            go in two directions. One is to halt and reverse the bleeding of full-time 
            positions. The second is to make life better and fairer for those 
            who do teach part-time. The committee&#8217;s recommendations to the 
            OAH and AHA include provisions for a limit on the percentage of part-time 
            faculty in a department, for increased salaries (as a percentage of 
            what is paid to full-time faculty), benefits, office space, etc. Having 
            the recommendations accepted is just the first step. The harder task 
            ahead will be to convince those in control of the purse strings that 
            this is necessary. </p>

            The Committee on Women Historians</h4><p class="phdfont">
            The Committee on Women Historians &#8220;met&#8221; on the web between 
            October 23 and November 4, 2002, with all members participating. Our 
            discussions focused primarily on two issues: (1) the committee&#8217;s 
            survey of women members and (2) the status of the pamphlet series, 
            &#8220;Women&#8217;s and Gender History in Global Perspective.&#8221; 
            </p><p class="phdfont">
            The survey was sent to all post-PhD female AHA members last spring, 
            by e-mail; 361 replies were received. Members were asked to comment 
            on whether or not gender had, in their opinion or experience, been 
            a factor in their careers as historians. They were also asked to comment, 
            in an open-ended format, on what factors in particular aided or hindered 
            their advancement in the profession; whether mentoring had played 
            any role in their careers; and on anything else they wanted the committee 
            to know about their experiences as historians. Demographic data (year 
            of terminal degree, type of employment, rank, race/ethnic origin) 
            were also collected. Various members of the committee have been assessing 
            the data since it was received, with the assistance of Cliff Jacobs 
            of the AHA staff. The most significant findings cluster around issues 
            of collegiality and its assessment&#8212;which are difficult to document 
            and to correlate with women&#8217;s professional advancement. Other 
            findings center on women&#8217;s perceptions of ongoing gender discrimination 
            at all ranks of the professoriate. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The committee assessed the current status of the pamphlet series. 
            The AHA has signed a contract with the University of Illinois Press 
            for the publication of the pamphlets in volume form. Nearly all of 
            the contracted pamphlets have been received by the series editor Bonnie 
            Smith and reviewed by the committee. The committee was pleased to 
            see the pamphlets moving toward publication with a major press, and 
            grateful to the AHA staff and to Bonnie Smith for moving the process 
            along.</p><p class="phdfont">
            The committee discussed preparations for the 2004 annual meeting. 
            The committee also discussed its mission statement and the ongoing 
            work of the Task Force on Graduate Education. Virginia Sanchez-Korrol 
            was commended for her service to the committee. </p><p class="phdfont">
            I would like to take this opportunity to thank Noralee Frankel of 
            the AHA staff for her spirited, creative, and highly professional 
            work in support of the work of the CWH for the past three years (my 
            tenure as chair).</p>

            <h4>The Task Force on Public History</h4><p class="phdfont">
            Upon recommendation by the Professional Division, Council charged 
            the Task Force on Public History to identify ways the Association 
            can address the interests and concerns of public historians as well 
            as ways of deepening an understanding of and appreciation for the 
            activities of public historians within the profession. Our final report, 
            to be submitted to Council at the end of 2003, will include both a 
            substantive discussion of issues and recommendations pursuant to our 
            charge. </p><p class="phdfont">
            Two fundamental assumptions have governed our work to date. First, 
            public history is a responsibility of all historians. Public history 
            is not a subset of history, nor are public historians a subset of 
            historians. Second, public history and public historians are underserved 
            and underregarded by both the AHA and the profession, a situation 
            that needs redress. We also note a widespread interest in and greater 
            engagement with public history by the profession.</p><p class="phdfont">
            The task force has pursued its charge by reviewing the Statement on 
            Standards, identifying possible changes to the annual meeting, consulting 
            with the Committee on Graduate Education, considering public history 
            employment, and discussing collaborations with other history-related 
            organizations. We have also identified the need for advocacy for public 
            history at the state level. And to identify interests, needs, and 
            concerns related to public history and public historians, we conducted 
            two surveys: one of all AHA members and one of public historians. 
            We also conducted open forums at AHA&#8217;s 2002 and 2003 annual 
            meetings.</p><p class="phdfont">
            I conclude by acknowledging the creative thinking and hard work of 
            task force members, and the invaluable advice and support provided 
            by AHA staff, especially Arnita Jones and Debbie Ann Doyle.</p>

            <a name="tfip"></a><h4>The Task Force on Intellectual Property</h4><p class="phdfont">
            The TFIP &#8220;met&#8221; via e-mail as necessary, and at the Chicago 
            annual meeting. Our initial charge was to advise the Council on intellectual 
            property (IP) matters that might require Council action. Only one 
            such matter arose this year, as I will report below, but we have been 
            considering whether we should not attempt a project that might be 
            of considerable use and interest to the membership&#8212;a short guide 
            to copyright issues pertaining to historians. While there is by no 
            means universal agreement as to what the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright 
            Act (DMCA) means, we believe that we can lay out some general parameters. 
            We also propose to explore the possibility of preparing articles on 
            recent developments in intellectual property issues for publication 
            in Perspectives.</p><p class="phdfont">
            The Task Force had a very good discussion (through e-mail) of the 
            efforts begun by Larry Lessig (Stanford Univ. School of Law) to challenge 
            the recent Sonny Bono Term Extension Act, which added 20 years to 
            the life of copyrights. The ostensible rationale for the extension 
            was that the United States needed to conform to the new international 
            standard of 70 years for copyrights (at a time when the U.S. standard 
            was 50 years). The TFIP was unanimous in its view that the Bono Act 
            created bad policy for the work of historians, and recommended to 
            the Council that the AHA join the Association of Research Libraries&#8217; 
            amicus brief supporting the Lessig constitutional challenge to the 
            Bono Act in what has become known as the Eldred v. Ashcroft case. 
            We were subsequently solicited by a group preparing an amicus brief 
            speaking specifically for historians, but because we felt that we 
            should not sign two briefs, we did not recommend going forward with 
            the second. Lessig argued our position to the United States Supreme 
            Court this spring, and the Court will probably hand down its opinion 
            in the late spring of 2003. This may be an extremely important decision, 
            because the Act is being challenged on the grounds that the only constitutional 
            basis for copyright regulation is the promotion of creativity. A decision 
            in favor of the challenge would open the way to further litigation 
            against aspects of the DMCA, and might be extremely important to the 
            scholarly community.</p>

            <a name="pcb"></a><h4>The Pacific Coast Branch of the AHA</h4><p class="phdfont">
            The AHA Council, meeting in San Francisco in January 2002 endorsed 
            the revision of Article II of the constitution of the Pacific Coast 
            Branch (PCB) to clarify the purposes of the organization, specifically: 
            &#8220;The purposes of the organization shall be the advancement of 
            the interests of the American Historical Association, and the promotion 
            of the historical interests of the membership with special emphasis 
            on the United States, western Canada, Mexico, the Pacific Rim, and 
            their inter-relationships.&#8221;</p><p class="phdfont">
            At the 2002 annual meeting of the PCB, held in August at Tucson, nearly 
            150 individuals participated in 37 academic sessions. The program 
            also included two luncheon speakers&#8212;one sponsored by the Western 
            Association of Women Historians and another honoring the hundredth 
            anniversary of the PCB&#8212;and one banquet address by President 
            Thomas Alexander. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The following prizes were awarded during the year: the Louis Knott 
            Koontz Memorial Award for the most deserving article to appear in 
            the Pacific Historical Review in the volume year 2001 to Evan Ward 
            for his August 2001 article, &#8220;The Ghosts of William Walker: 
            Conquest of Land and Water as Central Themes in the History of the

            <a name="programcommittee"></a><h4>The 2002 Program Committee</h4><p class="phdfont">
            The 2002 Annual Meeting of the American Historical Association was, 
            thanks to the efficiency of the AHA staff, a smoothly run and very 
            successful event. A wide range of papers and an attendance beyond 
            what we might have expected in light of the events of September 11, 
            2001, attest to the continued relevance of the AHA to the profession. 
            </p><p class="phdfont">
            The 2002 Program Committee received 358 proposals for presentations 
            at the conference, of which we were able to accept only 157. Proposals 
            came not only from our local colleagues here in the United States, 
            but from Europe, Australasia, and elsewhere. Our theme&#8212;&#8220;Frontiers&#8221;&#8212;produced 
            a wonderful diversity of panels, and clearly spoke to the growing 
            interest in regional comparative studies. We received an unusually 
            high number of comparative proposals, and were able therefore to offer 
            many panels designed to draw people from a broader than usual range 
            of regional specialisms. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The topical breakdown of proposals received is as follows:</p><p class="phdfont">
            *Panels that are sponsored by various AHA bodies and thus guaranteed 
            a place on the program. These are included in the figures for the 
            &#8220;Accepted&#8221; column.</p><p class="phdfont">
            Our experience was an exhilarating and exciting one. The job of program 
            chair is an arduous one, though made considerably easier by the experience 
            and efficiency of the AHA staff. </p><p class="phdfont">
            We owe a tremendous debt to our Program Committee colleagues. We owe 
            our thanks also to Gabrielle Spiegel, vice president of the Research 
            Division, and Wm. Roger Louis, 2001 president, who were generously 
            supportive of our ideas and efforts. We are eternally in the debt 
            of Joe Wright, our extraordinarily gifted graduate assistant, and 
            we are grateful also to the AHA staff, most notably Sharon K. Tune, 
            Debbie Doyle, Vernon Horn, Robert Townsend, and Pillarisetti Sudhir.

            <h4>The 2003 Program Committee</h4><p class="phdfont">
            The 117th annual meeting of the American Historical Association held 
            in Chicago, January 2&#8211;5, 2003, was a huge success. The program 
            featured 168 panels that covered virtually every major historical 
            theme and topic, time period, and region of the world. Attendance 
            throughout was excellent, and most of the sessions, including those 
            held on Sunday, drew sizable audiences. </p><p class="phdfont">
            The 2003 Program Committee received only 203 proposals, a considerable 
            drop from the 2002 tally of more than 350 submissions. This noticeable 
            decline in submissions may have stemmed from a variety of reasons 
            such as cyclical fluctuations, the absence of a specific theme for 
            the meeting, and Chicago in January being less attractive than, say, 
            an East or West Coast locale. </p><p class="phdfont">
            Nevertheless, the Program Committee was extremely pleased with the 
            proposals it had to choose from and debated their pros and cons at 
            a meeting held April 19&#8211;21, 2002, in Washington, D.C. The following 
            is a breakdown of proposals received and accepted:</p><p class="phdfont">
            Based on my experience of serving on this year&#8217;s committee, 
            I have several observations to make that may be worth considering 
            in the future. As the subject distribution above reveals, we need 
            to continue to diversify and enhance the program. We probably should 
            be more proactive in soliciting panel proposals on Africa and the 
            ancient period because they are traditionally underrepresented year 
            after year. Although there were no panels that dealt exclusively with 
            Africa, five panels included coverage of it. I suspect submissions 
            relating to Asia, comparative, Middle East, world, and &#8220;other&#8221; 
            will continue to increase and take their place alongside the consistently 
            significant presence of American, European, and Latin American panels. 
            The mix of regions will also change from year-to-year as theme-centered 
            programs call for and encourage cross-regional comparisons. </p><p class="phdfont">
            Although several panels&#8212;especially those in the categories of 
            &#8220;pedagogy&#8221; and &#8220;other&#8221;&#8212;were included 
            in the program because they were sponsored submissions, it may be 
            worth noting that they would have found a place even on their own 
            merits.</p><p class="phdfont">
            A wonderful innovation for the 2003 meeting was the addition of six 
            presidential sessions that enriched the program by adding content 
            that may not have otherwise been well represented. Lynn Hunt, the 
            2002 president, consulted the Program Committee about her choice of 
            topics and panelists and judiciously scheduled the presidential sessions 
            to occupy key time slots on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. These 
            panels were a major highlight of the Chicago meeting. All the presentations 
            were first-rate and attendance at some of them ran into the hundreds. 
            </p><p class="phdfont">
            No Program Committee makes much headway without the heroic efforts 
            of the AHA staff&#8212;especially Sharon K. Tune and Debbie Doyle&#8212;in 
            facilitating the crucial Washington, D.C. meeting. Thanks are due 
            as well to Lynn Hunt, the AHA Council, the members of the committee 
            and, especially, to Lora Knight (Univ. of Utah), the committee&#8217;s 
            graduate student assistant.</p>
