        <h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reparations for the stolen 
          generations - Government responds </font></h2>
        <h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Speech delivered by the 
          Honorable Philip Ruddock, MP. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural 
          Affairs</font></h3>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
        Good afternoon Ladies and Gentlemen.</font> 
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">May I acknowledge 
          the traditional owners of this land, the Gadigal (Gad -e- gal) people, 
          of the Eora (Ee-or-a) nation</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I understand very 
          well that the subject of this Conference raises again the hurt and trauma 
          of the past and that this is difficult for all of us.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I do know that 
          there are many different views about these issues and I know that what 
          I am about to say will not be appealing to all.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Having said that, 
          I thank the organisers for the opportunity to put to you an honest explanation 
          of the government's position on these important matters.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Let me also say 
          that I think you have set yourselves an exceedingly ambitious task in 
          seeking to develop a model for reparations and, in particular, individual 
          financial compensation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The past practices 
          of child separation represent one of the most comprehensively and roundly 
          criticised chapters in Australia's history, regardless of how well intentioned 
          our predecessors (our parents and grandparents and their parents) might 
          have been.<br>
          The effects are still felt by a significant number of removed Aboriginal 
          children, their families and their communities.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The 1999 Parliamentary 
          Motion of Reconciliation provided a very genuine expression of deep 
          and sincere regret felt by most Australians.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>The Bringing 
          Them Home Report</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">I know that we 
          are not here today to discuss all of the recommendations of the <i>Bringing 
          Them Home</i> report. The question of reparations represents only a 
          subset of those recommendations</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And, as you know, 
          the idea of individual monetary compensation is itself only one aspect 
          of the reparations agenda proposed in the report.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Other forms of 
          reparations included acknowledgment and apology, guarantees against 
          repetition, measures of restitution and measures of rehabilitation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In its response 
          to the report the federal government embraced many of these proposals.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The national oral 
          history project and the Parliamentary motion of regret are nothing if 
          not an acknowledgment of and warning against repetition; the records 
          access, parenting, family reunion and tracing services are obvious forms 
          of restitution and, together with the network of counsellors, they also 
          constitute a program of rehabilitation for those affected.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In these and other 
          ways the federal government has already accepted the principle of reparation 
          as proposed by HREOC, of trying to make good the damage that has been 
          done.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Some commentators 
          are comparing our approach to that of other countries. May I replace 
          some fallacies with fact.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The South African 
          government has still not accepted the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 
          recommendations for a scheme of individual financial compensation<br>
          nor has the Canadian government adopted proposals for such a scheme 
          (although like us, it has funded family reunion, counselling and other 
          healing programs) and nobody in New Zealand has ever received individual 
          financial compensation as a result of the Waitangi Tribunal process.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Commonwealth 
          Response</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We have said, clearly 
          and consistently, that appropriate and practical steps should be taken 
          to address the hurt and trauma experienced by the separated children 
          and their families. In doing so we have focused in particular on family 
          reunion, the issue identified in Bringing Them Home as &quot;the most 
          significant and urgent needs of separated families&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And just a few 
          months ago the Commonwealth reaffirmed this commitment by extending 
          funding for the Link Up and related initiatives to bring the Commonwealth's 
          total contribution to $117 million.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><b>Compensation 
          and a Tribunal</b><br>
          The Commonwealth (and the States) did not, however, accept the recommendations 
          concerning individual monetary compensation and a national compensation 
          tribunal: first, monetary compensation to individuals is not seen as 
          the most appropriate way of dealing with family separation; second, 
          given the varied and largely undocumented circumstances of the individual 
          historical events in question, it would be impossible to devise and 
          apply any such scheme in a practical and equitable manner; and </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">third, 
          an alternative tribunal process does not avoid the trauma of revisiting 
          past events, nor does it by keep matters out of the hands of the legal 
          profession and the courts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Today I want to 
          focus on the feasibility of devising a practical and equitable scheme.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The first and most 
          fundamental question you need to consider is that of who you would and 
          who you would not compensate.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">For example, would 
          financial compensation be available to those children and families who 
          are subject to contemporary separation practices or only to those separated 
          in the past?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And if you are 
          talking only about the past, what would be your cut-off point?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Would you restrict 
          financial compensation only to the children themselves or would you 
          extend it to their families, descendants and communities (as recommended 
          by HREOC)?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If you decide that 
          the children, families and communities of the separated children would 
          not be eligible for compensation from the tribunal, then you are faced 
          with the prospect of much of the existing litigation continuing in the 
          courts.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But even if you 
          do decide to grant them eligibility for compensation, that raises another 
          set of questions: how do you define which family and community members 
          are eligible?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Do you take a culturally 
          appropriate broad definition of &quot;family&quot; and &quot;community&quot;?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One of the most 
          basic questions that a statutory compensation scheme would have to address 
          is that of defining and deciding the circumstances that warrant compensation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">You would need 
          to distinguish those cases where adoption or separation was voluntary 
          or involuntary but warranted from those where separation was both involuntary 
          and unwarranted the mere fact of childhood separation does not of itself 
          justify compensation.<br>
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          It has been said that a statutory scheme would be much simpler and therefore 
          less costly than a normal judicial process. However, a large proportion 
          of the costs of any such assessment in these cases is the difficulty 
          of researching and reliably reconstructing events so long after they 
          actually took place. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">This is very different 
          from reconstructing the circumstances of a recent crime as in a Victims 
          Compensation Tribunal. It is also very different from the Canadian situation 
          where at least everyone knows who was and who was not enrolled in their 
          residential schools.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">As your conference 
          papers themselves acknowledge &quot;&#133;questions about the validity 
          of individual acts of removal &#133; are enormously complex and variable..&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Locating relevant 
          documents and witnesses so long after the event would confront both 
          the claimants and the respondents before a tribunal, just the same as 
          if they were before a court.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">There are another 
          series of questions: how would you apportion the onus of proof, and 
          what would be the burden of proof, that is, to whom would you give the 
          benefit of the doubt?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And this would 
          also involve making a trade-off between the rigour of the decision-making 
          process and the eventual costs of any compensation scheme, the less 
          rigorous the process, the greater the ultimate costs of compensation, 
          </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">but the more 
          rigorous the process, the closer you get to the equivalent of a full-scale 
          judicial hearing.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">A further question 
          you need to consider is what avenues and grounds of appeal should be 
          allowable from decisions of a compensation tribunal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Then there is the 
          question of who would be responsible for paying the compensation, and 
          what would be the limits (if any) on the quantum of compensation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The answer to this 
          question - combined with the questions of how many children were actually 
          removed and how many of their family and community members would be 
          compensated - will directly impact on the overall cost of any such scheme.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In its submission 
          to the Senate Inquiry, for example, the Commonwealth estimated the total 
          potential cost of compensation as some $3.9 billion.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">If people wish 
          to argue that pursuit of such claims through the courts is too costly, 
          then they must also seriously examine the potential cost of any alternative 
          scheme</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The administrative 
          costs alone would be prohibitive if a tribunal were also to have an 
          investigative role and &quot;a full time presence at the local level&quot; 
          [as is being recommended in your conference papers].</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Whatever the quantum 
          of individual compensation, there is also the related question of who 
          would pay?</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">One option being 
          proposed is a national compensation fund to which all governments and 
          churches would contribute.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">In the first instance 
          the States and churches would have to agree on their relative contributions 
          to such a fund; and they would also have to agree, in effect, to a blank 
          cheque, in case the initial fund proved inadequate; and, in view of 
          that possibility, they would almost certainly require severe strictures 
          to be imposed on the design and operation of any compensation tribunal.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It would be more 
          realistic and more appropriate for the States and the churches to be 
          directly liable to compensate the children whom they removed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">What I have described 
          today are the sorts of questions that the Commonwealth encountered when 
          it examined the idea.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The alternative 
          of pursuing compensation through the courts is not without its problem, 
          as we all know.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">But a tribunal 
          process would not necessarily do away with the trauma of revisiting, 
          recounting and reliving past events</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And if it were 
          to have any credibility, a tribunal mechanism would still entail the 
          complex and costly process of reconstructing and verifying distant events. 
          Nor would it see an end to the litigation, since no one has proposed 
          that common law alternatives (or appeals) would be ruled out.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">It is the government's 
          view that any additional resources that might be used for compensation 
          should be channelled towards family reunion and related services.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And we are not 
          alone in that view. Not one State government has committed itself to 
          providing financial compensation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">Federal Labor is 
          the same. Indeed, the previous Federal Labor Government initiated the 
          defence of the Kruger and Bray constitutional challenge to the NT Aboriginals 
          Ordinance that was at the centre of the Cubillo and Gunner case. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The NSW Labor Government 
          defended the Williams case.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"> Premier Carr said, 
          &quot;I think we've got to move beyond the idea that we can do it by 
          making a cash payment to compensate for things that happened in our 
          past&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">And most recently 
          the Leader of the Opposition and the Shadow Minister have stopped talking 
          about a &quot;compensation tribunal&quot; (as they did until a few months 
          ago) and are now only promising a &quot;national conference&quot; to 
          discuss &quot;alternative means of resolving these matters&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1"><br>
          <b>The Way Forward</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">The real question 
          is how can we best redress the effects of past policies and practices? 
          This is a question not just for the Commonwealth, but for State and 
          Territory governments, the churches and the community as a whole.<br>
          I believe that the government's $117 million response to the <i>Bringing 
          Them Home</i> report is a substantial demonstration of our commitment 
          to assist those that have been affected by past practices.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">We do need to move 
          forward and, as a community, we need to make sure that we do all we 
          can to address the severe disadvantage that is faced by so many Indigenous 
          Australians today.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="-1">All of us need 
          to work hard to ensure a better life for future generations.</font></p>
