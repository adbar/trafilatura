      <a name="intro"></a> [<i>page 1</i>] DURING the last thirty years a new 
      educational development has been taking place—the growth of Residential 
      and non-Residential Colleges for adult students, or what is more generally 
      known as the Educational Settlement Movement. The idea of the Movement is 
      that of education in community and in it many people have found a deep and 
      abiding interest and concern. Because of its value and infection it is now 
      shared by a very much wider public than formerly. </p>
      <p>“The assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of 
      hate, the enlargement and instruction of men’s hearts and minds” are some 
      of the indispensable and urgent duties and services of our time and all 
      true citizens should be identified with them. For many, I feel sure, the 
      effective medium for the discharge of these duties and the fulfilment of 
      these services is to be found in the Movement with which this pamphlet is 
      concerned. </p>
      <p>ARNOLD S. ROWNTREE,<br>
      President of the Educational Settlements Association. <br>
      January 1938. </p>
      <h4><a name="community_education"></a>Community education</h4>
      <p>[<i>page 2</i>] The age in which we live has been described as the 
      golden age of applied science, the millennium of social facilities. The 
      development of industry, the amazing progress of scientific invention, and 
      the increasing dominance of the machine over life, both in work and in 
      leisure, have profoundly influenced the moral, spiritual and intellectual 
      attitude and outlook of all, and have reset the problem of human worth and 
      conduct. </p>
      <p>Universal elementary education, the flooding of new knowledge through 
      hitherto undreamt of channels, the demands upon attention and interest 
      through cinema, advertisement and daily Press, and the fascination of 
      speed and the desire to be on the move “, are factors which have gone 
      deeply into our lives and have made it imperative that we should take 
      serious stock of our situation if we are to preserve the unity of our 
      lives as individuals and as a people, let alone break new ground in the 
      experiment of living. </p>
      <p>The resistless spirit of man has driven him forth to discover the 
      utmost limits of the objective world—to sail its mighty oceans, climb its 
      highest peaks, sound its depths and mount its heavens, master its stubborn 
      resistance and exploit its material resources. The quest has been 
      unremitting, eager and thrilling, but it has not been concerned with what 
      matters most, namely, a true human motive, a sufficient “end” for all its 
      stupendous tasks and efforts. </p>
      <p>Indeed, what is coming to be seen with no small measure of alarm is 
      that “means” have been regarded as “ends “, that things have been thought 
      of as something worthy in themselves, and that human beings may be 
      sacrificed to them; that unless a worthy human purpose or use can be found 
      for them the opportunities and inventions of the scientific age may prove 
      delusive and destructive of man. </p>
      <p>Whilst man has been absorbed in the discovery of the remote countries 
      of the world he has neglected to press forward in the discovery of that 
      hidden country in the mind and spirit. There is so much of this <i>terra 
      incognita</i> lying undiscovered in ordinary men and women, and its 
      unveiling is so important both to us and to society at large, that the 
      penetration of it and becoming at home in it is one of the imperative 
      necessities of our time. </p>
      <p>“Who “, says Fuller, “hath sailed about the world of his own heart, 
      sounded each creek, surveyed each corner, but that there still remains 
      much <i>terra incognita</i> in himself?” It is the discovery of this terra 
      incognita that is civilization, and it is one of the functions [<i>page 3</i>] 
      of education to bring it about, not only in the exceptional person but in 
      the ninety and nine, in the ordinary everyday average man and woman. </p>
      <p>It is this service of discovery of the “inward man “, this search for a 
      true knowledge of ourselves, this reaching up to the full stature of 
      manhood and womanhood, this blending of the spiritual and the intellectual 
      in a unified personal life, this dedication to a worthy human ideal, that 
      is implied in the word “ education”, and that is our important business. 
      It cannot be imparted to children even by the best of teachers; it cannot 
      be given to adolescents; but it can and must be achieved by men and women 
      in fellowship of understanding and corporate dedication to the search for 
      true knowledge, in a united determination to serve the noblest conception 
      of life yet bequeathed to man. </p>
      <p>This Community Education is the purpose of the Educational Settlements 
      Association through its Residential Colleges and Educational Settlements.
      </p>
      <h4><a name="association"></a>The Association</h4>
      <p>The Association is a voluntary organization for adult education. It was 
      founded in 1920 and to-day comprises seven Residential Colleges and 
      twenty-nine Educational Settlements or non-Residential Colleges. For 
      directory, see pages 15 and 16. </p>
      <p><b>Status</b>. The Association is a Responsible Body under the Board of 
      Education Adult Education Regulations for the purpose of submitting formal 
      classes and receiving grants in respect of them. </p>
      <p><b>Finance and Management</b>. The Association is governed by a Council 
      composed in the main of representatives of the constituent institutions 
      affiliated to it. It is maintained from voluntary sources and for the 
      purposes outlined in this pamphlet administers funds entrusted to it by 
      Educational and other Trusts. </p>
      <p><b>Scholarships and Bursaries</b>. The Association awards annually a 
      limited number of bursaries to men and women wishing to proceed to one or 
      other of the Residential Colleges for a course of full-time study. Also 
      from time to time it awards travel bursaries for students. </p>
      <p><b>Affiliation</b>. Among the conditions of affiliation to the 
      Association are: (1) That the College or Settlement must have a Governing 
      Body and in the case of a Settlement a student membership which is 
      represented on the Governing Body. (2) That the education given must be 
      non-party in politics and non-sectarian in religion. </p>
      <p><b>Consultation and Advice</b>. The Association is a clearing house for 
      information concerning various aspects of Settlement [<i>page 4</i>] and 
      College work and of vacancies and opportunities arising in connection with 
      them. Interviews with prospective workers in the movement are arranged and 
      because of its extensive and varied experience the Association is 
      competent to give advice on questions relating to the kind of training and 
      initiation needed for it. </p>
      <p><b>Contact with the Wider Movement</b>. The Association keeps in 
      effective touch with its constituent bodies by representation on their 
      respective committees and councils, by the holding of regular meetings of 
      representatives and other members of Colleges and Settlements, by the 
      regular visitation by the Secretary and members of the Executive Committee 
      and by the arrangement of Conferences. </p>
      <p>Co-operation in the work of the wider movement of Adult Education is 
      effected by representation on such bodies as the Adult Education Committee 
      of the Board of Education, the Workers’ Educational Association, the 
      National Central Library, British Drama League, National Adult School 
      Union and other kindred organizations. </p>
      <p>The Association is responsible for the administrative and publicity 
      work of the Joint Committee for Residential Adult Education which was set 
      up to bring together the Residential Colleges and the Supplying Bodies in 
      Adult Education. This Committee is composed of representatives of the 
      University Extra-Mural Boards, the Trades Union Congress, the Central 
      Joint Advisory Committee on Tutorial Classes, the Workers’ Educational 
      Association, Association of Education Committees and the Residential 
      Colleges. </p>
      <p><b>Literature</b>. <i>The Common Room</i>—the journal of the 
      Association —is published three times yearly. The purpose of this journal 
      is for the interchange of news and opinions each term among all who are

      <h4><a name="residential_colleges"></a>The residential colleges</h4>
      <p>A body of students sharing a common life under a common roof with their 
      own tutors, their own lectures and classes, Residential their own library 
      and common room, their own societies for discussion and for sport and 
      recreation—the residential college is a unique and valuable feature of the 
      older English universities which is rarely found abroad, and is only 
      partially realized in the men’s and women’s hostels of the newer 
      universities in this country. </p>
      <p>To bring an opportunity for at least one year of continuous study under 
      such conditions to working men and women of adult years (the ages range 
      from nineteen to sixty, with an average between twenty-five and thirty is 
      the aim of the Residential Colleges for Workers which have sprung up 
      during the present century. </p>
      <p>There are now seven colleges of this type. The oldest is Ruskin 
      College, Oxford, founded. in 1899. The youngest is Newbattle Abbey, near 
      Edinburgh, founded a year ago. </p>
      <p>Ruskin College is open to both men and women students for either one 
      year or two years. Second-year students may enter for Diploma examinations 
      in the University of Oxford, and the lectures and libraries of the 
      University have been generously put at the disposal of the students. The 
      College is governed by representatives of the Trades Union Congress 
      General Council, and of other working-class organizations, together with 
      three University “advisers “. Students for the most part come by means of 
      scholarships or grants provided by Trade Unions, Educational Trusts, or 
      Local Education Authorities. </p>
      <p><a href="../../thinkers/bryan.htm">Fircroft College</a> at Bournville, Birmingham, was modelled on the Danish 
      Folk High School, and has the advantage of access to the lectures and 
      other facilities of Woodbrooke and the other Selly Oak Colleges. Avoncroft 
      College, near Bromsgrove, is specially designed for agricultural workers, 
      and combines cultural and vocational interests. Hillcroft College, 
      Surbiton, is the only working women’s college. Coleg Harlech is a Welsh 
      foundation, though not exclusively confined to Welsh students. All these 
      colleges are recognized for grant by the Board of Education, and are 
      affiliated to the Educational Settlements Association, in which they form 
      a Colleges Group. </p>
      <p>These colleges aim at providing selected adult students with the 
      opportunity of continuous study, unhindered by the many obstacles which 
      confront the worker-student living at home— [<i>page 6</i>] scanty or 
      scattered leisure, lack of privacy and quiet, and the pressure of private 
      engagements or public work. </p>
      <p>They present many advantages which the Tutorial Classes or the W.E.A. 
      course in a locality cannot give—regular weekly private tuition, 
      association with several tutors, a wide range of subjects, easy access to 
      books and guidance in reading, as well as the enrichment of intercourse 
      with fellow students of diverse occupations, from different parts of the 
      country, and sometimes from overseas. </p>
      <p>And what happens to students after they have left the colleges? In 
      earlier and more prosperous times the most of them would return to their 
      occupations and localities, there probably to engage in educational, 
      social, or political work among their fellows. But to-day there are many 
      who seek for new openings and callings,, either because they cannot find 
      work in their previous occupations, or because they are anxious to find 
      more congenial work. </p>
      <p>Among the students, for example, several have entered on fulltime 
      educational work with the W.E.A. or the Co-operative Movement, others have 
      been engaged as research officers in their trade unions, others elected to 
      Parliament, while not a few have qualified for special forms of social 
      service, such as probation work, and one or two are parsons. Recently, a 
      number have found a useful place as leaders in the Educational Settlements 
      and Community Centres that have sprung up in the Special Areas, or on new 
      housing estates. </p>
      <p>But the results of residential adult education are not to be measured 
      in terms of easily recorded after-careers, or achievements in public life; 
      the most significant results are the imponderable ones that take place in 
      the mind and spirit—the expansion of interest, the growth of character and 
      insight, the loosening of prejudices and strengthening of principles. </p>
      <p>The collection of students’ sayings in Learn and Live bears witness to 
      the fruits that may be, though they are not always, gathered from the life 
      at college. “He put my hand on a new latch,” says one student of his 
      tutor. And another says quite simply: “He introduced me to myself.” </p>
      <p>It would be difficult to find a better phrase to describe one of the 
      most important effects of college life. For, after all, there are many men 
      and women who have never really been introduced to themselves, or who are 
      not on good terms with, or at home with, themselves. The first effect of 
      self-acquaintance may not always be encouraging. We discover our 
      prejudices and our limitations of knowledge or capacity. But the 
      recognition of ignorance is, as Socrates maintained, the beginning of 
      wisdom; and the education which so begins may pass into the highest form 
      of education, which is the “conversation with a man’s best self “. And 
      this kind of self-knowledge and self-communion is bound up with a [<i>page 
      7</i>] better understanding of the other man and of the community in which 
      we live, so that the student who has come by it is like to be a better 
      parent, a better companion, and a better citizen. </p>
      <p>We do not seek nor expect perfection; we see frequent failures and 
      failings back; but all of us who are engaged in residential Adult 
      Education are encouraged to continue by the happy knowledge of men and 
      women whose lives have been enriched, if not transformed, by the gradual 
      process of growth in knowledge, wisdom, humour and good humour—of growth, 
      in fact, in grace. </p>
      <h4><a name="educational_settlements"></a>Educational Settlements 
      —Non-residential Colleges for Adult Education in normal areas</h4>
      <p>Any attempt to describe a Settlement in a normal area 
      must overcome the difficulty of definition: what is a Settlement and what is a normal area? For the purpose of this article a normal 
      area must be understood as an urban area, neither “special” nor “distressed “, with a fair provision of community services such as 
      health, technical and post-school education in general. ‘What a Settlement 
      is in such an area will, I hope, be clear by the time this article is 
      concluded. </p>
      <p>
      <img border="0" src="../../images/scenes/settlement_sports_south_wales.jpg" alt="picture: settlement sports day - south wales" align="right" hspace="10" width="370" height="259">It is always easy to say, first, what a thing is not, and therefore it 
      may be as well to say how a Settlement differs from both a W.E.A. tutorial 
      class and a local authority’s evening institute. W.E.A. tutorial classes 
      will be found in Settlements, and some Settlements are affiliated to 
      evening institutes. Moreover, some institutes, especially those provided 
      by the London County Council, are the equal in range and social life, and 
      mote than the equal in equipment, of the best of Settlements. Where is the 
      difference? </p>
      <p>As is generally known, the principle of the W.E.A. is to form a 
      tutorial or other class where the members of the class require it, in 
      church hail, school, settlement or working men’s club. By contrast the 
      Settlement houses a variety of activities in the one building. On the 
      other side, however vivid may be the social life of a London Literary 
      Institute, its programme, staffing and general control are in the hands of 
      a statutory authority: the principal, for example, cannot be dismissed by the students. In a 
      Settlement, however, it is possible for the individual student, with [<i>page 
      8</i>] his or her fellows, to have a preponderating share in the government of 
      the Settlement, to appoint the staff, to decide the educational and 
      general policy and generally, through an executive, to be responsible for 
      the detailed life of a community which may include as many as six or seven 
      hundred men and women. </p>
      <p>So much for definition by contrast. Now, what would you find on 
      entering a Settlement? Inside on the notice board there would be the 
      schedule of the day’s, or more generally the evening’s, activities. These 
      might include an economics class, folk dancing, a rehearsal for a Shaw 
      play, German literature and practical wireless construction. The number of activities is necessarily determined by the 
      size and adequacy of the premises. From the entrance hall it is usually 
      not far to the common room. This should be, and in most Settlements is, 
      truly a common room. It ceases to be one when rehearsals or committee 
      meetings are allowed to encroach. After classes are over the embryo 
      philosophers and folk dancers, economists and German scholars, together 
      with others not bent on any special activity, meet and talk there. A 
      canteen is provided, and tongues can wag, gently lubricated by tea, coffee 
      or lemonade, until 11 p.m., or whatever is the official closing time. A 
      library is housed either in the common room or elsewhere. For the rest, 
      the enquirer will find class rooms, a lecture hall and workshops, together 
      with, in many Settlements, the private rooms of the resident wardens. </p>
      <p>Much has been written of things so far. What is happening to persons. 
      here? Well, in the first case, there is space in the Settlement, colour 
      and light, and many who come there lack these in their homes. There is 
      freedom. In the Settlement the individual man or woman may become 
      significant. The man is no longer a lodger, tolerated by an inhospitable 
      landlady. The woman is no longer “merely a wife “—dare it be said?—surrounded by housework and the care of children. A good many young 
      parents take it in turn to come to the Settlement, in order that neither 
      shall be wholly tied. </p>
      <p>There is not only freedom; there is grace. You only achieve 
      significance by making yourself acceptable to your fellows. On first 
      joining the Settlement you may discover pain, the pain of contrast. 
      Settlements are not places to stave off revolution. But the discontent 
      stands a chance of becoming transformed through righteous indignation into 
      positive social effort by the fellowship of varied souls, whose experience may range from that of a county 
      court judge or city engineer to that of a coachbuilder or factory hand. 
      The intellectual discipline of the tutorial class is allowed to impress 
      the passive play-reader. Folk dances keep the earnest Marxist human, and 
      Christian and Atheist are able to meet together in a community which is 
      salted with humour. [<i>page 9</i>]</p>
      <p>Most of the work is done in the evening, but there is a considerable 
      and growing amount of work being done in the day with shift workers, 
      unemployed, and married women. It is not only classes which are organized. 
      In most Settlements there are strong dramatic groups; one has twice been 
      in the finals of the British Drama League for the whole of England. 
      Settlements have often taken a leading part in forming Youth Hostels, in 
      focusing public opinion on the school-leaving age, nursery schools and 
      other local government matters. </p>
      <p>All educational settlements are affiliated to the Educational 
      Settlements Association, which is a responsible body recognized by the 
      Board of Education. Classes submitted through the E.S.A. or the W.E.A. are 
      inspected by the Board’s inspectorate. In addition, many local authorities 
      give block grants to Settlements and a corresponding amount of 
      registration and inspection follows again. </p>
      <p>The majority of Settlements receive a grant from the E.S.A., ranging 
      from ten to thirty per cent, of the total income; the balance is made up 
      of students’ fees (in one Settlement these range from is. 6d. to 7s., 
      according to the class, and the year’s entire programme may be taken for a 
      composition fee of 12s. 6d.), grants in aid from the Board of Education 
      and the local authority, local subscriptions, and the special efforts, 
      such as garden parties, of the students themselves. </p>
      <p>The staff will vary from place to place. There is always a full-time 
      Warden or joint Wardens, with occasionally a sub-Warden. The remainder are 
      part-time tutors, taking their special subjects. They may be wholly 
      occupied with similar work, as are the majority of W.E.A. tutorial class 
      tutors, or they may be engaged on quite other work. There is in one 
      Settlement, for example, a Post Office official who conducts an English 
      literature class which has achieved renown. Many groups, especially those 
      which are not limited by statutory requirements, will be staffed and 
      organized by students themselves. </p>
      <p>Cardinal Newman once wrote: “If, then, a practical end must be assigned 
      to a university course, I say it is that of training good members of 
      society. Its art is the art of social life and its end is fitness for the 
      world.” The Settlement is concerned not only with the decent use of 
      leisure but with the very art of living, and the words of Newman may not 
      unjustly be adopted as its aim. </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p><i>&nbsp;“TheSettlements which have grown up in the mining valleys of South Wales since 1927 are making a contribution to the cultural and social life of the communities they serve which may fairly be described as unique inasmuch as they have been able to continue, in a way hardly open to any other type 
      of organisation, the provision of expert advisory services in a variety of 
      social activities with the maintenance of that close personal relationship 
      and concern for people in whose midst they are situated, which is the 
      distinguishing mark of Settlement work.”—Report of the Commissioner for 
      the Special Areas in England and Wales for the year ended September 30th, 
      1937. </i> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A number of palliative and practical efforts have been made in the 
      Special Areas in the hope of mitigating the severity and demoralization of 
      the conditions which poverty and uselessness have imposed upon many 
      thousands of homes. One of the most significant has been the establishment 
      of Educational Settlements of which there are eight in South Wales, one on 
      the north-east coast of County Durham, and one at Maryport in Cumberland.
      </p>
      <p>The first and obvious needs met by these efforts were physical. Visits 
      to the homes of some of the miners revealed the desperate struggle going 
      on, not only to feed the family, but in many cases also to hide the 
      poverty that had overtaken them. Steps were taken to meet such needs as 
      far as funds would allow. </p>
      <p>But if the physical condition was serious the mental condition was even 
      more serious, and there was as deep a need for an understanding sympathy 
      as for material help. </p>
      <p>In the situation we are thinking of the people had been used to work, 
      to a consuming occupation which demanded their physical strength and 
      occupied their minds, but after the General Strike many thousands of them 
      found themselves with nothing to do from morning to night, week in, week 
      out, and in place of a regular wage a meagre allowance from Public 
      Assistance. Next, therefore, to trying to meet the barest physical needs 
      was the imperative necessity [<i>page 11</i>] of something to meet the mental and spiritual demands of their lives, 
      and it was this which led to the first Settlement in South Wales. </p>
      <p>As an outcome of consultation with those who had experience of 
      Educational Settlements in normal areas a house, Maes-yr-Haf, was taken 
      and the experiment began of educating people to make good use of their 
      otherwise useless hours and days. </p>
      <p>At Maes-yr-Haf it was recognized from the outset that sympathy becomes 
      mere sentimentality unless it has a practical expression, and that the 
      spiritual life of a people is inseparably linked up with education in the 
      broadest sense of that word. Therefore an attempt was made to find work 
      for idle hands to do as well as to provide food for the mind. Cobblers’ 
      shops, equipped with the necessary tools and leather, where unemployed men 
      could mend boots and shoes for their dependants and also for school 
      children, were among the first and successful efforts. Later came the 
      development of men’s clubs in which meals were provided and pieces of 
      public work undertaken by unemployed men, by arrangement with the local 
      authorities. The clubs had workshops and tools where men could learn to 
      make simple furniture and mend their own household necessities. Skilled 
      instructors were available, and at one time there were as many as forty 
      such centres in different parts of the South Wales valleys. </p>
      <p>The starting of Adult Schools, and informal classes in a variety of 
      subjects, and of a little school of weaving for women and girls at the 
      Maes-yr-Haf Settlement, opened the way to new friendships and wider 
      contacts. The weaving school was a great success and brought many women 
      and girls into touch with beautiful work. </p>
      <p>On the side of educational class work the Settlement provided competent 
      lecturers in subjects that were close to the people’s interests.’ Although 
      all the classes held, and they were many, were informal, the standard set 
      was a high one. Time has shown that this provision was in direct line with 
      the needs of the people, because the educational classes and lectures have 
      grown from 9 in 1927 to 78 classes and 420 single lectures in 1937, and 
      the students from about 200 in 1927 to over 1,000 in 1937. The Settlement 
      staff, which began with two, to-day consists of twenty-four, including 
      lecturers and instructors in Economics, Biology, Music, Psychology, 
      Handicrafts, Drama, Play Centres, Physical Training, and Recreation. </p>
      <p>This first experiment worked like leaven, and soon attempts were made 
      to adapt it to the needs of other areas. Following close upon its 
      found2tion was the opening of a Settlement at Merthyr Tydfil, and an 
      original piece of work was begun at Dowlais. A little later Oxford House, 
      Risca, was opened, and was followed by Bargoed Educational Settlement in 1934. 
      [<i>page 12</i>] In 1936 by one at Aberdare and another at Pontypool. Plans are in hand 
      for a further one at Pontypridd, which it is expected will be in full work 
      during this winter. In the North of England a new Settlement was opened in 
      Seaham Harbour in 1930, and the latest development is one at Maryport in 
      West Cumberland, opened on September 22nd, 1937. </p>
      <p>Of the development in South Wales Sir Percy Watkins, formerly of the 
      Board of Education, says: “Each Settlement serves its own area, usually a 
      mining valley with a population varying from 50,000 to 130,000, and from 
      this significant fact there has grown, perfectly naturally, a somewhat 
      unique result, namely that each Settlement is not merely a central meeting 
      place for its associated clubs and groups and individuals, but is also a 
      power-station from which emanates guidance and advice.... A South Wales 
      Settlement is therefore a natural unit of organization within its area for 
      any form of social service which depends for the value of its contribution 
      upon a recognition of the cultural and social needs of that area as a 
      whole. . . . These focal points are institutions which in the midst of all 
      our changing social problems stand for something abiding and permanent and 
      stable....&quot; </p>
      <p>An account of this kind would be incomplete unless some reference were 
      made to the wider movement throughout the country which has been made 
      possible by the Special Area Fund and the interest and sympathy of the 
      Special Commissioner, Sir P. Malcolm Stewart, and his successor, Sir 
      George M. Gillett. This fund, administered mainly through the National 
      Council of Social Service, has been used to try to meet the greater need 
      throughout the country and has been applied in a variety of ways and with 
      varying degrees of success. There is no question, however, that those who 
      were responsible for the administration of that fund availed themselves of 
      the ideas that were being worked out at Maes-yr-Haf and in other 
      Settlements. </p>
      <p>One thing must not be overlooked, and that is that the Educational 
      Settlement in Special Areas did not begin with any orthodox conception of 
      what a Settlement should be, but only with the intense desire to meet a 
      very serious and demoralizing human situation, and an open mind as to how 
      that could be done. There now seems little doubt that the thing was right 
      in its inception, and that the life of thousands of people has been 
      effectively reached. </p>
      <p>Moreover, as time has gone on and it has become more clear that a very 
      large section of the mining community will never return to the one 
      occupation of which they have competent knowledge, and that they will 
      never have the chance of beginning life anew in some other district or in some other occupation, the Settlement is 
      destined to play a permanent part in their lives. </p>
