  <table border="0" width="585" bgcolor="#FFFFFF" cellpadding="8">
    <tr>
      <td width="575">
  <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">1994</font></p>
  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">TO
  EVERYONE WHO LOVES A COURSE IN MIRACLES(tm)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">It is
  imperative at this time for a clear statement to be made with regard to the
  direction in which A Course In Miracles is being taken by its custodians, the
  Foundation for Inner Peace, and the impact which it will have upon the Course,
  itself, together with the unconsidered element - the students of the Course,
  and the fact that it is they and not the Course who will be the transforming
  Presence of love which will precipitate Awakening.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">There is a
  plan being carried out by the Foundation which has as its goal the protection
  of the purity of the Course, and this is slowly being accomplished by the
  creation of certain structures which, when activated, will allow control of
  the dissemination of the Course and Course-related materials.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">The Course
  was naturally and appropriately copyrighted in 1975, thus giving the publisher
  the necessary means to keep the Course present in the world in its original
  form without being altered in any way. This act of copyrighting, whether of
  the original or any subsequent translations, [is] its protection, and nothing
  further is incumbent upon the publisher in order for its responsibility to be
  fully discharged.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">However, the
  publisher has taken it upon itself to do [more] than that, and as a result the
  words, &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; have been registered and trademarked
  [and] the letters &quot;ACIM&quot; have been incorporated into a logo which
  will appear on all new copies of the Course. The logo, of course, will become
  a registered trademark, thus insuring the unavailability of &quot;ACIM&quot;
  for use by students of the Course to identify [their] study groups, seminars,
  conferences, community center, etc. Indeed, according to Judy Skutch, as each
  new translation is published, not only will &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot;
  be trademarked in that language, the translated equivalent of &quot;ACIM&quot;
  will also be trademarked.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">While the
  trademark policy was being developed and implemented, there was a simultaneous
  alliance which was conceptualized between the Foundation for Inner Peace and
  the Foundation for A Course In Miracles in Roscoe, New York, headed by Dr.
  Kenneth Wapnick, and in a public statement they were dubbed &quot;sister
  foundations,&quot; thus distinguishing the Foundation For A Course In Miracles
  from all other foundations using &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; in their
  names and assuring it the right to [continue] using it after all others are
  asked to cease and desist.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">In addition,
  while all of this was happening, the Foundation For A Course In Miracles
  incorporated a new concept and function, that of being an Academy. It was a
  subtle shift, allowing those who had attended lectures on any number of topics
  relative to the Course in past years to unconsciously re-identify those talks
  as &quot;lectures&quot; at the &quot;Academy.&quot; It had a nice formal feel
  of academia, and since the publicity of the move likened the
  &quot;Academy&quot; to Plato's Academy, it conveyed a feeling of integrity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">Since then
  there have been unpublicized moves to ask those identifying themselves as
  &quot;teachers&quot; of the Course, even some quite well known to those in the
  growing Course community, to cease calling themselves teachers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">What has not
  been apparent to those who haven't recognized the &quot;signs of the
  times,&quot; is that before long it will be announced that classes for
  prospective teachers of &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; will be given at the
  Academy and, upon graduation, &quot;certification&quot; will be conferred,
  [and] these individuals will be the only ones who will be able to freely use
  &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; and &quot;ACIM&quot; relative to their
  teaching activities or teaching-related publications.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">You see, a
  shift occurred and the custodians of the &quot;Course&quot;--- the particular
  sequence of words, numbers, and punctuation marks which are uniquely
  identifiable as &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; - have metamorphosed into the
  teachers and protectors of its [meaning]. This is [not] the charge that was
  given them, and it is inconsistent with the Course, which, in all respects, is
  a self-teaching course.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">I understand
  that &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; [can] be read as a spiritual psychology
  which, when brought to bear on human experience, will transform human
  relationships, and that therefore, like any other psychology text, it can be
  treated as an academic text - taught precept upon precept, line upon line. But
  such a conceptual context constitutes a gross misapprehension of what it
  really is.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">&quot;A
  Course In Miracles&quot; can [only] be self-taught. It is, by its very
  structure, an intimate interaction between the reader and the material read.
  And because [its] curriculum was established by the Father's Intent for the
  Sonship to be consciously Whole, [it] cannot fail in its Purpose. You must
  understand therefore, that no &quot;human&quot; teacher can know the divine
  Intent of the words perceived by the individual reader [for] the reader, and
  that if, indeed, the teacher [did] know the divine Intent, he would find
  himself putting It into words which, although as hopelessly original as those
  in the &quot;Course&quot;, would [not] be the words in the Course.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">It is in the
  inviolable intimacy of the student and the Holy Spirit's curriculum that
  Remembering occurs. It is in that uninvadable intimacy, where no other teacher
  [can] enter, that the journey without distance occurs. It is in that intimate
  experience of Love that the Wholeness of the Sonship is consciously realized.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">I will tell
  you something: When a child is delivered, there is for a brief moment no more
  wonderful person in the world than the doctor or midwife who facilitated the
  event. But, the infatuation passes and the doctor, mother and child move on.
  Likewise, those who facilitated the entry of &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot;
  into the human experience --- and for whom all who have experienced its
  phenomenal meaning have the greatest admiration, respect, and even love ---
  must let the child go and do its work without hovering around it to ensure
  that no one misunderstands it or mistreats it, protecting it from the world
  [it] came to deliver into the Father's hands by means of the [Holy Spirit's]
  curriculum.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">Do not
  misunderstand. It is with great gratitude that I look upon their work in
  &quot;delivering&quot; the Course and continuing to extend it through
  translations into other languages. But I ask them to be alert and not stifle
  the child by attending to anything more than its continuing presence,
  unaltered from the form in which the unknowable Intent of the Holy Spirit
  makes [itself] known.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">I will tell
  you something else: A &quot;certifiable&quot; teacher of &quot;A Course In
  Miracles&quot; is one who teaches from the state of communion [on the spot]
  and not from &quot;learning.&quot; Let not the students, the teachers, or the
  midwives forget this and they will not become confused as to their duties.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">I am in
  agreement with the words &quot;A Course In Miracles&quot; being trademarked
  and used only as the title of the book published by the Foundation for Inner
  Peace. I agree that its use in the names of groups, associations, newsletters,
  foundations and any [title] of any kind should cease, so that it may be found
  [only on the one book so named]. But I gently declare that the letters &quot;ACIM&quot;
  and their equivalent in other languages, [need] to remain available to
  students of the Course throughout the world as a means of identifying the
  focus of interest in the names of their groups, associations, newsletters,
  foundations and publications, etc., relative to the Course.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">In addition,
  I further declare that the Foundation for ACIM (as it would be called) in
  Roscoe, New York, should claim &quot;sisterhood&quot; with all other
  foundations for ACIM and all other groups of students and teachers, having no
  special relationship with the Foundation for Inner Peace.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">The moment
  the Foundation for Inner Peace confirms publicly that it will cease promoting
  a [generic] terms to identify materials related to &quot;A Course In
  Miracles&quot; and [will] allow the unrestricted use of the letters ACIM to
  identify them all, the Northwest Foundation for A Course In Miracles will, in
  mutual agreement, immediately initiate steps to change its name to the
  Northwest Foundation for ACIM in harmony and unity with the FFIP's desire for
  harmony and unity.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">I ask for
  this communication to be forwarded to students of the Course everywhere, by
  all means of communication, and to as many of the study groups worldwide as it
  can possibly reach. And I ask those students to communicate with the
  Foundation for Inner Peace to register their feeling on these points. The need
  is for simultaneous unity, freedom [and] trust throughout the Course community
  so that the fundamental intimacy of the student with the Holy Spirit's
  curriculum does not become disturbed or distracted by fear, dissension,
  reaction or any apparent need for protection from any quarter.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, adobe-helvetica, Arial" size="2">The address
  of the Foundation for Inner Peace is:</font></p>
