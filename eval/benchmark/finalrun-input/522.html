The mission statement of the Hopkins outdoor program puts
the matter baldly. "We desire to push people out of their
comfort zone," it says, "so they can see themselves ... in
new ways." The question then becomes, how big is your
comfort zone? Would you be happy sleeping for a couple of
nights in a tent? How about a tent in the snow? How about a
tent in the snow in zero-degree weather? How about a tent
in the snow for 10 days with a low of minus 30, wind chill
not included? <p>

How about a tent in the snow and never quite getting warm
all day, needing to rest but afraid to stop moving because
then the freeze sets in? Your feet and hands losing all
feeling, the frostbite starting on your face? That's a
<i>different</i> idea of a comfort zone, a more special
one, and this January, those questions took on real meaning
for a group of Johns Hopkins students. They had set out for
two weeks of winter camping in the Adirondacks, prepared
for cold and snow and all the challenges entailed in that,
but they were destined to encounter truly serious cold,
Alaska-style cold, near-historic lows for the High Peaks
region of upper New York state. The whole literature of
survival in the winter wilderness, from Jack London's "To
Build a Fire" to Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air,</i>
suddenly seemed strangely relevant.<p>

The trip, organized as part of HOLT (Hopkins Outdoor
Leadership Training), placed the students in a situation
where "their decisions had real consequences," according to
Phil Zook Friesen, the university outdoor coordinator and
someone well-acquainted with the challenges of backwoods
winter travel. A former Sierra mountain guide, Friesen has
been developing a cadre of student leaders at Hopkins, men
and women trained in specific skills -- rock climbing,
backpacking, white water kayaking  -- and with tested
decision-making abilities. His goal is to be able to offer
an ever richer variety of outdoor activities for the
Hopkins community, in an atmosphere of safety and fun.<p>

Among the 14 students on the January expedition, several
were hoping to become student leaders in this summer's
Pre-Orientation Programs, which offer six- to eight-day
wilderness trips for incoming freshmen. Friesen divided his
group into two smaller squads, one called "Sleepy Bear" and
the other, aptly, "Frozen Circus." The plan: to travel from
Baltimore to upstate New York on the first day, then to
spend Days 2 and 3 at the Rock and River Lodge, testing
gear and making preparations to set out on Day 4. Both
groups would spend the nights of Days 4 and 5 at Camp Peggy
O'Brian, then would separate and take different trails into
the back country (see map). Each of the teams worked out an
itinerary through the wilderness, and, so that everyone
hoping to become a student leader could gain experience,
the directing duties were rotated daily.<p>



One of the leader candidates, Liz Pazdernik, a graduate
student in <a href="/~dogee/"> geography and
environmental</a> engineering, found herself in charge of
Frozen Circus on Day 8, a day of truly bitter cold -- minus
18 degrees Fahrenheit. <p>

"This was my first true backpacking trip," Pazdernik says,
"and maybe it was crazy to be doing that in the
Adirondacks, in January, but anyhow, there I was. It was
our second night out, and the temperatures had plummeted.
You immediately felt your fingers and your feet
freezing.... All you could think of was the cold, nothing
but that. And in that state of mind you had to decide if
your team should push on or evacuate. Basically, what in
the world we should do.<p>

"Among our group, I was probably the coldest," she adds.
"My co-leader went around to everybody and explained that
we were bad off, really pretty bad off ... that I hadn't
been warm in over 24 hours. Before conditions had become
that severe, it had been easy to tinker around being
leaders and decision-makers, but once it got that extreme,
you didn't want to eat, you didn't want to drink, all you
could think of was how cold you were."<p>

After some discussion, the group decided to send four
members west, toward a heated lodge at a lower elevation.
Here they could recuperate in some comfort, while the three
other members of the group snowshoed six miles in the other
direction, their goal being to recover the group's rented
vehicles, which had been left at the trailhead, then drive
around to the lodge on paved roads. This decision allowed
the team members who were suffering most to get immediate
relief, although at the cost of abandoning the group's
mountaineering objectives for the day (they had been hoping
to climb Yard Mountain and Big Slide Mountain).<p>

"There was a dual purpose to everything," Pazdernik says,
referring to the training in decision-making. "There was
the physical encounter with the conditions, unbelievably
harsh, and then also this thoughtful guided training in how
to make a smart call in the wilderness. You were
encountering your core fears, dealing with elemental
worries like frostbite and how do I ever get warm again,
and meanwhile undergoing this sophisticated process, this
exercise in interpersonal complexities."<p>

The leader candidates, although given considerable
autonomy, were supervised at all times by Friesen and by
six instructors who had been trained by Friesen and others.
Experiential education, the pedagogy that underlies
programs like HOLT and which owes a debt to Outward Bound
and similar movements, posits personal growth as a
dependable outcome of serious outdoor adventure. But any
professionally run program of this kind will be full of
fail-safe measures, backup personnel, and thoughtful plans
for dealing with all contingencies. The trick is to devise
genuine encounters with wilderness conditions that are
serious as well as fun, that call on outdoor skills in a
consequential way, but in an environment of carefully
managed risk.<p>

Friesen, who has been working in programs of this kind for
eight years, is a technical rock climber and a mountaineer.
He has a warm, easy manner that turns even stern encounters
with harsh conditions into exercises in relaxation: No,
this is not about proving your manhood or womanhood, not
about grimly holding on to the death, but rather about deep
play, about mastering skills that can free you in the
wilderness and also in life. His goal in developing student
leaders is to build a staff at Hopkins capable of leading
more trips, but even more to equip students to deal with
challenges of any sort. The aim is a deeper enjoyment, a
fuller immersion in a difficult world  -- mindfulness and
adventure-readiness.<p>

The High Peaks region -- the area that contains all the
Adirondack summits over 4,000 feet -- sees very little
traffic in the dead of winter. (Perhaps the reason is that,
as the Adirondack Mountain Club guidebook says, "the …
region presents an abundance of extremely steep terrain as
well as exposed alpine environments with the potential for
arctic weather conditions.") For Eric Schenfeld,
encountering the cold was really the point of the whole
adventure. "I'd never slept out in winter," he says, "and I
figured I could either do it now, while I'm at Hopkins, or
pay Outward Bound or somebody like that a lot of money
later." On the coldest mornings, "I woke up with no feeling
in my feet," says Schenfeld. "I rubbed them for a long time
and the only reason I knew that they were my feet, not
blocks of wood, was that I was looking at them." <p>

Schenfeld was in the same group, Frozen Circus, as Liz
Pazdernik. On Day 6, the team had climbed Lower Wolfjaw
Mountain (4,175 feet), then had hiked to an open-sided
shelter along Klondike Brook. That night was probably the
coldest 12-hour period of the trip. (It was also the
prelude to the decision, taken by Pazdernik and others, to
split Circus and evacuate to Rock and River Lodge.) At
around 8:30 a.m. the next morning, as they rubbed their
feet and tried to thaw their boots, which had frozen solid
despite being kept inside the tent, the temperature was
about minus 20 (presumably, it had been at least 10 degrees
colder during the night).<p>

Schenfeld was eager to push on, to try to snowshoe
energetically all day, because, as he explains, "That's the
only time I was really warm, really comfortably warm, when
we were out hiking with full packs on. The nights weren't
really restful ... you're in your sleeping bag for a long
time, and it's supposed to be the warmest time of day for
you, the time when you can recuperate. But it wasn't like
that. Even if you took a hot-water bottle into your
sleeping bag with you ... one person's hot-water bottle
froze solid and broke inside the sleeping bag."<p>

The travelers ate well -- hearty, carbohydrate-rich food
cooked on portable stoves -- and there was a lot of
horseplay and camaraderie on the trail. But at the end of
the day, no matter how much good feeling and enjoyment had
been generated, there were those nighttime hours to be
passed in the bone-chilling cold.<p>

In retrospect, Friesen, who attended to both teams but
traveled mostly with Sleepy Bear, thinks that Frozen Circus
may have suffered more than Sleepy Bear because, on the day
before the coldest night, they had snowshoed less far and
thus had warmed up less thoroughly. In contrast, Sleepy
Bear had gotten <i>seriously</i> warmed up trying to climb
Mount Marcy, the tallest peak in the Adirondacks (5,344
feet). "In the process, we lost the trail because of
blowing snow and other factors," says Friesen. "We were up
in elevation, and the leader of the day lost a little
control, as almost anybody would.... We spent about 45
minutes up around treeline, among the low shrubs and snow,
searching for the trail and not finding it. At last, one of
the students stumbled on it. It was now past noon and the
temperature was minus 10, minus 20 with the wind chill....
We got up pretty high, I'd say, but couldn't quite make the
summit, then headed north, toward Avalanche Pass, toward
the lean-to we knew was there."<p>

Friesen put some of the students into sleeping bags
immediately to warm them up and stave off hypothermia.
Several days earlier, Friesen had written in his private
journal: "Our first day in the field is drawing to a close
and it is brutally cold.... Hiking was not too bad, but ...
the cold was almost unbearable." And now, it was colder
than that, much colder. At Saranac Lake, some 25 miles
away, the recorded low was minus 31, and Friesen was fairly
sure that it had been even colder where his group was,
possibly minus 40 or below. As Friesen further noted in his
journal, "This course has been tough. One of the toughest
on me," because of his concern for his students, his wish
to deliver a stellar experience for everyone -- successful
ascents of winter mountains, fun times on the trail, warm
moments in the tents, lots of learning and growing and
maturing in the grip of nature. And here was nature, biting
back. <i>Hard.</i> "We have a beginner winter backpacking
course," he wrote, "and the temperatures could be
life-threatening if anything goes wrong.... Is this the
best way to teach leadership?" he wondered. "Is this course
accomplishing what it needs to or should?"<p>

On the day after Mount Marcy, Sleepy Bear remained in their
sleeping bags until after 11 a.m. Then around 1 p.m.,
despite continued bitter cold, the team roused itself and
snowshoed over Avalanche Pass and out onto frozen Avalanche
Lake. The day, though severely cold, was brilliantly
beautiful. Steep cliffs rise up on either side of Avalanche
Lake, which occupies a cleft in the mountains, and in those
surroundings, "Everyone just got lifted," says Howard
Chang, one of Friesen's student instructors. "Just to be
out and alive there was gorgeous. People had been bummed
about not getting to the summit the day before, but this
was an answer to that, a beautiful answer. It was
spectacular and it will always be one of my greatest
outdoor moments."<p>

<img src="images/cold4.jpg" align=right vspace=5 hspace=5>

Charged by the surroundings and thoroughly warmed up again,
the group returned to their bivouac spot near Avalanche
Pass. Here they spent a second, slightly less torturous,
night. Then on the morning of Day 9, they headed north, in
continuing extreme cold, aiming to rendezvous with Frozen
Circus at the Adirondack Rock and River Lodge <i>(pictured
at right)</i>, with its four walls, roof, and
well-functioning furnace.<p>

For Liz Pazdernik and the other members of Frozen Circus,
the lodge had felt good, very good, after the nights out in
the open, nights of frozen boots, fear of frostbite, and
five people jammed uncomfortably in a four-man tent. But
now, a second crisis in decision-making arose. Should they
stay where they were, comfortably indoors, or instead
venture out again, prove their mountaineering mettle? Most
of the students did want to go out again: The program as
originally designed called for another foray into the High
Peaks, this time without any instructors along, the
students keeping in touch with Friesen and the other staff
only by radio. Then, when Sleepy Bear also arrived at the
lodge, Friesen and his group joined the ongoing discussion.
Friesen and the instructors asked the students to spell out
the risks involved in going out again: What would it mean
to go to their "breaking point," Friesen asked, in
continued sub-minus 20-degree weather? What if somebody
suffered serious frostbite? How did you justify permanent
injury, possibly a friend's loss of fingers or toes, in the
name of your "personal search for limits"? All the talk of
the ethics of risk and adventure now became bracingly real.
(On those same days in mid-January, a group from Dartmouth
College had to litter out a participant from the same
region of the Adirondack High Peaks -- the point, as
Friesen's students came to realize, was that <i>any</i>
unexpected development could become life-threatening in
such cold.)<p>

Reluctantly -- but with a lot of good discussion and
"process" -- the group at last decided to cut the trip
short. It would not be 14 days long, it would only be 10
days. They consoled themselves with the promise, however,
of a session of ice climbing instruction in nearby Keene
Valley, where, as it happened, the yearly Adirondack
Mountain Festival was under way. But the chief ice climbing
guide there, fearing frostbite in weather expected to be
minus 12 or below, said no: In such conditions, the ice was
too brittle and might shatter from the blow of an ice
ax.<p>

Thus, a disappointing winter trip. Except that no one was
disappointed.<p>

"No, it was one of my best outdoor times," Howard Chang
says, "and I've been backpacking most of my life. I was
even an Eagle Scout. If the purpose was outdoor leadership
training, then this was beautifully designed.... Everyone
was definitely pushed to their limit, but no one went over
the limit, and that was because of the careful process.
Yeah, and it was fun, too. It was good to suffer!"<p>

Katy Juhaszova, a student participant who had never done
this kind of camping, says that she "loved the opportunity
to see things that I had never seen and really push myself
physically and mentally -- to get myself out of my comfort
zone and my routine. I came back so refreshed and
awakened," she adds. "For that, it was invaluable. Also
meeting other outdoors-oriented people from Hopkins,
getting a better idea of what was out there for me to get
involved in."<p>

And Emily Kumpel, one of the students hoping to become a
Pre-Orientation leader: "I thought there was an excellent
combination of outdoor skills, leadership training, and
group development. I especially liked the chance to bond
with the group," she says. "At first I thought having
leaders of the day was completely unfair, as I didn't feel
I could show my leadership when I was so unsure of what I
was doing. But as the course went on I realized what a true
test of leadership that was and how essential the process
is to learning. Leading when I had no idea what was going
on ... became my favorite part of the course."<p>

And Liz Pazdernik, who suffered so much from the cold, who
had to take the reins of leadership when she felt least up
to doing so: "I wouldn't take back a moment of it.... I now
know what it feels like to live outside in zero- to minus
30-degree weather," she says. "I'm now not worried about
hiking for a few miles with a heavy pack, and I know how to
find my way around the woods with a map and compass…. Since
being back I have a new, more lasting sense of
confidence....<p>

"I will never forget what it felt like to face the bottom
of my strength -- to face all of my anxieties at once,
particularly the fear of failure. I am already preparing
myself for more trips. The next thing will be rock
climbing.... I've committed myself to getting trained and
certified as a rock climbing leader this spring. <p>

"Ah," she says, "the glow of a successful experience!"<p>
