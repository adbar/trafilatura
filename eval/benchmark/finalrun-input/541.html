            is no wonder that in today's aggressive business environment, the
            challenge of sustaining a competitive advantage preoccupies the
            minds of many business leaders.</font><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Corporate customers and individual
            consumers have more providers to choose from than ever before.
            Furthermore, they often perceive that what they are purchasing is,
            for all practical purposes, a commodity that can be easily obtained
            from other companies if need be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">So how does a corporation distinguish
            itself in a highly &quot;commoditized&quot; and competitive market? Today's
            businesses are more dependent than ever before on their top
            performers to innovate and provide services that differentiate a
            company from its fierce competitors. In other words, corporations
            are reliant upon their human assets to survive and thrive.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, with unemployment now
            running at less than 6%, many corporations and government agencies
            are struggling to find and keep these valued employees. Changing
            work force demographics, such as the shrinking of the most desirable
            labor pool (25-34 year olds) and the negative impact downsizing has
            had on employee loyalty, has led corporate America to search for
            answers to recruiting and retaining the strategic asset of the
            twenty-first century: talented people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Retaining top talent was less of an
            issue in the past, but the shifting tides of the unspoken
            employee/employer contract have created new currents in the
            workplace. The old contract asked employees to:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">work hard</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">be loyal</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">give their all</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In return, they would have:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a job for life</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a home away from home</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">regular salary increases</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a good chance for a promotion</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The new contract is substantially
            different. It states that employees must now work harder, doing not
            only their jobs, but the jobs of their former co-workers who were
            &quot;right-sized.&quot; In return, job security is extinct,
            promotions are scarce, salary increases are modest at best, and the
            constant uncertainty of change is almost guaranteed. Is it any
            wonder that employee loyalty is on the demise and talented
            individual contributors and managers feel less bonded to their
            organizations?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Research</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">We conducted attrition and retention
            research with our clients, and substantiated our findings by
            reviewing industry practices and the behavioral science literature.
            We uncovered a number of critical findings, seven of which are
            described in this article.&nbsp; <i>Because of the sensitive nature
            of attrition problems, we have not identified our clients or other
            organizations by name in this document when citing examples of their
            retention problems or solutions.</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>1. The Costs of Attrition Can Be
            Staggering, But Often Unseen</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">What does it cost an organization
            when a talented employee defects to the competition? Some of the
            costs factors are obvious, such as the productivity losses due to a
            vacant position. However, there are often unseen costs, like the
            reduced productivity from the departing employee who is inevitably
            distracted during his or her job search and therefore contributes
            less during this time period (sometimes called &quot;short-timer's
            disease&quot;).</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Using conservative
            calculations, one technical company in California's Silicon Valley
            estimates that it cost them an average of $70,000 when just one
            employee leaves. Other companies calculate that attrition costs them
            annual productivity losses of 65-75% in the position the employee
            departs.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another clients with a national sales
            force of hundreds estimates that they have to scramble to make up
            for over a million dollars of potentially lost sales when just one
            salesperson leaves. To add insult to injury, this does not take into
            consideration the departed employee's attempts to woo his/her past
            customers over to his/her new employer. Multiply these costs by the
            number of employees who leave in a year and the financial impact is
            dramatic.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>2. The Reasons Employees Stay Are
            Not The Same As Why They Leave</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most organizations do not have a
            handle on the actual reasons why employees stay, as well as the
            actual reasons why they depart. Many organizations attempt to
            capture the causes of attrition through standard exit interviews.
            Unfortunately, traditional exit interviews just scratch the surface
            of the causes for attrition. They inevitably fail to differentiate
            between factors that make the new job attractive to the departing
            employee, versus the reasons why the employee was prompted to
            consider leaving his or her current job in the first place.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, many employees report
            &quot;better compensation&quot; as one of their main reasons for
            leaving. In many cases, our research revealed that these same
            employees were not, in fact, originally dissatisfied with their
            compensation. Instead, other reasons prompted them to consider
            leaving their current job, such as the absence of professional
            development opportunities. However, they often do not report these
            negative reasons associated with their old job (possibly for fear of
            retribution), but instead report what is attractive in the new job.
            Because of this phenomenon, organizational data from typical exit
            interviews fails to surface the real causes of an organization's
            attrition problems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is also true when an employee is
            actively recruited by the competition. Our work in retention shows
            that attractive candidates receive calls from recruiters all of the
            time! If this is so, what causes the sudden shift that makes the
            employee act on a recruiter's call at a particular point in time? We
            consistently found in these circumstances that something
            deteriorated in their work situations that caused them to take the
            current recruiter's call more seriously.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Obviously, when organizations
            unknowingly misdiagnose the situation and fail to surface the most
            critical factors that contribute to attrition, their solutions to
            correct the problem fall short of the mark. The result is a bad
            diagnosis leading to improper prescriptions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>3. The Manager's Role in Attrition
            Is Paramount But Underplayed</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Most managers we interviewed as part
            of our research in retention lamented the loss of talented
            contributors. However, when asked to diagnose the reasons for an
            employee's departure, the average manager pointed to a variety of
            external organizational factors as the causes of attrition, failing
            to take any personal responsibility for the situation. They
            typically did not acknowledge any factors within their control that
            contributed to the employee's departure.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, managers often
            attributed attrition problems to such factors as compensation.
            Certain factors that are the responsibility of &quot;the overall
            corporation&quot; can certainly aggravate attrition if they are not
            in order, such as inequitable pay scales or excessively rigid
            policies that dilute employee autonomy. However, we discovered that
            a large number of factors contributing to employee retention are
            within the manager's circle of influence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, the results of any
            attrition intervention are dependent upon the organization's ability
            to provide managers with an awareness of those factors, as well as
            tools to help them meet their personal accountability in retaining
            top talent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Furthermore, managers need this
            guidance more than ever before. The managers' span of control has
            been widening in most companies over the past several years, and the
            number of times the manager 'touches&quot; the employee is therefore
            less frequent. Each contact must maximize any opportunity to
            influence employee motivation and commitment.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>4. Prevention Is The Best Medicine</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The loss of key employees, even in
            small numbers, can be devastating to a company. (This points to the
            importance of tracking not just overall attrition ratios, but also
            tracking the level of performers leaving.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Consequently, we were interested in
            determining the degree to which managers rank retention as a high
            on-going priority. Not surprisingly, we found that the only time the
            average manager thinks about retention is when she or he receives a
            resignation from an employee. We also found that most managers
            predictably attempt to talk departing employees out of leaving,
            trying to convince them that they are making a mistake.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">However, also predictably, we found
            that the vast majority of the time, these employees leave their
            resignations on the table, resisting attempts to persuade them to
            stay. And, in the infrequent situation when a manager successfully
            persuades the employee to remain, he or she often leaves within six
            to nine months anyway. (The exception is when there is a clear
            salary inequity which is remedied, and the employee is satisfied
            with everything else about the work situation.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Clearly, the solution lies in tying
            retention to critical business activities so that managers do not
            think about retention after the fact, when it is too late, but
            rather see it as integral to business success and survival. Treating
            retention as an on-going priority enables the manager to focus on
            proactive measures to sustain long term employee commitment rather
            than on reactive attempts to reverse surprise resignations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>5. Retention Has An Often
            Unrecognized Impact on the Customer</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Managers are well aware of the impact
            on their function when a valued employee leaves. However, even
            managers of customer contact functions, such as sales or customer
            service, often fail to demonstrate a sensitivity to the impact
            attrition has on customers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When key employees leave customer
            contact functions, customers often experience:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a discontinuity in the
                relationship</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">a negative impact on their own
                productivity</font></li>
              <li><font face="Arial" size="2">time wasted reorienting the new
                employee to their operation and the way they work</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">When the relationship represents a
            value-added partnership, the change in account managers or service
            providers can set the relationship back months and give competitors
            a weighty advantage. This is especially true if the transition to
            new account personnel is not well managed. At a certain point,
            regular changes in account personnel can send a message of
            organizational instability and create the impression that the
            organization does not care about the account relationship.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">In the case of development or support
            functions, we also found a general lack of awareness on the
            manager's part of the negative impact the departing employee has on
            internal customers. The departure of a top performing employee can
            therefore have a &quot;ripple effect&quot; on the organization and
            its clients that creates problems for months.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>6. Misguided Thinking -
            &quot;Attrition is Inevitable&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is true that some level of
            attrition is unavoidable. In fact, a certain degree of attrition is
            desirable in order to compensate for poor hiring decisions. However,
            human resource and senior line managers often question whether they
            can really increase their retention ratios.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The answer is definitively yes, with
            evidence to support it. In one of our client organizations, the
            attrition rate for one of their divisions in 1995, prior to our
            intervention, was 18.5%, with 25% attrition in one of the most
            critical occupation groups. After working with us in 1996 and making
            retention a priority for every manager, the attrition rate dropped
            to 11.7% overall and 15% in the critical group.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One might predict that other factors
            contributed to this outcome. In fact, it should be noted that there
            were actually reductions in employee compensation during this time,
            which should have increased attrition. Nevertheless, we still saw an
            increase in retention rates.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another client asked that we conduct
            a retention risk analysis and intervention in a critical technical
            division because the organization feared that attrition would rise
            in the near future. Two interesting findings emerged from our
            research with this group. The first was that this division was
            already following a number of the retention prescriptions we provide
            our clients (one of the few divisions in the entire company to do
            so). More striking, however, was the fact that as a result of
            following these prescriptions, this group's retention rates were
            over 10% higher than the rest of the company's, thus validating the
            efficacy of our model.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Another company in the Northwest
            began with an attrition rate of 17%. After following the same
            prescriptions, they reduced their attrition rate to 3%, bringing
            their retention rate up to 97%. As the evidence suggests, attrition
            is not an unbeatable foe. Instead, it is a challenge that can be
            overcome with the right strategies and tools.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>7. World Class Retention Reflects
            A Multi-Factored Solution</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The scenario in many organizations is
            the same. Someone, such as a senior line manager or HR professional
            who is tied to the business, raises the red flag of attrition,
            recognizing it's potentially devastating impact on the company's
            strategic position. Then, someone scrambles to pull some sort of
            training or tools together which focuses on only a few (but not all)
            of the factors that are required to reduce attrition. The result is
            the organization experiences mediocre results, or no results at all.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">This multi-factored retention
            solution is like the story of the blind men and the elephant. Never
            having seen an elephant, three blind men were brought over to a
            young elephant to let them experience it. Each man touched a part of
            the elephant. The first one touched a leg and said, &quot;Now I
            understand. An elephant is like a tree trunk.&quot; The second man
            touched the tail and said, &quot;No. You are wrong. An elephant is
            like a snake.&quot; The third man touched an ear and said, &quot;You
            are both quite mistaken. An elephant is like the leaf of a big palm
            tree.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">If any of the men wanted to control
            the elephant, they would have found themselves incapable of doing
            so, because their understanding of the elephant was only partial.
            This is also true of many organizations that try to tackle only one
            factor of the attrition dilemma.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">One piece of anecdotal evidence comes
            from a report made by one of the nation's leading financial services
            companies. In an attempt to stem the outflow of critical managers
            and individual contributors, they contracted with a reputable
            training firm with whom they had worked successfully in the past.
            While the firm admitted they were not experts in employee retention,
            they nevertheless conducted sessions for senior managers, hoping to
            help their client to deal effectively with the problem.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunately, but also predictably,
            the firm addressed only a fragment of the retention solution. The
            kick back from the managers was strong, since they intuitively
            sensed this was only a partial solution and it would not effectively
            address their issues. Therefore, one litmus test for a retention
            solution is to assess its scope and depth. Any solution that is one-dimensional
            is bound to fail.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Conclusion</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Interestingly enough, organizational
            experts predicted that mergers and downsizing would result in
            employees who felt lucky to have a job and who would, of course,
            stay. This may be true for employees in the lower tiers of
            performance. However, top talented employees recognize they
            represent a valued organizational asset. When their loyalty
            deteriorates, the tendency to switch organizations increases.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">The average costs of replacing
            today's defecting work force is eating away at the profitability of
            even the healthiest organizations. Even when the bottom line remains
            intact, the loss of just a handful of key employees who have a
            special expertise or who maintain valued customer relationships can
            shake an organization to it's roots. In this age of high stakes and
            unpredictable market and organizational changes, organizations must
            educate their managers and create an environment where today's top
            talent can thrive. The alternative is unacceptable.</font></p>
