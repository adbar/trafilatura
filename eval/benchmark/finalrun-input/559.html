  Declaration on Marriage</i></b></font></h2>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As we celebrate the 2000<sup>th</sup> anniversary 
  of the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ, entering the third millennium, we pledge 
  together to honor the Lord by committing ourselves afresh to God&#146;s first 
  institution &#151; marriage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We believe that marriage is a holy union of one man and 
  one woman in which they commit, with God&#146;s help, to build a loving, life-giving, 
  faithful relationship that will last for a lifetime. God has established the 
  married state, in the order of creation and redemption, for spouses to grow 
  in love of one another and for the procreation, nurture, formation and education 
  of children.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We believe that in marriage many principles of the Kingdom 
  of God are manifested. The interdependence of healthy Christian community is 
  clearly exemplified in loving one another (John 13:34), forgiving one another 
  (Ephesians 4:32), confessing to one another (James 5:16), and submitting to 
  one another (Ephesians 5:21). These principles find unique fulfillment in marriage. 
  Marriage is God&#146;s gift, a living image of the union between Christ and 
  His Church.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We believe that when a marriage is true to God&#146;s loving 
  design it brings spiritual, physical, emotional, economic, and social benefits 
  not only to a couple and family but also to the Church and to the wider culture. 
  Couples, churches, and the whole of society have a stake in the well-being of 
  marriages. Each, therefore, has its own obligations to prepare, strengthen, 
  support and restore marriages. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our nation is threatened by a high divorce rate, a rise 
  in cohabitation, a rise in non-marital births, a decline in the marriage rate, 
  and a diminishing interest in and readiness for marrying, especially among young 
  people. The documented adverse impact of these trends on children, adults, and 
  society is alarming. Therefore, as church leaders, we recognize an unprecedented 
  need and responsibility to help couples begin, build, and sustain better marriages, 
  and to restore those threatened by divorce.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Motivated by our common desire that God&#146;s Kingdom be 
  manifested on earth as it is in heaven, we pledge to deepen our commitment to 
  marriage. With three-quarters of marriages performed by clergy, churches are 
  uniquely positioned not only to call America to a stronger commitment to this 
  holy union but to provide practical ministries and influence for reversing the 
  course of our culture. It is evident in cities across the nation that where 
  churches join in common commitment to restore a priority on marriage, divorces 
  are reduced and communities are positively influenced.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Therefore, we call on churches throughout America to do 
  their part to strengthen marriage in our nation by providing:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Prayer and spiritual support for stronger marriages</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Encouragement for people to marry</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Education for young people about the meaning and responsibility 
    of marriage</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Preparation for those engaged to be married</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pastoral care, including qualified mentor couples, for 
    couples at all stages of their relationship</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Help for couples experiencing marital difficulty and 
    disruption</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Influence within society and the culture to uphold the 
    institution of marriage.</font></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Further, we urge churches in every community to join in 
  developing policies and programs with concrete goals to reduce the divorce rate 
  and increase the marriage rate.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By our commitment to marriage as instituted by God, the 
  nature of His Kingdom will be more clearly revealed in our homes, our churches, 
  and our culture. To that end we pray and labor with the guidance of the Holy 
  Spirit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">May the grace of God, the presence of Christ, and the empowerment 
  of the Holy Spirit be abundant in all those who so commit and be a blessing 
  to all whose marriages we seek to strengthen.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> The National Association of Evangelicals, 
  the National Council of Churches of Christ and America's two largest denominations, 
  the Roman Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention &#151; had never 
  cooperated on anything prior to signing &quot;A Christian Declaration on Marriage.&quot; 
  They were moved to do so by the documented disintegration of marriage in America 
  and the evidence seen in dozens of American cities &quot;where churches join 
  in common commitment to restore a priority on marriage, divorces are reduced 
  and communities are positively influenced,&quot; as they put it. This memo provides 
  data on the scale of the problem as well as an overview of the progress that 
  has been made locally when churches &quot;provide practical ministries and influence 
  for reversing the course of our culture.&quot; </font></p>
<h3 align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marriage In America Is Disintegrating</font></b></h3>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">There has been an alarming disintegration of marriage in America: </font> 
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Divorces tripled</b> from 1960 and 1979, rising from 
    390,000 to 1,181,000. By 1997 they declined only 1.5% to 1,163,000. More marriages 
    now end in divorce than death.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The marriage rate fell 35% </b>between 1970 and 1998. 
    Only 56% of U.S. adults are married today, down from 73%. There are only 2.38 
    million marriages a year.<br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Cohabitation skyrocketed 10-fold, 
	</font> </b><font size="2">from 430,000 
    in 1960 to 4.26 million living together in 1998. <i>Cohabitation, not marriage, 
    is the <b>dominant </b>way male-female unions are formed.</i></font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"> <br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cohabitation is a double cancer of marriage.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <br>
    a. For millions, cohabitation is a substitute for marriage. A quarter of unmarried 
    women aged 25-39 are currently living with a partner, and an additional quarter 
    have done so in the past. According to the University of Wisconsin, of 100 
    couples who begin living together 40 break up before a wedding. One result: 
    the number of never-married couples has doubled from 21 million in 1970 to 
    46.5 million in 1998, diverting 25 million from getting married at all. <br>
    b. The second cancer is that cohabitation increases a couple's odds of divorce 
    by 50%. What many call a &quot;trial marriage&quot; should be more accurately 
    termed a &quot;trial divorce.&quot; The only question is whether they break 
    up before the wedding or afterward. So of the 100 cohabiting couples, 60 will 
    marry, but 45 will divorce. That leaves only 15 couples still together after 
    a decade! <br>
    <br>
    </font></li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Children of divorce </b>are the greatest victims 
    of divorce. They are twice as likely as children from an intact family to 
    drop out of school, three times more likely to have a child out of wedlock, 
    six times more likely to be in poverty or to commit suicide, and 12 times 
    more likely to be incarcerated. Furthermore, as Judith Wallerstein's powerful 
    new book, <i>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce, </i>documents the impact of 
    divorce on kids &quot;grows at least into the third decade.&quot; Based on 
    interviews of 100 children of divorce over 25 years, she reports that &quot;From 
    the viewpoint of the children, and counter to what happens to their parents, 
    divorce is a cumulative experience. Its impact increases over time and rises 
    to a crescendo in adulthood. In adulthood it affects personality, the ability 
    to trust, expectations about relationships and ability to cope with change... 
    Anxiety leads many into making bad choices in relationships, giving up hastily 
    when problems arise, or avoiding relationships altogether.&quot;</font></li>

<h3 ALIGN="left"><i><font face="Verdana" size="3" color="#800000">Good News: Marriage is the Key to Happiness, 
  Long Life, Wealth!</font></i></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Linda Waite and Maggie Gallagher point out in their important 
  new book, <i>The Case For</i> <i>Marriage, </i>married people are healthier, 
  happier, wealthier, live longer and have better sex than those who divorce or 
  remain single. Oddly, this is news to our culture. Thus, secular evidence backs 
  up Scripture. &quot;The Lord God said, `It is not good for the man to be alone. 
  I will make a helper suitable for him'&quot; (Genesis 2:18).<b> </b>Selected 
  data in brief:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><b><u><font size="2">Happiness:</font></u><font size="2">
	</font> </b><font size="2">Married people are twice as 
    likely as those who are single for whatever reason to say they are &quot;very 
    happy.&quot; Some 40% of married couples say they are very happy, compared 
    to 15% of the separated, 18% of the divorced. What's surprising is that only 
    22% of the never-married and cohabitors are very happy, the same as widows.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br></font></li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><u><font size="2">Longevity:</font></u><font size="2">
	</font> </b><font size="2">A married man of 48 has an 
    88% chance of living until age 65, but a divorced man has only a 65% odds 
    of survival!<b> </b>A married woman aged 48 has an 92% chance of living to 
    age 65; but a divorced woman's odds are only 82%. Divorced men are twice as 
    likely to suffer from heart attacks, cancer and four times as likely to be 
    in automobile accidents or to commit suicide, reports J.J. Lynch in <i>The 
    Broken Heart</i>. </font> </font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br></font></li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><u><font size="2">Wealth:</font></u></b><font size="2"> A married couple in their 50's 
    in 1994 had net assets of $132,000 or $66,000 per person. However, a divorced 
    person's assets are just $33,600. Surprisingly, a never-married individual 
    has a net worth of only $35,000; the separated, a pitiful $7,600. </font> </font>
	<font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br></font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana"><u><b><font size="2">Sex:</font></b></u><font size="2"> &quot;Married sex really is better 
    sex,&quot; report Waite and Gallagher. &quot;Married women are almost twice 
    as likely as divorced or never-married women to have a sex life that (a) exists 
    and (b) is extremely emotionally satisfying.&quot; Some 43 percent of married 
    men had sex at least twice a week vs. only 26 percent of single men. </font> </font>

<font face="Verdana" color="#800000"><b>Churches Have Proven Answers</b> </font>
</span></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some churches have developed reforms that are preparing 
  couples for a lifelong marriage, strengthening existing marriages or saving 
  troubled ones. Catholics created strong premarital programs, but many post-marital 
  pioneering ministries have come from Protestants:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Time: </font> </b><font size="2">For a generation, most Catholic dioceses 
    have required a minimum time of marriage preparation &#151; typically six 
    months from the time a priest first meets with the couple, 'til the wedding. 
    During that time, many couples are asked to take a premarital inventory to 
    give them an objective view of strengths and weaknesses and attend classes 
    on such issues as communication and finances. The results of better marriage 
    preparation is clear in a recent George Barna survey showing Catholics have 
    America's lowest divorce rate.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Premarital Inventory: </font> </b>
	<font size="2">There are two widely used 
    premarital inventories, FOCCUS and PREPARE, each taken by about 200,000 couples 
    a year. Either can predict with 80% accuracy which couples will divorce. More 
    important, a <i>tenth of those who take either inventory, break their engagements. 
    </i>Studies show their scores are equal to those who marry and later divorce! 
    Consequently, those couples who break an engagement<b> avoid a bad marriage 
    before it begins.</b></font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Mentor Couples in Marriage Preparation:</b> Mike 
    &amp; Harriet McManus trained 52 Mentor Couples in their home church to administer 
    a premarital inventory with seriously dating and engaged couples. From 1992-2000 
    Mentors worked with 308 couples. About 50 broke off their relationship/engagement 
    -- 16.5% of the total. Thus, those in weak relationships discovered it on 
    their own and either broke up or strengthened their union. Mentors also taught 
    couples how to improve communication and conflict resolution. Of the 250+ 
    who did marry, there are only six known divorces in eight years,<i> a failure 
    rate of 2.4%. </i></font></li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Marriage Encounter </font> </b>
	<font size="2">has been attended by 1.6 million 
    Catholic couples and 600,000 Protestants. After Lead Couples share intimate 
    details of their marriage, attending couples write to each other on assigned 
    topics and discuss them privately. The process encourages participating couples 
    to communicate more deeply. Sixty studies show that 80% to 90% of attendees 
    <i>fall back in love, and permanently improve the quality of their marriage. 
    </i><b>Family Life Weekends</b> led by evangelicals are another weekend retreat 
    to strengthen marriages.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Retrouvaille </font> </b>
	<font size="2">is a similar weekend retreat developed 
    by Catholics. However the Lead Couples are those whose marriages once nearly 
    failed. These &quot;back-from-the-brink&quot; couples share details about 
    how they overcame years of adultery, alcoholism, physical abuse, etc., to 
    build solid marriages. The results are stunning. Of 60,000 couples who attended, 
    <i><b>four</b> <b>out of five couples have rebuilt their marriages.</b></i> 
    However, in most cities <b>Retrouvaille </b>is held only 2-3 times a year.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Marriage Ministry</font></b><font size="2"> is a similar proven way to 
    save couples headed for divorce, but it is based in local churches. Rev. Dick 
    &amp; Phyllis McGinnis, formerly of St. David's Episcopal Church in Jacksonville, 
    Florida trained seven couples whose marriages nearly failed to help those 
    now in trouble. One woman had been in an adulterous affair for eight years. 
    A man was a bisexual who had homosexual affairs. Another was an alcoholic 
    who lost his job and was out of work for two years. Yet they identified 17 
    steps <b>all</b> experienced to save their marriages. They shared their path 
    of recovery with 40 troubled marriages, and saved 38 of them<i> -- a 95% success 
    rate. </i><b>Marriage Ministry </b>has spread to 25 churches. In seven of 
    them, 40 Mentor Couples have worked with 213 troubled marriages, and saved 
    193 of them. <i><b>That's a success rate of 90% </b>in the transplants. </i>
	</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
  </font>
  </li>
  <li> <font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Stepfamily Support Groups:</font></b><font size="2"> Some 46% of all marriages 
    today involve at least one spouse who was previously married. Families with 
    stepchildren are the most explosive in America -- breaking up at a 65% rate. 
    Stepchildren resent their new &quot;parent&quot; and often drive them away. 
    Rev. Dick Dunn of Roswell United Methodist Church near Atlanta created a &quot;Stepfamily 
    Support Group&quot; led by couples with truly blended families. Result: four 
    out of five couples make it, the mirror opposite of usual failure. These groups 
    have been planted in other churches.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
    <br>
 	</font>
 </ol>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The core idea of the best programs, summarized in one sentence: </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>In every church there are couples with good marriages</b> 
  <b>who really could</b> <b>be of help to other couples, but have never been 
  asked, inspired or trained to come alongside another couple and share their 
  wisdom on how to make a marriage successful.</b></i></font></p>
<h3 ALIGN="left"><i><b><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">Mentoring Is a Biblical Concept</font></b></i></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mentoring model is based on age-old Biblical principles. 
  In his letter to Titus, Paul urged the older women to &quot;train the younger 
  women to love their husbands and children.&quot; Similarly, the older men are 
  to set &quot;an example&quot; to the younger men. (Titus 2:3-6). A <b>Marriage 
  Savers Church</b> demonstrates, in the area of marriage, that the pastor's task, 
  as St. Paul instructed the Ephesians (4:12) is to &quot;equip the saints for 
  ministry&quot; or to &quot;train God&#146;s people for service.&quot; What more 
  important ministry or service is there than saving marriages? Who is better 
  equipped to lead this ministry or service than married couples in long-term, 
  happy marriages?&quot; Luke 10:1 says Jesus sent his disciples out &quot;two 
  by two.&quot; Could this not be husband and wife, husband and wife serving as 
  Mentor Couples, bringing hope to the marital darkness?</font></p>
<h3 ALIGN="left"><i><b><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">&quot;Marriage Saver Churches&quot;</font></b></i></h3>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the most exciting developments in recent 
  years is to witness the emergence of &quot;Marriage Savers Churches&quot; in 
  all parts of America. Churches of very diverse denominations -- Mainline, Evangelical, 
  Pentecostal and African-American churches -- have virtually eliminated divorce! 
  Christ Lutheran Church in Overland Park, KS, for example, a congregation of 
  1,500 people, has had only two divorces in three years, couples who did not 
  seek help. First Assembly of God of Rockford, IL invited the McGinnises to train 
  14 &quot;back-from-the-brink&quot; couples in their church to work with troubled 
  marriages. Local therapists learned about <b>Marriage Ministry</b> and sent 
  dozens of their toughest cases to First Assembly. In three years, the Mentors, 
  whom they call &quot;Marriage Savers,&quot; have met with more than 100 marriages 
  headed toward divorce, and saved all but four of them. By contrast, even Christian 
  therapists save only 20% of the troubled marriages. Bread of Life, an inner 
  city church in Kansas City, KS has had no divorces since training Mentors. The 
  same is true of Killearn United Methodist Church, a congregation of 2,500 in 
  Tallahassee. Pearce Memorial Church in North Chili, NY has had only one separation 
  in two years. An American Baptist congregation, First Baptist of Sioux Falls, 
  SD trained 40 couples for marriage, losing none to divorce, and worked with 
  10 troubled marriages, losing only one. To learn more, see <a href="sixchurches.htm">&quot;Churches&quot; 
  </a></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These churches are implementing all of the reforms outlined 
  above. How? Each<b> </b>has equipped couples with solid marriages to mentor 
  other couples. According to their own marital histories, they are trained and 
  matched to assist other couples:</font></p>
<ul>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Avoid a bad marriage before it begins</font></b></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Obtain &quot;marriage insurance&quot; as an engaged 
    couple</font></b></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strengthen existing marriages</font></b></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Restore 80% to 90% of troubled marriages</font></b></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reconcile more than half of the separated</font></b></li>
  <li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Enable 80% of stepfamilies to be successful</font></b></li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wrote a new <i>Manual</i> <i>To Create a Marriage Savers 
  Congregation </i>with details on how to jump-start all of these reforms.<i> 
  </i>The 183-page <i>Manual </i>has different Sections on how Mentor Couples 
  can help at all stages of the marital life cycle: preparation, enrichment, reconstruction 
  of troubled marriages, reconciliation of the separated and Stepfamilies. There 
  are manageable, concrete steps to make it easy for any church to launch these 
  ministries. Marriage Savers offers a two-day training of clergy and Mentor Couples 
  to immerse them in how to launch Marriage Saver Churches. It is held nationally 
  twice a year taught by the pioneers of the ministries outlined above. This training 
  is also provided to couples and pastors in cities that adopt a &quot;Community 
  Marriage Policy&quot; where clergy pledge to start all of these marital reforms. 
  </font></p>
<h3 ALIGN="left"><i><b><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">The Community Marriage Policy<sup>®</sup></font></b></i></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1986, at my suggestion, the clergy of Modesto, CA, 95 
  Protestant and Catholic pastors, signed the first Community Marriage Policy® 
  with the goal &quot;<i><b>to radically reduce the divorce rate of those married 
  in area churches.&quot;</b></i> Fifteen years later, that dream is a reality. 
  <i>The divorce rate has fallen 47.6%, </i>saving about 1,300 marriages a year 
  that would have ended in divorce in a county of 400,000 people. (See my column 
  on p. 3 for details.) Marriage Savers, has helped create 136 Community Marriage 
  Policies® or Community Marriage Covenants® as some clergy call them, as of February, 
  2001. They are in 38 states and range in size from 20 pastors in Culpeper, Virginia 
  to 300 clergy who signed in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Most include a commitment 
  by Catholic, Mainline, Evangelical and minority pastors to:</font></p>

  Marriage Policies</font></b></i></h3>
<p ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Divorces have plunged in 31 of 33 cities where 
  the impact of Community Marriage Policy<sup>® </sup>has been measured with data 
  on divorces from county courts. Nationally, U.S. divorces have fallen from 1,181,000 
  in 1979 to 1,163,000 in 1997, a decline of only 1.5% in 19 years. By contrast, 
  Modesto's divorce rate plunged a remarkable 47.5% in 15 years. The divorce rate 
  is falling even faster in newer CMP cities. In only three years, divorces plummeted 
  by 18% in Corvallis, OR and Fremont, NE, by 19% in Chattanooga, and by nearly 
  one-third in El Paso (from 3,176 to 2,179) and in Kansas City, KS and two suburban 
  counties (from 1,530 in 1995 to only 1,034 in 1998), while divorces actually 
  rose across the river in Kansas City, MO and its suburbs! Thus, divorces in 
  both Kansas City and El Paso have fallen <i><b>22 times more than in the U.S. 
  in about one-sixth of the time </b></i>(3 years vs. 19 years), or <i>more than 
  100 times faster than in the U.S. </i></font></p>
<h3 ALIGN="left"> <i> <b><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">A National Strategy to Save Marriages</font></b></i></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ours is a nation of 300,000 churches. If only a third trained 
  10 Mentor Couples each, there would be one million Mentor Couples! Surely, they 
  could save half of the marriages ending in divorce. Can we make that dream a 
  reality? </font></p>

<h3><i><font face="Verdana" color="#800000">Conclusion</font></i></h3>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the night before he died, Jesus prayed that his followers 
  &quot;may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you.&quot; Sadly, 
  the Christian church is splintered into scores of denominations and thousands 
  of independent churches who never seem to be one. However, in community after 
  community, marriage is an issue that is bonding the shattered Christian church. 
  Clergy of all faiths have come together in 136 cities to create Community Marriage 
  Policies that are driving divorce rates down. Each Covenant is what Jesus called 
  a &quot;city on a hill,&quot; sending out beams of hope into the marital darkness. 
  Every church in America has couples who could help other couples at key stages 
  of marriage, building a &quot;safety net&quot; under every marriage. God will 
  bless our effort to work together to strengthen His first institution. Jesus 
  called himself the bridegroom of the church. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"> What God has joined together, the church should hold together. 
  This is a new vision for the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Church &#151; a noble reaffirmation 
  of our common commitment to Jesus Christ on the 2000<sup>th</sup> anniversary 
  of His birth.</font></p>
