<p class="main-body"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p class="main-body">Organisations across Australia are increasingly moving 
towards external service providers for the provision of IT services. As a 
result, contract management is becoming one of the core activities of overall IT 
management. With 97% of Australian organisations outsourcing at least some 
aspect of their IT services and nearly 30% of the IT budget on average, contract 
planning and management has become one of the core competencies of any IT 
responsibility. <br>
<br>
The changing nature of contracting means that the managing responsibility 
transcends the traditional, more administrative role. To manage today’s 
contracts, a direct role must be played at a strategic and operational level to 
ensure value for money is achieved and risks are minimised.<br>
<br>
This hands-on training course will deliver the key framework for planning and 
managing IT contracts from design through to disengagement. The course consists 
of three intensive days of pragmatic methods comprising numerous interactive 
exercises, case studies and a role playing session, designed to assist you 
determine the best and most effective contracting techniques for your 
organisation. You will be split into small groups with similar IT expertise 
areas to ensure you have the maximum opportunity to have your individual 
questions and needs addressed. The training has been written and will be 
presented by Joe Caruso. Joe is a Director of The Cullen Group (www.cullengroup.com.au), 
an organisation that provides expert outsourcing, SLA and Contract Management 
advice for all aspects of the sourcing and contracting lifecycle.</p>
