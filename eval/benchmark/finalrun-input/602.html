<h2>Active Adults Want Homes They've Always Dreamed About</h2>
<p><i>By Kendall Carre</i></p>
<p>Merchandising for an “active adult” community starts with identifying today's active seniors. Today’s 55-year-olds are a different breed than their counterparts of only a decade ago, and that means this market segment must be redefined.&nbsp;
<P></P>
<P>For example, older adults will be retiring later, often for financial reasons but also for pure enjoyment. </P>
<P>When attempting to define today’s “active adults,” there is one thing for certain: They are active. They eat healthier, exercise regularly, spend more time&nbsp;on hobbies and are living longer.</P>
<P>Their vision of a new home is closer to their dream home than anything they’ve previously owned, right down to the interior design. </P>
<P>“The interior merchandising for these homes should create a personal focus revolving around the individuals who will be living here,”&nbsp;says Debra Newell, founder and president of Tustin, CA-based <A target=_blank href="http://www.ambrosiainteriordesign.com/home.htm">Ambrosia Interior Design, Inc.</A>

                  <blockquote>
</P>
<P>A good example comes from the 14 new model homes at Pulte/<A target=_blank href="http://www.delwebb.com/default.asp">Del Webb</A>'s <A target=_blank href="http://www.delwebb.com/activeadult/california/suncitylincolnhills/index.shtml">Sun City Lincoln Hills</A>&nbsp;in Lincoln, CA, which Ambrosia is merchandising.</P>
<P>Ranging from just under 1,200 to more than 3,000 square feet, these homes are designed to appeal to boomers&nbsp;— in both architecture and merchandising. The homes are larger, with bigger kitchens and more space for entertaining. There is enough room for example, for a large dining table for family gatherings and&nbsp;there are&nbsp;special places for hobbies, home offices, exercise and relaxation.</P>
<P><STRONG>Fill the Home With Their Favorite Things</STRONG></P>
<P>A&nbsp;home’s personalization is key to its appeal to active adults, Newell points out.</P>
<P>“Buyers are looking at this home as the one they can finally do their way,” he says. “They want everything to be the nicest they’ve ever owned.”</P>
<P>Most buyers have owned and decorated several homes over the years. They’ve learned from their mistakes and want to fill this home with their favorite things.</P>
<P>“If the buyer’s passion is cooking, they will spend a large amount of their option dollars on things like granite or Cesarstone countertops, and glazed cabinets with glass doors.” adds Newell.</P>
<P>Buyers at Sun City Lincoln Hills are spending $50,000-$60,000 for architectural upgrades and options such as flooring and countertops.</P>
<P><STRONG>Low Maintenance Is Another Hot Button</STRONG></P>
<P>Although active adult home buyers desire the best in everything, they do not want a home that requires plenty of upkeep. Low maintenance and high quality are the hot buttons for these buyers, and creating a balance between the two is essential. </P>
<P>Newell says that the interiors&nbsp;of active adult homes&nbsp;should be&nbsp;lighter and brighter than&nbsp;what is found in a typical&nbsp;single-family home.</P>
<P>“We see 35% less light as we get older, so the rooms are painted in warmer, lighter colors and awash in at least three light sources,” he says.</P>
<P>At Ambrosia, designers use this lightness as a backdrop for accesories and fabrics that add color and texture throughout the home.</P>
<P>As in the single-family home market, active adult homes are becoming more themed.</P>
<P><STRONG>Not Every Buyer Wants to Vacation at Home&nbsp;— But Most Do</STRONG></P>
<P>“Since this is their dream home,” says Newell, “most of these buyers want it to have the relaxed feel of a vacation retreat.”</P>
<P>Ambrosia often incorporates the design and color palates associated with plantation, seaside cottage or Tommy Bahamas interiors to satisfy this desire.</P>
<P>“Of course, we still design models that include traditional, classic and more eclectic interiors, but the vacation feel is very hot right now," Newell says. “We don’t want to get so caught up (in what's hot) that we don't reach the buyer who desires a home with the builder’s more standard amenities.”</P>
<P>For the active adult buyers who would rather spend their money on an actual vacation than a “vacation-feel” home, "we work with the builder to show everything he includes as standard, adding special touches to make the home just as enticing,” Newell says.</P>
<P>Whether merchandising to include the ultimate in what the active adult buyer desires or what they can realistically afford, understanding that the active adult is an individual who continues to participate in the excitement and rigors of everyday life is essential.</P>
