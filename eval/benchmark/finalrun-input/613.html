        Juggling Nursing School and Family</font></strong><br>
        by Diana Bitritto<br>

      <table width="85%" align="center">
        <tr>
          <td><p align="left">Nursing school today attracts many older students 
              who are looking to embark on new career paths. However, these mature 
              students often face challenges not usually encountered by their 
              younger associates, such as work and family.<br>
              <br>
              Juggling nursing school with family responsibilities or a full-time 
              job (usually both) is a difficult and often overwhelming task. The 
              good news is that there's a vast difference between difficult and 
              impossible. This article is intended to help the mature student 
              survive and even thrive on the challenge.</p>
            <p>First of all, flexibility is essential &#8211; and an important 
              part of being a nurse. Kids will fight while you're trying to figure 
              out a care plan. The babysitter may call in sick, your car may break 
              down, or you might have to work overtime on the day of your final 
              exam.</p>
            <p>If you're taking your courses at college, take it slowly &#8211; 
              even one course a semester. You may not have the luxury of having 
              the time to study several courses at once. You may be able to transfer 
              prerequisite college level courses (English, math, or psychology, 
              for example). There's also a program called CLEP, which gives college 
              credit for life experiences, such as work, travel, or independent 
              study.</p>
            <p>The student who works outside the health care field may unfortunately 
              encounter skepticism from classmates and even some instructors. 
              They may challenge you with, &quot;You have it pretty good at your 
              present job. Why do you want to go into nursing?&quot; If you wanted 
              to stay in your present occupation you wouldn't be attending nursing 
              school.</p>
            <p>Many working students are concerned whether or not they should 
              let their boss or co-workers in on their secret. This is a highly 
              individual decision which depends greatly on your work arrangements, 
              how much school will affect your work, and how well you get along 
              with your boss. Bear in mind that a boss's job as well as yours 
              is to act in the best interests of the company. It's easier if your 
              going to school has a minimal impact on your job performance.</p>
            <p>Bear in mind. that a boss's job as well as yours is to act in the 
              best interests of the company. It's easier if your going to school 
              has a minimal impact on your job performance. </p>
            <p>Employers also vary greatly in their flexibility regarding time 
              off. Be creative in using your vacation time. You might need only 
              half a vacation day to attend an extended clinical or you might 
              skip lunch to leave an hour early for last minute exam preparations. 
              Save some vacation time for school activities that might otherwise 
              conflict with your work schedule. Use your lunch hour to study or 
              even to get in a little lab practice if your job is close enough 
              to school.</p>
            <p>Students who are already working in the health care field have 
              a distinct advantage. Not only do they have related experience, 
              but their employer is more likely to be supportive of their educational 
              goals. Every job, however, has attributes that are valuable in nursing. 
              A salesperson or receptionist, for example, needs excellent communications 
              skills to deal with angry or difficult customers. Other positions 
              may require analytical, creative, or critical thinking skills, manual 
              dexterity, mathematical aptitude, attention to details, or the ability 
              to set priorities. all of these skills are desirable qualities for 
              a nurse. Use your job skills to your advantage in your education.</p>
            <p>Going to school will also have a profound impact on your home life. 
              If you pride yourself on keeping an immaculate house, you may need 
              to lower your standards. Family members can vacuum or run the dishwasher, 
              but only you can study for your exams. However, your family might 
              not always give you the support you need. You may come home from 
              clinical to a kitchen sink piled high with dirty dishes, an overflowing 
              laundry hamper, and two chapters you still have to study for tomorrow. 
              If you can afford to hire a cleaning service or send out your laundry, 
              the investment could well be worth it in saved time. Prepared frozen 
              foods are also a real time saver.</p>
            <p>Finally, and most important of all, take time for yourself every 
              day. This point cannot be stressed enough! Even half an hour to 
              enjoy a warm bath, stroll around the block, or read something without 
              the word &quot;nursing&quot; in it can do wonders to refresh you 
              physically, mentally, and emotionally.</p>
            <p>It is encouraging to see more evening nursing programs, but nursing 
              schools need to be more aware of and address the concerns of the 
              student who is trying to balance three different and often conflicting 
              roles. For example, the evening LPN program at our county vocational 
              school runs for two years as compared to one year for the daytime 
              program. It is unrealistic to suggest that working students cut 
              back to part-time or quit altogether. Most of them need the income 
              and benefits until they can get that first nursing job. They might 
              already be concerned about the possibility of having to choose between 
              leaving the job and facing financial hardship in order to complete 
              school or giving up school &#8211; and their dreams. Instructors 
              who treat working students with a little extra patience and emotional 
              support will be rewarded by these who readily give 200% to their 
              nursing studies.</p>
            <p>Even half an hour to enjoy a warm bath, stroll around the block, 
              or read something without the word &quot;nursing&quot; in it can 
              do wonders to refresh you physically, mentally, and emotionally. 
            </p>
            <p>Going to nursing school while having to work and care for a family 
              requires stamina, self-discipline, resourcefulness, and dedication, 
              all of which are prerequisites for being a nurse. The demands are 
              numerous on nursing students in their 30s, 40s, or beyond, but their 
              maturity and experience are invaluable assets in helping to meet 
              them. Older students are highly motivated and usually of excellent 
              quality. They bring a wealth of backgrounds, perspectives, and life 
              experiences to enrich the nursing profession.</p>
