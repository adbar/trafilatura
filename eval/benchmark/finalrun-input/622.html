        is an ancient market town located in the North of Shropshire close by
        the English - Welsh Border. Its strategic position as a 'frontier town'
        has given it a turbulent history. Today the town still retains its vital
        function as a market and shopping centre serving North West Shropshire
        and Mid Wales. The narrow passageways link streets whose names conjure
        up images of the past: English Walls, Welsh Walls, The Bailey and the
        Horsemarket. It is a locally important shopping and agricultural centre
        and still retains the intimacy of a rural town serving local people and
        home to a number of specialist and independent shops.<br>
        <br>
        The origins of the town are uncertain although the towns market dates
        back to 1190. The name Oswestry is thought to be a corruption of
        'Oswald's Tree' and the legend that Oswald the Christian King of
        Northumbria fought a great battle against the pagan King of Mercia -
        Penda. Oswald was defeated and killed in the battle. Penda - as a
        warning to others who might challenge his rule - dismembered Oswald's
        body and hung his limbs on the branches of a tree - hence the name 'Oswalds
        Tree'.<br>
        <br>
        Oswestry's first school founded in 1407 is now a Heritage centre and
        holds regular exhibitions of local arts and crafts. The town Tourist
        Information Centre can be found in the same building.<br>
        <br>
        Most of the town centre has been designated a Conservation Area
        conveying a mixture of architectural styles. There are many old timber
        framed houses, for example Llywd Mansion on Cross Street, the Heritage
        Centre, the Blackgate, the Fox Inn and the shops along Beatrice Street.
        Georgian architecture is also represented particularly around St
        Oswald's Church where there are a number of imposing town houses
        complete with grand entrance staircases and front doors.<br>
        <br>
        It has a significant Victorian legacy. Many of the Shop fronts and
        facades, the many terraced houses and churches and railway buildings
        reflect this period.<br>
        <br>
        Oswestry, has a troubled past and was once encircled by town walls which
        is shown on the medieval street plan of a walled town. The Oswestry Town
        Trail leaflet is available from the Heritage Centre and the Tourist
        Information Centre at Mile End and can be used to tour the town's many
        sites of historical interest for example: St Oswald's Church. Cae Glas
        Park, the town's old gates and Castle Bank are just a few of the places
        of interest.<br>
        <br>
        History and Town Records<br>
        Few records survive from before 1674, the year of the charter granted to
        the Town by King Charles II, some deeds, charters, accounts and
        memoranda of the Bailiffs do exist but little else.<br>
        <br>
        From 1674 to 1835 records are plentiful, consisting of minutes of the
        Council, accounts of the Mayor, proceedings of the Quarter Sessions and
        Court of Record, and correspondence and papers relating to the business
        of the Guildhall, the gaol, markets and fairs, and other matters of
        Local Interest.<br>
        <br>
        Post 1835 Oswestry saw was a period of great development. In the late
        1840&#8217;s new Markets were built in the late 1840's and the construction
        of reservoirs followed from the late 1860's to the late 1880's. The
        events were well recorded in the minutes of the Council and its
        committees and numerous bundles of deeds and documents on all and
        sometimes trivial aspects of the administration of Town affairs.<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#00CC00">The Castle</font><br>
        <br>
        Dating to around 1086, the castle L&#8217;oeuvre was recorded in William I&#8217;s
        Domesday Book as being built by Rainald, Sheriff of Shropshire in the
        Hundred of Meresberie, it was once a frontier outpost that saw both
        Welsh and Anglo Saxon mix together prior to the Norman conquest.<br>
        <br>
        The earliest reference to the town was recorded 1272 and the settlement
        of Blancminster, which derives from its white stone church. The Welsh
        refer to a &#8216;Creos Oswallt&#8217; in 1254, and an obvious link with St.
        Oswald, the Northumbrian King who was killed at the nearby Battle of
        Maeserfelth in 641 AD. Regardless, it is generally accepted that
        Oswestry was once a strong Welsh settlement and the Castle had a role of
        domination to subdue Welsh resistance.<br>
        <br>
        Following the conquest, the region was granted to Roger de Montgomerie
        by William I. This passed to Rainald who is attributed as having built
        the first castle. Then came Alan Fitzlaad, descendant to the mighty
        Fitzalans and later to become the Lords of Arundel and Clun.<br>
        <br>
        The Civil War between Stephen and Matilda saw William Fitzalan I join
        forces with Matilda and he was forced to give up the castle and its
        area. The Welsh appear to have taken this chance to reclaim what they
        once lost and the occupation of the castle by Madoc ap Maerdudd the
        Prince of Powys, between 1149 and 1157, along with the Lordship of the
        area followed.<br>
        <br>
        The accession of Henry II saw the Fitzalan&#8217;s recover their estate, but
        they failed to establish a peaceful reign and troubled times followed.
        There was significant conflict between the Welsh and the English, which
        saw the area and its castle sacked numerous times. In 1165, Henry II
        adopted it as a base for his campaign against Owain Gwynned and in 1211,
        it was used by King John in his war against Llewlyn Fawr.<br>
        <br>
        By 1270 the castle&#8217;s walls embraced the town. In the 14th Century one
        Owain Glyndwr attempted to establish himself as the rightful Prince of
        Wales and throughout this period the town became recognised as a
        strategic trading point. For example, the Short Charter granted by
        William III at the end of the 12th Century awarded the area similar
        customs and liberties as the larger and already prosperous Shrewsbury.<br>
        <br>
        A second charter in 1263 followed and in 1399 it received a Royal
        Charter. Despite this, it remained a fully fortified military base and
        this function continued for many years.<br>
        <br>
        The outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 revived its status as a military
        stronghold and it was once more strengthened to some degree, following
        the town&#8217;s declaration of support for Charles I, and prepared for
        hostility. In June 1644 the castle was under the control of Colonel
        Edward Lloyd of Llanforda. It was laid to siege by Thomas Mytton of
        Halston Hall (near Whittington) who was soon joined by the earl of
        Denbigh. The town gates were battered into submission by cannon and
        infiltrated by troops who rapidly descended upon the castle,
        surrounding. The following day, &#8216;Buttars,&#8217; a kind of early grenade,
        were used to storm the gates and the royalist troops surrendered.<br>
        <br>
        Following the Civil War, Oswestry Castle were rendered uninhabitable as
        part of a campaign to quash further resistance and it was reduced to a
        simple collection of stones.<br>

        just to the North of the town. It was started over 2500 years ago.
        Nowadays, only the Earthworks remain, but it's worth a visit. It can be
        seen from the A5 going North out of the town. It is maintained by
        English Heritage<br>

        which goes from Prestatyn to Chepstow along the Welsh border, passes
        about 3 miles to the west of Oswestry. It is a well maintained footpath
        (some other paths in the area are not so good) and can be picked up at
        many points in the area. The path follows an ancient earthwork which is
        thought to have been a defensive dyke built by the Saxon King Offa .<br>
