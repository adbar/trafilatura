<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Topic:</font><font size=+2>
Penguins</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>What can we learn about
penguins through research, experimentation, observation, design projects
and problem solving?</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>The following unit provides
5 detailed learning experiences and a list of additional activities that
explore the life cycle and habitat of a variety of penguins. This unit
was designed for second grade but can be easily modified for any elementary
level class. The unit took approximately 5 to 6 weeks to cover. Although
all areas of the curriculum were involved, the focus was on math, science
and technology. The culmination of this unit was a special "Penguin Program".
Parents and special guests were invited to see a production, which involved
songs, poems, a reader’s theater and a geography presentation involving
Beanie Babies. I then presented a Power Point Program which allowed the
guests to see an outline of the unit and pictures of the various activities
and experiments that the students had taken part in.</font></font></b>

<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+2>Title: "How Do Penguins
Measure Up?"</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Learning Context:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">NYS Standards:</font></b>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Social Studies Standard #3- Geography</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Objectives:</font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will research a particular
penguin species to find out its average height as well as three other facts
about that penguin.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will use a variety of tools
to measure the height of their penguin on paper and then draw and color
a picture of that penguin showing its characteristics.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will then use the information
that they have gathered to create a graph that shows the height of the
penguin species. They will also answer questions based on that graph.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order for the students to succeed with
this learning experience they must enter into it with some prior knowledge.
The students should show some competency with the following skills:</font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Differentiating between a fact and an opinion</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Measuring, using an inch or centimeter
ruler, yardstick or tape measure</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Interpreting information using a bar graph
or pictograph</font></b></li>
</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Procedure:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Match students up with a partner. Assign
a specific species to each pair, or let them draw a name of the species
from a hat.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distribute books or photocopies to each
pair so that they can research their penguin (see appendix for references).
If you have a computer lab, and appropriate software is available, try
researching the species through the use of technology.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Supply each pair with a long sheet of butcher
block, or similar paper.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Give each pair of students a checklist
(see attached), so that they know exactly what criteria must be met in
order to have an acceptable project.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Poll the students to find out the height
of their species. List this information on chart paper. Then, supply the
students with graph paper so that they can transfer this information into
graph form. The students then create questions that can be answered by
using the graph.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Instructional/Environmental
Modifications:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to meet the needs
of a hearing impaired student in my class, I always wear a Phonic Ear Device.
This helps the student filter out background noise and concentrate more
on my voice. When the students broke up into their groups I then attached
the Phonic Ear Device to the child’s partner so that they could communicate
better. For a visually impaired student other modifications should be considered.
The writing paper the students use to record their facts may need to be
enlarged and the middle, dotted line can be highlighted in yellow.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I also found that it was necessary to
alter the physical setting of my classroom. We pushed back the students'
desks to make a large, open floor space. This allowed the students to spread
out their papers and measure and draw more comfortably. I also allowed
a different group to work out in the hall each day.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Time Required:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prior to beginning this learning
experience, I spent about an hour in the school and local public library
collecting appropriate children’s books and magazines on penguins. I allotted
a 45-minute period each day for one week for the children to complete and
report on this experience. I was able to assess the students' work each
day by making observations and keeping notes. I also assessed their final
project when they made their presentations on the fifth day.</font></b></blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Resources:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Various reference
books on penguins, crayons or markers</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Software for referencing, writing paper,
pencils</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Butcher block paper</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Various measuring tools (inch and centimeter
rulers, yardsticks, or measuring tapes)</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Assessment Plan:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At the beginning of this experience
the students were given a checklist (please see attached) to use as a guide.
The list helped them to keep track of all the steps they had to complete
to have an acceptable project. The students were also given the opportunity
to critique each other’s work. After each group presented their final project
the other students described what they liked best about the project and/or
made suggestions on how to make the project "even better". Some groups
opted to put these suggestions to use while others did not.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While the students worked in their groups
each day, I went around and made observations and kept notes on how the
students interacted with one another. I also made assessments when the
groups made their final presentations.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Student Work: (Please See
Attached)</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Reflection:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I chose to develop this learning experience
because it integrated many curriculum areas and provided the students with
the opportunity to work together, cooperatively, in small groups. The students
really enjoyed this experience and looked forward to working on it everyday.
I found the use of a checklist to be beneficial and will incorporate it
into more lessons in the future.</font></b>

</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">In order for the
students to succeed in this learning experience they must have some prior
knowledge. They must show some competency with the following skills:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Telling temperature
to the nearest degree (Celsius or Fahrenheit)</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Understanding of

</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Procedure:</font></font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Present the class
with a whole group lesson on how to use the Internet to locate a specific
web site and then determine if it provides the necessary information. Guide
the class through the process of bookmarking the site.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Pair up the students.
Whenever an opportunity arises (we did this first thing in the morning)
allow the partners to access the web site and record the temperature for
their town, as well as the temperature in an area of Antarctica (we used
Vostok). The information can be recorded on the attached sheet.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The students must
then compare the two recorded temperatures and determine which area is
experiencing colder weather. This is also recorded on the data sheet.</font></font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Finally, the students
will color in a thermometer to visually display the temperature.</font></font></b></li>
</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Instructional/Environmental
Modifications:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">In order to do
a whole group lesson on using the Internet, I took my class to the computer
lab so that each student could have a computer in front of him/her. If
you have access to the Internet through a computer in the classroom, then
that computer could be used along with a LCD or video projector.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The hearing impaired
student in my class had no problems with this lesson since use of the computer
headphones was not required. For visually impaired students, the teacher
may want to consider the use of transparent, colored, highlighter tape.
This tape can be placed directly on the monitor screen to highlight the
information the students are locating.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Time
Required:</font></font></font></b>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><b>This learning
experience was implemented with the help of a student teacher who was a
great deal more computer literate than I was at the time. She spent about
an hour locating</b> <b>weather web sites and scanning through them to
see which one would provide us with the appropriate information. She then
spent about a half an hour teaching me how to get into the web sites and
how to bookmark them.</b></font></font>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">This experience
took about two weeks to finish. Each morning my student teacher took two
children to the classroom next door to access the web sites, and record
the information. They then returned to our room to make comparisons, color
in the thermometers, and discuss what they had learned. In all, it required
about 15-20 minutes. I led the rest of the class through the morning opening
exercises at the same time. After each child had a turn working on the
computer and recording data, we discussed our findings in a whole group
lesson. We spent a 45- minute period posting the information on a bulletin
board and drawing conclusions based on our data.</font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Resources:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">A Computer with

<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Assessment
Plan:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">The teachers made
observations each day when working with a pair of students on the computer.
A rubric (see attached) was then used to determine the students' level
of competency. The student’s math skills were assessed by the success they
had with the temperature recording sheets they filled in. The two recording
sheets should be compared to make sure that the information coincides.
Small group discussions also enable the teacher to assess the student’s
ability to draw conclusions based on the information they had discovered.</font></font></b>

Work: Please see attached.</font></font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000"><font size=+1>Reflection:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">Although I was
very pleased with the student’s performances during this learning experience,
I must admit I was a little hesitant at the beginning due to a lack of
"computer knowledge" on my part. I was forced to learn some new skills
for which I am now very grateful.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000000">I don’t think
it would be possible to carry out this learning experience unless you have
another adult in the room, whether it’s a teacher’s aide, student teacher
or a parent volunteer. I think it’s very important to work in small groups
and you must have someone by the computer at all times to make sure the
students are accessing the information correctly.</font></font></b>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will create and solve their

the problem.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will practice keyboarding
by typing their word problems on the computer.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Upon beginning this learning experience,
it is helpful, but not necessary, for the students to know how to properly
handle manipulatives. Rules should be established and "free play" time
should be given so that the students can explore the manipulatives before
they are asked to use them as a problem solving strategy.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Procedure:</font></font></b>
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distribute storyboards (see attached) so
the students can color and personalize them.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distribute a bag of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish
to each student and allow time to explore and play.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Use the overhead projector to display a
copy of the storyboard on a large screen. Present the students with a word
problem that they can solve by using the goldfish as manipulatives.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Model the process on the overhead.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As the students get more comfortable with
this problem solving strategy, increase the level of difficulty of the
word problems</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After discussing the strategies used for
problem solving, pass out writing paper and challenge the students to come
up with their own word problems. You may wish to post the problems you
solved together as models for the students to refer to. Depending on their
ability level, some students may copy the problem and only change the numbers;
others will create their own problems.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Conference with the students and edit the
problems as needed. Then, allow the students the opportunity to type their
word problem on the computer and print it.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, distribute a variety of construction
paper, scissors and glue and have the students design their own storyboard
that illustrates the word problem that they created.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When all the storyboards and word problems
are complete, post them in the hall or on a bulletin board. Give the students
an opportunity to choose a classmate’s problem and solve it in their math
journals. The students should also include a journal entry describing why
they chose that particular problem.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Instructional/Environmental
Modifications:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was necessary for me to
use a Phonic Ear Device so that a hearing impaired student could participate
in the learning experience.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Once the students began work on their
own projects, I separated them into groups according to their math skills
and their ability to work independently.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Time Required:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This learning experience took
several days to implement. I used two 45-minute periods to introduce and
practice problem solving through the use of manipulatives and storyboards.
Once the students were comfortable with this skill we spent the next 4
days (45-minutes to an hour) writing problems, creating storyboards and
printing the problems on the computer. Since the assessment was on going,
I did not have to allot extra time for reviewing student work.</font></b></blockquote>

were made during whole group and small group instruction. The students'
demonstrated the level of difficulty they were comfortable with as they
began to create their own word problems. Observations were made and notes
were taken during conferencing times in which the students explained what
problem they created and how they got the answer. Some students needed
more coaching then others, but everyone had an acceptable storyboard by
the end of the learning experience.</font></b></blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Procedure:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Create a Venn Diagram with the students
that compare whales and Emperor penguins. Discuss what similarities they
share and the characteristics that enable them to survive in their environments.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distribute the attached worksheet and give
the students the opportunity to brainstorm about the new concepts that
they have discovered about penguins and other Antarctic creatures.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Display a variety of materials (see materials
list for ideas) on a worktable. Encourage students to give other suggestions
as well.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Allow students to work individually or
in pairs to create their Antarctic Adaptable Creature.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, provide the students with the
opportunity to introduce the creature to the class and describe what features
it has that would enable it to live in Antarctica.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Instructional/Environmental
Modifications:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For visually impaired students, the
teacher may wish to enlarge the Venn diagram and questionnaire. It may
also be helpful to print these pages on contrasting paper. I used a Phonic
Ear Device during whole group instruction to meet the needs of a hearing
impaired student.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I found it necessary to reconfigure
the furniture in my classroom for this learning experience. I used one
large table in the back of the room to hold all the craft materials the
students used for creating their creatures. The students spread newspaper
over their desks since they were using clay. I used a small table in the
front of the room to conference with the students. Here, we discussed the
answers to their questionnaires before they began creating with materials.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Time Required:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Prior to beginning this learning experience,
I took 2 days to inventory my craft supplies and then spent an afternoon
at Wal-Mart stocking up on some necessary items.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We spent a 45-minute period completing
and discussing the Venn diagram. The next day, the students used their
"Independent Work" period to complete their questionnaire and drawing.
After sharing their ideas with their classmates (a 45-minute session) the
students made some alterations to their design projects. Finally, we spent
about 45-minutes to an hour actually creating the creatures with craft
materials.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If some students finished early they
were directed to make a mate or baby for their creature.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Resources:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Venn Diagram worksheet (see
attached)</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Design Worksheet (see attached)</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Craft materials – modeling clay (assorted
colors), pipe cleaners, googly eyes, toothpicks, feathers, etc.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Assorted boxes to create dioramas for
the creatures</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Assessment Plan:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>I found that
with this technology/design project I used a more informal assessment plan.
By looking at their questionnaires and discussing their responses at conference
time I was able to determine how much information the students understood
and were able to apply to this design project. The final product was also
a good indicator of their level of understanding.</font></font></b></blockquote>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Reflection:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although I have done similar lessons,
this was my first attempt at a formal technology/design project. I was
gratified to see that the students were extremely creative and gave their
projects a great deal of thought. I was surprised that some students did
not want to alter their "Antarctic Adaptable Animal" even though others
had pointed out some flaws in their design. For example, one student chose
to use pink feathers and another student informed her that pink would not
be a good color to use for camouflage in Antarctica. The student said that
she didn’t care, she liked pink!</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some students got so caught up in this
experience that they took it a step further and wrote puppet shows for
their creatures.</font></b>

<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MST Standard #1- Analysis, Inquiry, and

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">MST Standard #4- Science</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Objectives:</font></b>
<ul>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will explore the uses of blubber
and explain its purpose for a penguin.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will successfully follow directions
to perform an experiment.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students will make predictions based
on prior knowledge.</font></b></li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is not necessary for the students to
have any specific prior knowledge in order for this learning experience
to be successful. If you incorporate cooperative learning groups into the
experience be sure that each student knows what he/she is responsible for.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Procedure:</font></font></b>
<blockquote>
<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Pair the students or make small groups
of three or four. Give each group a tray of materials and a bucket of cold
water with ice cubes.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Ask students what facts we might find out
about penguins using the materials on the table and the bucket of ice water.
List predictions on the board or a chart.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Have the students take turns and instruct
one team member to put on a surgical glove. Have another student place
five or six tablespoons of solid shortening into a small resealable plastic
bag and "mush" it up.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Next, the student with the surgical glove
places his/her hand into the resealable plastic bag with the shortening.
Another team member will then place a rubberband around the student’s wrist
to secure the top of the plastic bag.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The student with the blubber glove will
now plunge both the blubber glove hand as well as his/her unprotected hand
into the ice water. The other team members will time how long the student
can keep each hand in the bucket of water. Allow each team member to experience
this activity.</font></b></li>

<li>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Finally, discuss the differences the students
felt when they had both hands in the water. Ask the students to explain
why it was easier to keep the blubber glove hand in the water longer. Ask
the students how this experiment is related to penguins.</font></b></li>

<p><br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Instructional/Environmental
Modifications:</font></font></b>
<blockquote><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In order to do conduct this
learning experience I used our science lab. The set up is more conducive
to working with cooperative learning groups and there is a sink with running
water. This experience could be carried out in the classroom but it would
require greater preparation.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I used a Phonic Ear Device to meet the
needs of a hearing impaired student.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Time Required:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I spent about 20 minutes setting up
the science lab prior to this lesson. I spent about a half an hour collecting
and organizing materials. The learning experience itself required about
45-minutes. Assessment was on going throughout the lesson.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Resources:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For each pair of students you will need:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2 small plastic surgical gloves (or
in place of the gloves, use 2 more resealable plastic bags)</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2 plastic resealable bags</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1 pound of solid vegetable shortening
(such as Crisco)</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2 rubberbands</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a stop watch</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a bucket of water with ice cubes</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Assessment Plan:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The students tried to figure out what
we were going to do based on the materials set up in the lab. We made a
list of possibilities and altered the list as the experience continued.
The students asked questions and tried to answer them as we went along.
I was able to assess their level of understanding based on the types of
questions they asked and the conclusions they drew during the experience.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size=+1>Reflection:</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This experience was based on a similar
lesson my student teacher had taken part in during an undergraduate course.
We altered it somewhat to meet our needs. We also changed it so that the
students were always making inquiries and trying to find out how the experience
related to penguins. It didn’t take them long!</font></b>
