        face="Arial,Geneva,Helvetica"><b>T</b></font>he history
        of performance appraisal is quite brief.&nbsp;Its roots in the
        early 20th century can be traced to Taylor's pioneering
        Time and Motion studies. But this is not very helpful,
        for the same may be said about almost everything in the
        field of modern human resources management.<br>
        <br>
        As a distinct and formal management procedure used in the
        evaluation of work performance, appraisal really dates
        from the time of the Second World War - not more than 60
        years ago.<br>
        <br>
        Yet in a broader sense, the practice of
        appraisal is a very ancient art. In the scale of things
        historical, it might well lay claim to being the world's
        second oldest profession!<br>
          <br>
        There is, says <a href="dulewicz.htm">Dulewicz
        (1989)</a>, &quot;... a basic human
        tendency to make judgements about those one is working
        with, as well as about oneself.&quot; Appraisal, it
        seems, is both inevitable and universal. In the
        absence of a carefully structured system of appraisal,
        people will tend to judge the work performance of others, including subordinates,
          naturally, informally and arbitrarily.</font>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">The human inclination to judge can create serious
        motivational, ethical and legal problems in the
        workplace. Without a structured appraisal system, there
        is little chance of ensuring that the judgements made
        will be lawful, fair, defensible and accurate.<br>
        <br>
        Performance appraisal systems began as simple methods of
        income justification. That is, appraisal was used to
        decide whether or not the salary or wage of an individual
        employee was justified.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">The
        process was firmly linked to material outcomes. If an
        employee's performance was found to be less than ideal, a
        cut in pay would follow. On the other hand, if their
        performance was better than the supervisor expected, a
        pay rise was in order.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">Little
        consideration, if any, was given to the developmental
        possibilities of appraisal. If was felt that a cut in
        pay, or a rise, should provide the only required impetus
        for an employee to either improve or continue to perform
        well. <br>
        <br>
        Sometimes this basic system succeeded in getting the
        results that were intended; but more often than not, it
        failed.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">For
        example, early motivational researchers were aware that
        different people with roughly equal work abilities could
        be paid the same amount of money and yet have quite
        different levels of motivation and performance.<br>
        <br>
        These observations were confirmed in empirical studies.
        Pay rates were important, yes; but they were not the only
        element that had an impact on employee performance. It
        was found that other issues, such as morale and
        self-esteem, could also have a major influence.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">As
        a result, the traditional emphasis on reward outcomes was
        progressively rejected. In the 1950s in the United
        States, the potential usefulness of appraisal as tool for
        motivation and development was gradually recognized. The
        general model of performance appraisal, as it is known
        today, began from that time.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="BULLET.GIF" width="6" height="6" align="middle"><b>&nbsp;Modern
        Appraisal <br>
        </b>Performance appraisal may
        be defined as a structured formal interaction between a
        subordinate and supervisor, that usually takes the form
        of a periodic interview (annual or semi-annual), in which
        the work performance of the subordinate is examined and
        discussed, with a view to identifying weaknesses and
        strengths as well as opportunities for improvement and
        skills development.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">In
        many organizations - but not all - appraisal results are
        used, either directly or indirectly, to help determine
        reward outcomes. That is, the appraisal results are used
        to identify the better performing employees who should
        get the majority of available merit pay increases,
        bonuses, and promotions.<br>
        <br>
        By the same token, appraisal results are used to identify
        the poorer performers who may require some form of counseling, or in extreme cases, demotion, dismissal or
        decreases in pay. (Organizations need to be aware of laws
        in their country that might restrict their capacity to
        dismiss employees or decrease pay.)<br>
        <br>
        Whether this is an appropriate use of performance
        appraisal - the assignment and justification of rewards
        and penalties - is a very uncertain and contentious
        matter.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="BULLET.GIF" width="6" height="6" align="middle"><b>&nbsp;Controversy,
        Controversy<br>
        </b>Few issues in management
        stir up more controversy than performance appraisal.<br>
        <br>
        There are many reputable sources - researchers,
        management commentators, psychometricians - who have
        expressed doubts about the validity and reliability of
        the performance appraisal process. Some have even suggested that
        the process is so inherently flawed that it may be
        impossible to perfect it (see <a href="derven1.htm">Derven,
        1990</a>, for example).<br>
        <br>
        At the other extreme, there are many strong advocates of
        performance appraisal. Some view it as potentially
        &quot;... the most crucial aspect of organizational
        life&quot; (<a href="lawrie1.htm">Lawrie,
        1990</a>).</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">Between
        these two extremes lie various schools of belief. While
        all endorse the use of performance appraisal, there are many
        different opinions on how and when to apply it. <br>
        <br>
        There are those, for instance, who believe that
        performance appraisal has many important employee
        development uses, but scorn any attempt to link the
        process to reward outcomes - such as pay rises and
        promotions.<br>
        <br>
        This group believes that the linkage to reward outcomes
        reduces or eliminates the developmental value of
        appraisals. Rather than an opportunity for constructive
        review and encouragement, the reward-linked process is
        perceived as judgmental, punitive and harrowing.<br>
        <br>
        For example, how many people would gladly admit their
        work problems if, at the same time, they knew that their
        next pay rise or a much-wanted promotion was riding on an
        appraisal result? Very likely, in that situation, many
        people would deny or downplay their weaknesses.<br>
        <br>
        Nor is the desire to distort or deny the truth confined
        to the person being appraised. Many appraisers feel
        uncomfortable with the combined role of judge and
        executioner.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">Such
        reluctance is not difficult to understand. Appraisers
        often know their appraisees well, and are typically in a
        direct subordinate-supervisor relationship. They work
        together on a daily basis and may, at times, mix
        socially. Suggesting that a subordinate needs to brush up
        on certain work skills is one thing; giving an appraisal
        result that has the direct effect of negating a promotion
        is another.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">The
        result can be resentment and serious morale damage,
        leading to workplace disruption, soured relationships and
        productivity declines.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">On
        the other hand, there is a strong rival argument which
        claims that performance appraisal must unequivocally be
        linked to reward outcomes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">The
        advocates of this approach say that organizations must
        have a process by which rewards - which are not an
        unlimited resource - may be openly and fairly distributed
        to those most deserving on the basis of merit, effort and
        results.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">There
        is a critical need for remunerative justice in
        organizations. Performance appraisal - whatever its
        practical flaws - is the only process available to help
        achieve fair, decent and consistent reward outcomes.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">It
        has also been claimed that appraisees themselves are
        inclined to believe that appraisal results should be
        linked directly to reward outcomes - and are suspicious
        and disappointed when told this is not the case. Rather
        than feeling relieved, appraisees may suspect that they
        are not being told the whole truth, or that the appraisal
        process is a sham and waste of time.
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="BULLET.GIF" width="6" height="6" align="middle"><b>&nbsp;The Link
        to Rewards<br>
        </b>Recent research (<a
        href="bannist.htm">Bannister &amp; Balkin,
        1990)</a> has reported that
        appraisees seem to have greater acceptance of the
        appraisal process, and feel more satisfied with it, when
        the process is directly linked to rewards. Such findings
        are a serious challenge to those who feel that appraisal
        results and reward outcomes must be strictly isolated
        from each other.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">There
        is also a group who argues that the evaluation of
        employees for reward purposes, and frank communication
        with them about their performance, are part of the basic
        responsibilities of management. The practice of not
        discussing reward issues while appraising performance is,
        say critics, based on inconsistent and muddled ideas of
        motivation.</font></p>
        <p><font face="arial,helvetica,geneva">In
        many organizations, this inconsistency is aggravated by
        the practice of having separate wage and salary reviews,
        in which merit rises and bonuses are decided arbitrarily,
        and often secretly, by supervisors and managers.<br>
