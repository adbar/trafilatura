                  </p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The effective 
                    business, Peter Drucker observes, focuses on opportunities 
                    rather than problems. How this focus is achieved in order 
                    to make the organization prosper and grow is the subject of 
                    this companion to his classic, The Practice of Management. 
                    The earlier book was chiefly concerned with how management 
                    functions; this volume shows what the executive decision-maker 
                    must do to move his enterprise forward. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One of 
                    the notable accomplishments of this book is its combining 
                    specific economic analysis with a grasp of the entrepreneurial 
                    force in business prosperity. For though it discusses "what 
                    to do" more than Drucker's previous works, the book stresses 
                    the qualitative aspect of enterprise: every successful business 
                    requires a goal and spirit all its own. Peter Drucker again 
                    employs his particular genius for breaking through conventional 
                    outlooks and opening up new perspectives--for profits and 
                    growth. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Excerpt:</b></font></p>
                  <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b>Business 
                    Realities</b></font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">That executives 
                    give neither sufficient time nor sufficient thought to the 
                    future is a universal complaint. Every executive voices it 
                    when he talks about his own working day and when he talks 
                    or writes to his associates. It is a recurrent theme in the 
                    articles and in the books on management.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">It is 
                    a valid complaint. Executives should spend more time and thought 
                    on the future of their business. They also should spend more 
                    time and thought on a good many other things, their social 
                    and community responsibilities for instance. Both they and 
                    their businesses pay a stiff penalty for these neglects. And 
                    yet, to complain that executives spend so little time on the 
                    work of tomorrow is futile. The neglect of the future is only 
                    a symptom; the executive slights tomorrow because he cannot 
                    get ahead of today. That too is a symptom. The real disease 
                    is the absence of any foundation of knowledge and system for 
                    tackling the economic tasks in business.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Today's 
                    job takes all the executive's time, as a rule; yet it is seldom 
                    done well. Few managers are greatly impressed with their own 
                    performance in the immediate tasks. They feel themselves caught 
                    in a "rat race," and managed by whatever the mailboy dumps 
                    into their "in" tray. They know that crash programs which 
                    attempt to "solve" this or that particular "urgent" problem 
                    rarely achieve right and lasting results. And yet, they rush 
                    from one crash program to the next. Worse still, they known 
                    that the same problems recur again and again, no matter how 
                    many times they are "solved."</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Before 
                    an executive can think of tackling the future, he must be 
                    able therefore to dispose of the challenges of today in less 
                    time and with greater impact and permanence. For this he needs 
                    a systematic approach to today's job.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There 
                    are three different dimensions to the economic task: (1)The 
                    present business must be made effective; (2) its potential 
                    must be identified and realized; (3) it must be made into 
                    a different business for a different future. Each task requires 
                    a distinct approach. Each asks different questions. Each comes 
                    out with different conclusions. Yet they are inseparable. 
                    All three have to be done at the same time: today. All three 
                    have to be carried out with the same organization, the same 
                    resources of men, knowledge, and money, and in the same entrepreneurial 
                    process. The future is not going to be made tomorrow; it is 
                    being made today, and largely by the decisions and actions 
                    taken with respect to the tasks of today. Conversely, what 
                    is being done to bring about the future directly affects the 
                    present. The tasks overlap. They require one unified strategy. 
                    Otherwise, they cannot really get done at all.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">To tackle 
                    any one of these jobs, let alone all three together, requires 
                    an understanding of the true realities of the business as 
                    an economic system, of its capacity for economic performance, 
                    and of the relationship between available resources and possible 
                    results. Otherwise, there is no alternative to the "rat race." 
                    This understanding never comes ready-made; it has to be developed 
                    separately for each business. Yet the assumptions and expectations 
                    that underlie it are largely common. Businesses are different, 
                    but business is much the same, regardless of size and structure, 
                    of products, technology and markets, of culture and managerial 
                    competence. There is a common business reality.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">There 
                    are actually two sets of generalizations that apply to most 
                    businesses most of the time: one with respect to the results 
                    and resources of a business, one with respect to its efforts. 
                    Together they lead to a number of conclusions regarding the 
                    nature and direction of the entrepreneurial job.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Most of 
                    these assumptions will sound plausible, perhaps even familiar 
                    , to most businessmen, but few businessmen ever pun them together 
                    into a coherent whole. Few draw action conclusions from them, 
                    no matter how much each individual statement agrees with their 
                    experience and knowledge. As a result, few executives base 
                    their actions on these, their own assumptions and expectations.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">1. <i>Neither 
                    results nor resources exist inside the business.</i> Both 
                    exist outside. There are no profit centers within the business; 
                    there are only cost centers. The only thing one can say with 
                    certainty about any business activity, whether engineering 
                    or selling, manufacturing or accounting, is that it consumes 
                    efforts and thereby incurs costs. Whether it contributes to 
                    results remains to be seen.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Results 
                    depend not on anybody within the business nor on anything 
                    within the control of the business. They depend on somebody 
                    outside--the customer in a market economy, the political authorities 
                    in a controlled economy. It is always somebody outside who 
                    decides whether the efforts of a business become economic 
                    results or whether they become so much waste and scrap.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The same 
                    is true of the one and only distinct resource of any business: 
                    knowledge. Other resources, money or physical equipment, for 
                    instance, do not confer any distinction. What does make a 
                    business distinct and what is its peculiar resource is its 
                    ability to use knowledge of all kinds--from scientific and 
                    technical knowledge to social, economic, and managerial knowledge. 
                    It is only in respect to knowledge that a business can be 
                    distinct, can therefore produce something that has a value 
                    in the market place.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Yet knowledge 
                    is not a business resource. It is a universal social resource. 
                    It cannot be kept a secret for any length of time. "What one 
                    man has done, another man can always do again" is old and 
                    profound wisdom. The one decisive resource of business, therefore, 
                    is as much outside of the business as are business results.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Indeed, 
                    business can be defined as a process that converts an outside 
                    resource, namely knowledge, into outside results, namely economic 
                    values.</font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">2. <i>Results 
                    are obtained by exploiting opportunities, not by solving problems.</i> 
                    All one can hope to get by solving a problem is to restore 
                    normality. All one can hope, at best, is to eliminate a restriction 
                    on the capacity of the business to obtain results. The results 
                    themselves must come from the exploitation of opportunities.
