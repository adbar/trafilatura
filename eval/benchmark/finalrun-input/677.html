                    up with plant roots for 500 million years. Now available at 
                    garden centres, these can greatly benefit your plants, explains

                  <p>It is probably fair to say that, to most gardeners, fungi 
                    are an anathema. Whether turning the leaves of roses yellow 
                    and black, appearing in rings in a manicured lawn or, horror 
                    of horrors, as <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Armillaria</em> (honey fungus) 
                    rampaging through a garden&#8217;s trees, moulds are costly 
                    nightmares.</p>
                  <p>Think again. In the wild, more than 95 percent of higher 
                    plant species not only harbour fungi in their roots, they 
                    actually supply them with sugars and other foods. In return, 
                    the fungi furnish the plants with raw materials - water and 
                    nutrients from which food substances are synthesised - and 
                    protect them from soil-borne diseases. The relationship is 
                    therefore of benefit to both: a symbiosis.</p>
                  <p>The close association of the roots of trees with certain 
                    fungi was described as long ago as 1885, by German forester 
                    AB Frank. The name for the association, mycorrhiza, literally 
                    means &#8216;fungus root&#8217;. It is only within the last 
                    30 years, however, that scientists have begun to realise that 
                    far from being the exception, such relationships are actually 
                    the norm in the plant kingdom.</p>
                  <p>The fungal partner&#8217;s network of thin tubes, or hyphae, 
                    are much more efficient at absorbing both water and nutrients 
                    than even the thinnest root hairs, as hyphae have a much bigger 
                    surface area. Under less-than-ideal conditions, studies have 
                    shown that the efficiency of mycorrhizal roots can make the 
                    difference between life and death. Plants with mycorrhizal 
                    root systems are better able to resist stresses such as drought, 
                    heat, and even diseases - many mycorrhizal fungi secrete antibiotics, 
                    protecting roots from pathogenic fungi such as <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Phytophthora</em> 
                    and <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Armillaria</em>, nematodes and bacteria.</p>
                  <h4>Structures and functions</h4>
                  <p>There are two main types of mycorrhizal fungi, associated 
                    with different plant species. On trees, the most common type 
                    is known as ectomycorrhizae or EM, as most of its structure 
                    is outside the root, often forming a visible sheath over its 
                    surface. Hyphae also grow inside the root between the cells, 
                    forming a characteristic structure known as a Hartig net, 
                    and most EM fungi also produce fruiting structures like mushrooms 
                    and puffballs.</p>
                  <p>The other major type, endomycorrhizae, have most of their 
                    structure inside the root. Also known as arbuscular mycorrhizae 
                    or AM, these are more primitive fungi than the EM type, making 
                    up only 150 of the estimated 6,000 mycorrhizal fungi species. 
                    However, AM is the predominant type, found on 65 percent of 
                    plant families, including grasses, herbaceous plants and woody 
                    species, with most colonising a wide range of plants. The 
                    branches of the tree-like structures - the arbuscules - that 
                    AM fungi produce have a large surface area across which the 
                    plant and fungus can exchange substances to the benefit of 
                    both. This occurs inside the root but outside individual cell 
                    membranes.</p>
                  <p>Their microscopic structure makes AM fungi difficult to see 
                    and they do not form above-ground fruiting bodies, but more 
                    than 90 percent of vascular plants are thought to associate 
                    regularly with them. They send out thin hyphae into the soil 
                    that actively mobilise nutrients (particularly insoluble phosphates 
                    that are often the limiting factor in plant growth) from dead 
                    organic material and the soil&#8217;s mineral fraction.</p>
                  <h4>Working with nature</h4>
                  <p>The early attempts of forestry researchers to inoculate young 
                    trees with mycorrhizal fungi of the EM type involved macerating 
                    and liquidising the root systems of &#8216;donor&#8217; trees, 
                    and dipping seedling root systems into the slurry. Results 
                    were patchy, and such preparations had short shelf lives.</p>
                  <p>In the 1980s, EM mycorrhizal fungi were finally cultured 
                    on a commercial scale without host roots, and induced to form 
                    spores. A company called Plant Health Care in the USA was 
                    one of the first to offer a viable mycorrhizal inoculant, 
                    based on the species <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Pisolithus tinctorius</em>, 
                    found on more than 100 species of trees and shrubs worldwide. 
                    Trials by the company produced increased growth rates of up 
                    to 200 percent in the seedlings of several pine species.</p>
                  <p>Since then, research has continued apace with more species 
                    cultured, including the more difficult AM species that are 
                    obligate symbionts (they only grow on host roots). Companies 
                    such as PlantWorks in Kent are now producing formulations 
                    increasingly tailored to different host species and soil conditions. 
                    Many of these now contain both AM and EM fungi, making them 
                    suitable for a wide range of plants. These are beginning to 
                    appear in garden centres, but how useful are they to home 
                    gardeners?</p>
                  <p>The short answer is: it varies, depending on the site, conditions 
                    and plants grown. For plants on poor, disturbed or contaminated 
                    soils, mycorrhizal inoculation can be vital. On the Betteshanger 
                    Colliery shale deposits in Kent, a study by Christ Church 
                    College Canterbury and PlantWorks showed that inoculated birch 
                    seedlings had mortality rates of less than 3 percent, compared 
                    with 60 percent in untreated plants.</p>
                  <p>Mycorrhizal fungi dislike disturbed ground and are not found 
                    in subsoil, so in areas such as gardens of new-build houses 
                    or recent landscaping they are often not present and may not 
                    appear naturally until too late for newly-planted seedlings. 
                    Simply digging over beds or hoeing in a garden can disrupt 
                    existing mycorrhizal relationships.</p>
                  <p>A cycle of negative feedbacks is common in gardens: disturbance 
                    damages the fungal partners of plants, making them less able 
                    to absorb nutrients, so the gardener adds a chemical &#8216;fix&#8217; 
                    of inorganic fertiliser, which is toxic to the fungi, making 
                    them even less able to supply the plant.</p>
                  <p>In organically-managed gardens and areas cultivated for wildlife 
                    interest, in particular, it makes sense to encourage mycorrhizal 
                    growth with early inoculation, minimal digging and mulching 
                    with organic matter that the fungi can break down slowly and 
                    naturally rather than using chemical fertilisers. Plants in 
                    such regimes are much better equipped to resist stresses such 
                    as drought, disease and excess heat - all of which may become 
                    increasingly important as global warming seems set to accelerate.</p>
                  <h4>Application</h4>
                  <table width="100%" >
                    <tr> 
                      <td width="200"><img src="images/microrhiza2.jpg" alt="A gel-based root-dip formulation used in the planting of new woods at RHS Garden Hyde Hall" width="189" height="250" /></td>
                      <td valign="top">A gel-based root-dip formulation containing

                    </tr>
                  </table>
                  <p>Mycorrhizal fungi are most effective in fine, actively growing 
                    fibrous roots, so the initial problem is physically how to 
                    introduce the fungus to these parts of the plant. The simplest 
                    method, now well-established in forestry and landscaping, 
                    is to apply a solution containing the inoculant by dipping 
                    the roots in a liquid or gel formulation (pictured, right). 
                    This technique is only really suitable for dormant, bare-root 
                    woody plants.</p>
                  <p>For pot-grown plants, tablets or powdered formulations can 
                    be mixed into the growing medium. The nursery industry has 
                    been quite slow to take up this method, probably because plants 
                    grown in sterile media and supplied with all their water and 
                    nutrient needs may show little extra growth after inoculation. 
                    While large growth increases have been found in some cases, 
                    results have been mixed. Generally, though, inoculated plants 
                    rarely if ever perform worse than those that have been left 
                    untreated.</p>
                  <p>Treated, pot-grown stock, when planted out and exposed to 
                    soil pathogens for the first time, has been shown to establish 
                    more quickly with better disease-resistance, and thus suffer 
                    less from &#8216;transplant shock&#8217;. </p>

                  <p>Well-established plants including mature trees can also be 
                    inoculated, using a system known as Terravention. This physically 
                    blasts fungal inoculants into the rootball using pressurised 
                    nitrogen gas, and is particularly valuable in areas that are 
                    suffering from soil compaction, as the gas opens up air channels 
                    to some depth. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew reversed the 
                    seemingly-terminal decline of several specimens, including 
                    some of its oldest trees, with Terravention. A <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Platanus 
                    orientalis</em> planted in the original garden in 1761 and 
                    a <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Sophora japonica</em> from 1762 were both 
                    re-invigorated by Terravention in 1997, and a <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Cedrus 
                    deodara</em>, marked for removal since two-thirds of its crown 
                    was completely defoliated, greened-up within months of treatment. 
                    All three continue to recover well.</p>
                  <p>Success at Kew has been repeated at The Savill Garden, Windsor. 
                    Keeper of the Garden Mark Flanagan reports positive results 
                    from Terravention treatment to six important, ancient trees 
                    that were formerly in decline at Frogmore, near Windsor Castle. 
                    The Savill Garden, like Kew, is now inoculating some seedlings 
                    routinely at the pricking-out stage.</p>
                  <p>How much of the improvement shown by such venerable specimens 
                    is due to the soil being better aerated, and how much to the 
                    introduction of fungi, is difficult to quantify. The method 
                    works, and has been used at RHS Garden Hyde Hall (see below).</p>
                  <p>Mycorrhizal inoculation is not suited to every garden situation, 
                    and a few plant families, notably poppies and brassicas, rarely 
                    if ever form such relationships. For well-fed, well-watered 
                    plants, it may be unnecessary, but in many cases mycorrhizal 
                    fungi can act both as growth promoters and insurance policies 
                    against sources of stress (including diseases), contributing 
                    to a more natural, low-intervention, ecological form of gardening.</p>
                  <h4>Mycorrhizae at RHS Gardens</h4>
                  <p>At RHS Garden Hyde Hall in Essex, mycorrhizae-based formulations 
                    have been used in a number of ways. The garden suffered badly 
                    from waterlogging during much of 2000, so Terravention with 
                    inoculation was tried on several of the garden&#8217;s trees 
                    that had been badly affected. Many including a Lebanon cedar, 
                    a bird cherry and a venerable willow seem to have benefited.</p>
                  <p>&#8216;They certainly look a lot healthier,&#8217; says Curator 
                    Matthew Wilson, &#8216;but it&#8217;s impossible to say if 
                    this is the fungi, decompaction, weather or all three.&#8217; 
                    Attempting to quantify the benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation 
                    is inherently difficult because so many other factors affect 
                    the plant-fungus relationship. The best results with mature 
                    trees have been recorded at both the New York Botanic Gardens 
                    and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew where Terravention has been 
                    combined with turf removal under the trees out to their driplines, 
                    and the exposed soil has been mulched heavily.</p>
                  <p>Root dips have been used in the planting of Hyde Hall&#8217;s 
                    new woodland areas, with treated and non-treated seedlings 
                    planted to compare establishment and growth. Matthew describes 
                    the results as &#8216;encouraging&#8217;, but stresses it 
                    is too early to draw conclusions. A recent study at RHS Garden 
                    Wisley, comparing the effect of extra fertiliser and endomycorrhizal 
                    fungi on the resistance of <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Fragaria vesca</em> 
                    (alpine strawberry) to <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Armillaria</em> fungus, 
                    produced mixed results. Inoculation with pure AM <em lang="latin" xml:lang="latin">Glomus 
                    intradices</em> fungus gave the lowest death rates, but a 
                    mycorrhizal formulation for trees produced plants with the 
                    lowest weights. Fertiliser-treated plants were the heaviest.</p>
