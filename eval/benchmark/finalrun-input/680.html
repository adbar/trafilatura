          <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/physician-immigration.asp">Physicians</a> who receive
          clinical medical residency training in the U.S. pursuant to a J-1 exchange
          visitor visa are required to return to their home country for two years
          before they are eligible to apply for an H-1B visa or <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/permanent-residency.html">permanent
          residency</a>. J-1 visa physicians need not complete this two-year home
          requirement if they are approved for a waiver to deliver medical services
          in a designated underserved area or at a VA hospital. In addition, the
          United States Congress, under the leadership of Senator Conrad, has
          mandated that all states (as well as the District of Columbia and certain
          territories, such as Puerto Rico and Guam) may act as interested state
          agencies (<a href="http://www.rlapc.com/state-30.html">State 30</a>
          Program), recommending up to thirty (30) <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/national-interest-waiver.html">national
          interest waivers</a> for J-1 physicians per state each fiscal year.
          These waiver recommendations are available in addition to any VA, ARC
          or DHHS waivers that may be issued for locations within that state.
          Most J-1 Visa Waivers typically require a three year service obligation.
          However, certain states, such as West Virginia, require a four-year
          contractfrom a <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/immigration-firms-in-virginia.html">immigration
          firm in Virginia</a>. All waiver programs require a showing that the
          employer has made efforts to recruit a U.S. physician and a <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/canadian-doctor.html">Canadian
          doctor</a> prior to offering a position to a J-1 physician. </td>

          <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/naturalization.html">Naturalization</a>
          is the process by which permanent residents can obtain U.S. citizenship
          status. In some cases, dual citizenship may be retained. Since naturalized
          citizens share practically all of the same rights as citizens born in
          the United States, this is an important step to take to complete the
          immigration process. Obtaining a J-1 waiver is a three-step process.
          The first step is to obtain a recommendation for a waiver from an interested
          government agency (IGA), like HHS or <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/appalachian-regional-commission.html">Appalachian
          Regional Commission</a>. This recommendation is then forwarded to the
          United States Department of State Waiver Review Division in Washington,
          D.C. (formerly known as the USIA), which in turn issues its recommendation
          to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which provides
          approval of an Application to Waive Foreign Residence Requirements (Form
          I-612). </td>

          Therefore, a hardship waiver application must establish that the U.S.
          citizen or permanent resident spouse and/or child will suffer exceptionally
          as a result of returning to the J-1 visa holder's home country and remaining

          attorneys</a> offer <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/o-1-visa.html">O-1
          visas</a> are temporary nonimmigrant visas, available for highly talented
          or acclaimed individuals in the sciences, education, business or athletics.
          To qualify for an O-1 visa, the applicant must have extraordinary ability
          "demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim." Extraordinary
          ability means a "level of expertise indicating that the person is one
          of that small percentage who has risen to the very top of the field
          of endeavor." The O-1 category is especially helpful to medical researchers
          such as <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/foreign-doctor.html">foreign doctors</a>,
          athletes, and business people who may lack the qualifications or salary
          required for the <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/j-1-waiver.asp">J-1 waiver</a>
          program. In addition, to date, there have been no numerical limitations
          reached on the J-1 program, thereby allowing any number of <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/international-medical-graduate.html">international
          medical graduate</a> applicants to qualify each fiscal year. In order
          to apply for <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/labor-certification.html">Labor
          Certification</a> (LC), an applicant must obtain an employer to sponsor
          him/her through a job offer. The LC process consists of three phases
          leading to permanent residency. The first phase involves obtaining a
          Labor Certification from the Department of Labor (DOL). The second phase
          involves obtaining an <a href="http://www.rlapc.com/immigration-visas.html">immigrant
          visa</a> petition approval from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration
          Services (USCIS) based on the DOL Labor Certification. The third phase
          involves the applicant's application to either adjust status from non-immigrant
          to permanent resident here in the U.S., or obtain an immigrant visa
          at an American Consulate in the home country.</td>
