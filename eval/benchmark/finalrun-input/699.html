Demand of Justice To Make Restitution</span></small><br>
  </big></big><br>
  <big><big><big>More on Wage-Cheating in China </big></big></big><br>
  <br>
At a toy factory in China, a management memo told workers how they
should prepare
for an upcoming inspection by an outside monitoring team. They were to
memorize
false numbers for their wages and working hours, inflating the wages
and lowering the hours in order to reflect standards under Chinese
laws. And
they were promised bonuses for lying to
the inspectors. <br>
  <br>
That is among the revelations contained in a front-page article, "Ruse
in Toyland: Chinese Workers' Hidden Woe," published in the December 7
issue of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/world"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">New York Times</span></a>
as part of its series on "The World's Sweatshop," China.&nbsp; The
article focuses on a
factory near Hong Kong, Kin Ki Industrial, whose 850 workers, mostly
teen-age girls, make the popular Etch A Sketch drawing toys for the
Ohio
Art Company in Bryan, Ohio.<br>
  <br>
Workers at the plant told the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>
reporter, Joseph Kahn, that if the company were to pay legal wages,
their pay for a month would more than double, to about $200 from
$86. A senior Kin Ki executive first disputed these figures, but
after also claiming that the company complies strictly with all
Chinese laws, he acknowledged that its wages and benefits did fall
short
of legal requirements.
Moreover, Kin Ki company documents obtained by the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>, Kahn writes, "show that it
has been
paying below-regulation wages -- and seeking to fool foreign clients --
for years."<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Toy Industry 'Well Aware' of
Law-Breaking, U.S. Industry Chief Says</span><br>
  <br>
If those and other damning facts detailed in the lengthy article were
untrue, they would be challenged by the international toy business'
leading spokesperson, Tom Conley, president of the trade association
once
called the Toy Manufacturers of America, which three years ago renamed
itself the <a href="http://toy-tia.org/template.cfm">Toy
Industry
Association</a> (since 80% of
all toys sold in the United States are manufactured in China). Instead
of disputing Kahn's facts, Conley makes this admission in a letter
published in the December 14 <span style="font-style: italic;">Times</span>:
"The toy industry
is well aware that some Chinese toy factories are not complying with
Chinese laws."<br>
  <br>
So what does he propose to do about the violations, especially those
that cheat workers out of their lawful wages? He offers only an
expanded
program of independent inspections that "leave no room for the kind of
deceit" that the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times </span>has
revealed.&nbsp;
But the problem is not merely deceit but <span
 style="font-style: italic;">cheating</span> -- robbing workers of
their wages <span style="font-style: italic;">over a period of years.</span>&nbsp;
Justice requires making restitution. Conley ignores that demand of
justice. So does the <a
 href="http://www.toy-icti.org/mission/bizpractice.htm">code of conduct</a>
that he extols as "the real
solution" -- the International Council of Toy Industries' Code of
Business Practices. <br>
  <br>
Workers at the unionized plant of the Ohio Art Company in Bryan, Ohio,
made
Etch A
Sketches for 40 years before its owners three years ago decided to move
production to China. One reason, its executives told Kahn, was the
soaring cost of health insurance. In China the Kin Ki production
workers have no health insurance. <br>
  <br>
They also have no union. Last
summer a brief strike caused Kin Ki to raise wages a few cents a
day and improve canteen food slightly, but two strike leaders soon were
no longer on the payroll.&nbsp; According to management, they left
voluntarily. According to workers,&nbsp; management fired them -- made
"fried squid" out of them, in local parlance.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
The toy industry has a long history of highly profitable growth based
on
exploiting young women from China's rural areas. See, for example, "<a
 href="bu2.htm">Our Children Don't Need
Blood-Stained Toys</a>," published in <span style="font-style: italic;">HRFW
  </span>eight years ago, and an article of mine, "<a
 href="http://www.aft.org/american_educator/winter2002/Toy.html">Toying
with Lives</a>,"
published in <span style="font-style: italic;">American Educator</span>
a year ago. For highlights
from a previous Kahn article in the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times
  </span>series, see "<a href="03-12-03.htm">China Is
World's Sweatshop -- Who Cares?</a>" <br>
  <hr width="50%" size="2"> <br>
  <big><big><big>How Killing Workers Goes Unpunished</big></big></big><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-style: italic;">"Workers decapitated on assembly
lines, shredded in machinery, burned
beyond recognition, electrocuted, buried alive -- all of them killed,
investigators concluded, because their employers willfully violated
workplace safety laws."</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
  <br>
Is that a description of avoidable workplace fatalities in China?&nbsp;
No, this is a scandal made in the USA. The deaths happen here at the
rate of 100
workers a year as a result of "intentional wrongdoing or plain
indifference" by employers. And, despite U.S. respect for the rule of
law, the
offending employers are almost never prosecuted. <br>
  <br>
Those are among the startling findings of an intensive <span
 style="font-style: italic;">New York Times </span>investigation that
resulted in what the <span style="font-style: italic;">Times </span>calls
"the first systematic accounting of how this nation confronts
employers who kill workers by deliberately violating workplace safety
laws." A few of the other findings disclosed in a December 22 article
by David Barstow: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Although causing the death of a worker by willfully violating
U.S. occupational safety laws is a federal crime, from 1982 to 2002 the
federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) declined to seek
prosecutions in 93% of the cases in which the agency itself concluded
that the workers had died because of "willful" safety
violations by employers.</li>
    <li>Moreover, repeat offenders got off easy. "Having avoided
prosecution once, at least 70 employers willfully violated safety laws
again, resulting in scores of additional deaths. Even these repeat
violators were rarely prosecuted," Barstow writes.</li>
    <li>In the OSHA bureaucracy "victims' families are frozen out, but
companies adeptly work the rules in their favor." Since 1990 OSHA has
increasingly bowed "to employer demands that it replace the word
'willful' with 'unclassified' in citations involving workplace
deaths...even for employers who have repeatedly shown a deliberate
disregard for safety laws, resulting in multiple deaths."</li>
    <li>In two decades OSHA's enforcement of the law has led to jail
sentences totaling fewer than 30 years. In a single year, 2001, the
Environmental Protection Agency obtained prison sentences totaling 256
years.<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
Barstow's article, part of a series, "When Workers Die," on how the
U.S. government deals with the worst cases of death on the job, is
subtitled
"A Culture of Reluctance."&nbsp; That's an understatement. It is a
culture of cruel indifference and criminal malfeasance.<br>
  <br>

  <hr width="50%" size="2"><br>
  <big><big><big>Which Way To Go, Mr. CEO?</big></big></big> <br>
  <br>
Let's say you are a top management official at Wal-Mart, Nike, or
another major American corporation, and you have come to rely on
workers in the
People's
Republic of China to make a large part of your company's goods and
profits. You used
to deny that your products are made in sweatshops. Now you realize that
the on-site
evidence is undeniable. You face pressure to
make your company "socially responsible."&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
So what to do? You seek guidance
from lawyers and other experts. At root, however, the choices you face
are two, exemplified by
the opposing approaches carefully delineated by two world figures. Here
is
one
approach, capsulized in this quotation:<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
"In [a free] economy, there is one and only one social responsibility
of business -- to use its resources and engage in activities designed
to increase profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game,
which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without
deception or fraud....<br>
  <br>
"Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our
free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social
responsibility other than <span style="font-style: italic;">to make as
much money for their stockholders
as possibl</span>e." -- Milton Friedman, the distinguished professor of
economics, writing in his best-selling book "Capitalism and Freedom"
(page 133, emphasis added).<br>
  </div>
</blockquote>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">I call this the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">not-to-worry</span>
approach. It can be very comforting to sweatshop-plagued corporate
leaders. It tells them, on the authority of a Nobel Prize winner, that
in dedicating themselves to making as much money as possible for their
stockholders they are
doing the right thing and also fighting to keep
our society free. </div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Then, there's another approach,
capsulized in these three propositions:<br>
</div>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>"There exist acts which <span style="font-style: italic;">per
se</span> and in themselves, independently of circumstances, are always
seriously wrong" (that is, prohibited because they are "always
and without exception <span style="font-style: italic;">intrinsically
evil" </span>[emphasis in original]).</li>
    <li>Among such evils are "degrading conditions of work which treat
laborers as mere instruments of profit." <br>
    </li>
    <li>"So long as [such evils] infect human civilization they
contaminate those who inflict them more than those who suffer them" --
Pope John Paul II in his encyclical letter <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Veritatis Splendor </span>(para. 80)<span
 style="font-style: italic;">.&nbsp; </span><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
I call this the <span style="font-style: italic;">you'd <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">better</span>
worry</span> approach. It prohibits treating workers as mere
instruments of
profit. Morally, it places a severe limitation on you even if the
existing rules
of the game do not. <br>
  <br>
It's your choice, Mr. CEO.&nbsp; Which approach will you take?<br>
  <hr width="50%" size="2"><br>
  <big><big><big><a name="global"></a>Global Norms Put Heat on Business</big></big></big><br>
  <br>
The United Nations Commission on Human Rights will soon consider
adopting a set of "<a
 href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/links/norms-Aug2003.html">Norms
on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations</a>" covering
environmental, labor, and human rights standards. The U.S. Council for
International Business, very much in character, is vigorously opposing
them.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
The proposed norms, which will be on the agenda of the Human Rights
Commission's annual meeting in March, were adopted by a subsidiary unit
of the
Commission in August, and since then they have provoked sharp
controversy
between its proponents and business representatives, often
in the pages of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Financial
Times</span>.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
In a <a href="http://www.uscib.org/index.asp?DocumentID=2804">letter</a>
published in that London-based newspaper on December 17, Thomas M.T.
Niles, president of the U.S. Council, objected to the
norms because, if approved, they would "create a new international
legal framework,
cutting across virtually every area of business operations, with
companies, rather than the governments that negotiated them,
responsible for implementing international treaties and
conventions." Besides, the norms are unnecessary because "most
companies are already [taking human rights seriously]."<br>
  <br>
In a response published December 19, also in the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Financial Times</span>,
Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland, former UN High Commissioner
for Human Rights, and now
executive director of the <a href="http://www.eginitiative.org">Ethical
Globalization Initiative</a>, wrote: <br>
  <br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Mr. Niles is right to say that many
companies are committed to respecting human rights....But Mr. Niles
goes too far in suggesting that this is common practice. The great
majority of companies around the world have not thought carefully about
their responsibilities in relation to human rights.<br>
  <br>
"A recent survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development found that only one in five has adopted codes of conduct or
shares compliance information with the public. Few companies even
mention human rights in their codes of conduct.&nbsp; Far
fewer...employ third-party reporting systems. In more extreme cases,
companies are directly responsible for, and complicit in, violations of
rights, as recent expert reports of the UN Security Council on the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources
and Other Sources of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo </span>clearly
show." <br>
  </div>
  <br>
Breaking ranks from business opposition, seven companies, including
ABB, Novartis, and Barclays, have publicly stated their intentions to
"give serious consideration to the role these norms might play in their
own work," according to the new Business Leaders'
Initiative on Human Rights. Mrs. Robinson, who chairs that group,
expressed confidence
that there would be "a steady increase in the number of companies that
look seriously at international human rights standards when making
decisions about their operating methods, personnel policies,
procurement, and investment decisions."<br>
  <br>
Is that optimism justified?&nbsp; It depends on many factors,
including (but not only) the position of the U.S. government, which is
one of 53 government members of the UN Human
Rights Commission.&nbsp; The Bush administration is hardly an advocate
of expanding international obligations in the area of human rights,
labor, and the environment, and relies heavily on the views of
organizations like the U.S. Council for International Business.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">Counseling the Council on Why To
Take the High Ground</span><br>
  <br>
The U.S. Council has not sought my advice, but here it is anyway: <br>
  <ul>
    <li>The norms draft does indeed contain a very broad set of
(non-binding) obligations, mostly
reflecting and clarifying standards that already exist in many
international treaties and conventions. But it is only a draft, and
subject to revision. Instead of battling to bury the norms and all
they represent, you would be wise to use the Council's influence to
make the
norms workable and to render them conducive to promoting corporate
social responsibility. <br>
    </li>
    <li>The bad apples, which you know exist, spoil the reputation of
all business. Worse, they spoil the business environment by inclining
others to follow their example. All too often, this
corrupting process goes on under a polite name: <span
 style="font-style: italic;">meeting
the
competition</span>.</li>
    <li>Governments actively protect the rights and interests of
business not only through domestic legislation but more and more
through a network of international law and intergovernmental
organizations. But there is a huge void in international safeguards
that
protect the rights and interests of labor. As global integration
intensifies, and global communications increase, that void becomes more
and more difficult to ignore,
and more and more difficult to justify. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Don't underestimate Mrs. Mary Robinson and the
power of the idea she is promoting. Business' heavy dependence on the
protection of international law and intergovernmental organizations
while vigorously opposing those benefits to others is increasingly
being recognized as selfish, unbalanced, unfair, and untenable.<br>
    </li>
    <li>Some businesses agree that they have the opportunity to do much
more to advance human rights, and in many other businesses there are
executives who understand this opportunity and would like to seize it.
You ought to join them instead of fighting them. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
(Unfortunately, the Website of the <a
 href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu2/2/chr.htm">U.N.
Commission on Human Rights</a> and the unit that approved the norms,
its Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, is
not user-friendly. The subcommission member who is most
responsible for drafting the norms, and whose eight years on the
subcommission end in March, <a
 href="http://www.law.umn.edu/FacultyProfiles/WeissbrodtD.htm">David
S. Weissbrodt</a>, professor
of law at the University of Minnesota, has
made <a href="http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/links/norms-Aug2003.html">the
draft norms</a> available on the university
Website. For background information, see the Website of the <a
 href="http://www.business-humanrights.org/Home">Business and Human
Rights Resource Centre</a> and the current Human Rights Brief published
by the Washington College of Law.)<br>
  <hr width="50%" size="4"><br>
  <big><big><big>Diary: So Far, No Dumb Mistakes</big></big></big><br>
  <br>
Breakfast finished, Mai, who will be three at the end of February, was
wiggling to leave her highchair. "Hold on," my wife said. "I'll
unplug
you."<br>
  <br>
"No, Grandma," Mai insisted. "<span style="font-style: italic;">Unbuckle</span>
me. Unbuckle, please."<br>
  <br>
At her present pace, in a few short years Mai should be ready to
copyread each edition of <span style="font-style: italic;">Human
Rights for Workers </span>before I publish it on the Web. I live in
muted dread that I'll go final with a text that has some dumb mistakes.
I make use of two kinds of spell checkers, and they catch most of my
typos. Careful reading, and rereading, catches others, the ones that
the mechanical systems miss.<br>
  <br>
But spell checkers are blind to factual errors. Like the one I
made the other day in the annual Christmas letter I wrote early in
December. In
describing the family Christmas eve that we would
celebrate at our son's house in nearby Ashburn, Virginia, I located it
"close to where Lee crossed the Potomac, only to get beaten
at Gettysburg."&nbsp; After most of the letters were in the mail, I got
an uneasy feeling about that sentence. I decided to check a map.
Of course, Lee's army was actually defeated at <a
 href="http://www.nps.gov/anti/home.htm">Antietam</a>, after crossing
the Potomac much farther upriver than I had said. Embarrassing errors,
which would be far more embarrassing if they had gone out over the Web.
  <br>
  <br>
I launched <span style="font-style: italic;">Human Rights for Workers</span>
in February 1996. During those eight years, an occasional typo or
punctuation error has slipped through, but (to my knowledge) no really
dumb mistake of substance. I'll try to continue that record in
the next eight years. But the sooner I get Mai's help the better.<br>
  <div style="text-align: center;">* * *<br>

My wife Dzung edits a Vietnamese literary magazine, Co Thom, which,
loosely translated into English, means "fragrant grass," a poetic
Vietnamese expression symbolizing the cultural basis of the quarterly
publication.&nbsp; Co Thom promotes Vietnamese literary, artistic, and
human values, and has been doing so for eight years now, thanks to
volunteer help and donations from Vietnamese-Americans who want to keep
the Vietnamese language alive among the many Vietnamese who fled their
native land to escape Communism.&nbsp; <br>
  <br>
After serving as the magazine's editor for three years, Dzung has just
been named its publisher too, which among other things means promoting
subscriptions ($30 a year).&nbsp; If you read Vietnamese, and want to
subscribe (as you really should), send me an <a
