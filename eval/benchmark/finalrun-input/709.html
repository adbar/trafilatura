You have found the <a href="http://www.slidescanning.com/service.htm?s=indexbody" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline"> one-stop-shopping-site</a> for converting all of your irreplaceable memories to digital format.   And, we believe that this will be your last stop in your journey to find a high quality professional source for your <a href="http://www.slidescanning.com/slide-scanning.htm?s=indexbody" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">35mm slide</a> film and <a href="http://www.slidescanning.com/negative-scanning.htm?s=indexbody" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">35mm negative</a> film scanning needs.  <br><br>In addition to our "industry best" slide scanning and film scanning, we also provide:<br><br><a href="http://www.slidescanning.com/vhs-2-dvd.htm?s=indexbody" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline">Video Tape (VHS, VHS-C, Hi8, & 8mm digital tape transfer to DVD)</a>, and<br><br>

We understand the value of your film and we also know this should be a once in a lifetime expenditure.  We promise to take care of your film as if it was our own treasured memories.  And we will do everything in our power to ensure that the quality is unsurpassed so that we never have an  unsatisfied customer.   Nobody has more experience in scanning slides than we do.  We just passed the "4 million slides scanned" milepost this year.<br>
<br>
When it comes right down to it -- there are 4 main reasons why you should select a particular company to digitize your valuable and irreplaceable family memories.<br>
<br>
1. A reputation for quality and customer satisfaction is number one.  We pride ourselves in our track record since we started business back in 1995. We have always made sure that each and every one of our customers are treated with professionalism along with a personal touch.<br>
<br>
2. State of the art equipment is a must and we use nothing but the finest scanners available on the market today.  All mounted film (slides &amp; negatives) is scanned with Nikon Coolscan 5000 ED scanners with Digital ICE (infra-red film surface dust and defect elimination technology).  We use the finest equipment and processes for our film  transfers to DVD.<br>
<br>
3. A broad range of options to choose from.  We have tried to bring as many options as possible to our customers.  We have options to fit the needs of everyone from professional photographers to the hobbyist, and to the family history and genealogy buff.<br>
<br>
4. And finally -- Cost.  We believe that cost should be the final decision maker after the other three.  Fortunately for you, our costs are as low as or in almost every case substantially lower than our competitors.<br>
<br>
We convert your slides and negatives into industry standard&nbsp;<br>
TIFF ( tif ) or JPEG ( jpg ) image files, not proprietary formats such as Kodak's PictureCD or PhotoCD.  With Kodak's proprietary formats,  you are limited to the usefulness, ability to copy, and compatibility with your software.   There has never been a better time for transferring slides to
DVD.<br>
This is a great opportunity to pass your precious memories to your kids and their kids.<br><br>
So take your time -- look around our web site. You'll agree that THESE ARE the best values around!

I can't believe what you did, it is so far beyond our expectations!   What was lost - appears to have been found!  I called my wife to see, &amp; together we shed nostalgic tears of joy! Thank you so much.<br>

I wanted you to know that I am very pleased with the results of your work on my very old slides and negatives.  Most of these slides were 30 to 40 years old and the memories are priceless. I now have CD copies and have shared these with my family and some friends. You probably already know, but let me remind you, that the result of your work can make many people very, very happy.<br>
<br>
I was able to give photos of children and their parents (now deceased) that those children (now parents themselves) had not seen, and certainly did not remember that they even existed.   Can't beat that!<br>
<br>
Thanks again.<br>

Received Disc's and slides in good condition. I reviewed all Discs and photos and was very satisfied with the results.  I know the slides were not in the best of conditions (As they had survived two hurricanes) but were very well received on the Disc. Thanks for the good Job.<br>

I just received my order and I am totally flabbergasted. I did not expect these old slides -- some dating back to 1941 or 1942-- to look so good! They are truly remarkable! The colors are so vivid and the images so sharp they look like they were taken yesterday with a high-end digital camera (or, at least, by someone who's a better photographer than I).&nbsp;<br>
An excellent job! Thank you!<br>

I want to thank you for the work you did converting my slides. In addition you responded very well to the missing slide transfers in my order by regenerating the disk and sending me a free slide show. Making an error wasn’t nearly as important as how you responded to it and the way you corrected it. You have a fine company, good people and deliver an excellent product. Your work is an important part of a 5 generation family pictorial that I’m putting together. Thanks again, and continued success. You will always have my enthusiastic endorsement.<br>

I wanted to commend you on doing such a superb job on my Dad's very old slides (1940's-1950's). I know there were a lot of slides and several I am sure had bad mounts, all requiring your attention. I suspect the Digital ICE took a lot of time as well. The results speak for themselves. Almost as good as new! Your attention to detail in maintaining order among those 1,900 image files was excellent! Thank you for a job very well done! My ailing 90 year old dad is going to be so surprised to see these slides after who knows how many years!!!!<br>

Congratulations to you all.  The slides came today, and we are so happy.  They are beautiful to see on our computer.  We haven't been able to really look at them since we junked the old projector 20 years ago.

The work you did was fantastic; everyone that has seen the video has been really impressed. We couldn't believe the slides were so clear and the music you added brought back many memories. (My husband) was also very touched by the song at the end and I liked the way you flashed the shots of (My husband) back on the screen.<br>
<br>
People that have seen the video have asked how I found someone like you. Isn't strange how there can be a connection between complete strangers? I knew you had your heart in this with the first email you sent telling me what you were doing with the slides. It was evident you put a lot of thought and heart into the video and we appreciate your work very much. If you need to use me as a reference, please do.<br>

I am the Communications coordinator for the Department of Neurosurgery at LSU Health Sciences Center in Shreveport, Louisiana. Among my responsibilities includes overseeing the transition of many departmental materials to digital format for presentations' access via database, and storage. This includes coordinating the digitization of our existing store of some 10,000 patient neuroimaging studies, which have been routinely stored as photo slides over the last eight to ten years. After viewing their web presence, speaking personally about our needs' and completing a formalized bid process, Larsen Scanning Service was selected to implement this initiative.<br>
As we near the halfway point in this slide digitization process, I can say that we in the Department of Neurosurgery have been quite pleased with the performance and professionalism of this scanning service. Not only are they able to handle the considerable volume of slides in a timely fashion, but the application of the digital cleaning system has resulted in slides that have been digitally restored to new likeness, at times in spite of significant debris and wear to the slide.<br>
With new sets returning to us on a regular basis, I can safely state that Larsen Scanning Service is readily capable to handle high quality scanning projects on a large scale with pleasing results. We look forward to continuing our digitization process with this company, and recommend them to companies or individuals seeking to preserve their stores of photo slides.&nbsp;<br>
Kindest regards,<br>
