          and more recently <i>Dark Side of the Moon </i> won many awards, including 
          several for engineering, on its way to being one of the best-know albums 
          of all time. The author, who engineered these and many other sessions

        <p align="left"><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many years ago, in the earlier 
          part of their career, Pink Floyd had been experimenting with a device 
          inscrutably known as the Azimuth Coordinator. It was not a magic box 
          for aligning type machine heads as the name might suggest but a very 
          glorified term for what we now know as a quad pan pot. Its use at live 
          concerts at that time very likely inspired considerable audience interest 
          in multichannel sound systems and in a mild way may have contributed 
          towards the now booming industry of quadraphony. Many groups have recently 
          adopted quadraphonic pa systems for live shows, the size and power of 
          which seem to be increasing. Quadraphonic record sales are also on the 
          increase, despite the indecision both on the part of the public and 
          record companies about which of the various systems provide the best 
          results and compatibility.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="FourSidesFloydSetup.html" target="_top"><img src="gif/FloydSetup250.gif" width="250" height="207" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>Practically
           all non-classical recordings are made using close mic techniques in
           relatively dead studio acoustics and later premixed to a stereo master
           tape. Exactly the same recording procedures can apply for a quadraphonic
           record except that, because the master reduction is made to four channels
           rather than two, the multitrack layout must allow an effective distribution
           of sounds for adapting to quad. There are obviously more possible
          positions  in a four channel remix, and conflict may arise with track
          groupings  organized with stereo on mind. Although Dark Side of the
          Moon was monitored  in studios equipped for stereo reproduction, many
          sections were recorded  with regard to the eventual quadraphonic reduction,
          even though this  took more track space than would have been necessary
          for stereo. For  example, the clock sounds for Time were built in an
          imaginary quad picture  on to four tracks of the 16 track master. The
          sounds heard on the introduction  to <i>Money</i> were also distributed
          across four tracks to enable the  spatial shifts of the quad reduction.
          This involved transfer from an  edited tape loop on a four track machine
          to the 16 track for subsequent  overdubs so that each sound issued
          from a different speaker.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        </font><p align="left"><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Merely redistributing the sound 
          for the quad mix, however, is not the end of the story. The various 
          quad systems for which the album is intended have to be </font>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">borne
          in mind. EMI have adopted the SQ system for disc issues. As with all
          matrix systems it has specific limitations. For example, if signals
          are positioned anywhere in the area between centre-of-the-roon and
          center back they are likely to be out of phase to some degree when
          encoded and cut in two disc channels. This results in a considerable
          drop in level, due to the difference channel limitations or even a
          total disappearance of the signal in mono, so this has to be avoided
          wherever possible, although a pan through this center area might pass
          unnoticed since level variations would be less objectionable in a moving
          picture.<br>
          <br>
          When approaching the quad mix of the album it had to be emphasized
          that the contents should be unchanged musically, but be a &#145;showcase&#146; for
          the quad medium and avoid the more obvious gimmicks of panning etc.
          The requirements were a discrete master for tape systems, and an encoded
          SQ master for disc transfer. It was thought that two separate remixes
          would be the ideal situation, for in that case each system could be
          used o its fullest capabilities without compromise on account of the
          other. However, there might have been such huge differences in quad
          effect between the two that they might have been incompatible with
          each other musically; for example, in the effect of following disc
          and tape cartridge.</font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        </font><p align="left"><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Another considered alternative
                was to remix to discrete and SQ simultaneously. This would have
                presented a considerable demand on machinery, especially as many
                other tape machines would be in use for quad echo delay, automatic
                double-tracking (a technique using a fast delay) and so on. Every
                edit would then </font>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">have
                to be duplicated on both systems; crossfades would be a nightmare,
                needed three four track machines and three stereo machines quite
                apart from the extra time involved and the multiplication of
                lineup procedures. It was eventually decided to work with one
                discrete four track tape and monitor it in such a way that assured
                a reasonable result for both systems, in other words bearing
                in mind the compromises in the subsequent two-channel processing.
                The quad remix room at EMI&#146;s Abbey Road Studios
                has the convenient facility to monitor a discrete tape passed
                through a back-to-back SQ encode/decode arrangement, and also
                the stereo result direct from the two matrix channels without
                decoding. Thus, we can monitor discrete, SQ and stereo from just
                one four track tape. An SQ master was to be prepared simply by
                making a copy of the final edited and crusaded four track tape
                through the SQ encoder. This extra generation could be saved
                if it was felt necessary by direct transfer from an advance head
                four track machine to disc via an encoder, although normal practice
                is to prepare an intermediate two channel tape: azimuth and generation
                difficulties can be overcome by careful engineering. Having determined
                the manner in which the various systems could be handled for
                the reduction, the problem of quad positioning arose.<br>
                <br>
                On the stereo version the basic instrument positions were arranged
as in fig. 1 Additional sounds such as synthesizers, extra guitars
and backing vocals were spread across the picture in various combinations
for maximum filling out of the music stage. The stereo remix was by
no means a simple one, many tracks having to be &#145;potted&#146; for 
          just a bar or two. The 16 track master itself was derived from an earlier 
          16 (down to nine or ten tracks on the second in some cases) in order 
          to make spare tracks available for further overdubs. This did not make 
          the quad picture &#145;design&#146; any easier. For instance, the drums
          had been mixed to stereo on the second generation 16 track which, owing
          to SQ limitations, had to be spread from left to front right, leaving
          bass drum and snare center front and tom toms spread in stereo across
          the front of the room. The bass guitar also had to remain center front
          for the sake of the SQ, but this was no great problem as bass frequencies
          have little directional characteristics and the harmonics and attack
          of the instrument are not particularly strong here. Guitar was placed
          rear left and the electric piano rear right.<br>
          <br>
          The reverberation system used throughout the quad reduction was two
          EMT reverb plates: one was spread across the front channels and one
          across the rear &#150; both fed from the same source. This gave a very 
          full &#145;inside the chamber effect&#146; and helped to minimize the 
          &#145;hole in the middle of the room&#146; caused by the absence of
          direct sounds there.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="FourSidesFloydQuad.html" target="_top"><img src="gif/FloydQuad210.gif" width="210" height="213" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>The
          piano on<i> The Great Gig in the Sky</i> is a natural quad recording
          made in Abbey Road Studio One (while bass and drums were playing simultaneously
          in Two) using two distant microphones for back channel reverberation.
          The four tracks were simply combined for the stereo version. <br>
          In <i>Time</i> the roto-toms (tom-toms tuned by rotating drums on a
          pivot to stretch the head) were spread across the back channels while
          most of the remaining instruments were distributed across the front.
          The recording technique and studio layout for the basic backing tracks
          were nothing especially unusual except that maximum possible separation
          was attempted. Poor separation for a quad remix of this type could
          probe very disturbing. This was no problem in most cases, as many instruments
          were overdubbed rather than laid down on the basic track. The Kepex
          system was used as a noise gate on all the 16 tracks for the reduction,
          and also in the earlier stages to improve separation between individual
          drums on the basic recording. Further use of Kepex enabled decay times
          of various tracks to be altered; the heartbeat on the introduction
          to the album was, in fact, a Kepexed bass drum.<br>
          <br>
          The positioning for quad remix was effected by means of an external
          insertion unit containing sixteen dual-concentric pan pots (front to
          back and left to right). These were then fed into channel faders on
          the mixing console in the normal way. Any movement or panning was arranged
          by patching in external joystick panpots to the appropriate tracks
          and then again returned to channel faders.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="FourSidesFloydDelays.html" target="_top"><img src="gif/FloydDelays250.gif" width="250" height="112" align="right" border="0"></a><i>Us
           and Them</i> is probably the most involved piece of quad technique
          on the album. On the stereo version a vocal line is repeated by means
          of a very long tape echo which moves from the left towards the right
          on each successive repeat. In order to achieve an interesting effect
          in quad, each repeat was returned to a different channel which entailed
          using a different tape system for each repeat rather than recycling
          one signal back through the same system, as one would for a normal
          tape echo or digital loop. In order to do this a hookup had to be arranged,
          with an eight track machine as in fig. 3. </font></p>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
        </font><p align="left"><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It will be noted that each repeat 
          involves two record-replay stages. This was necessary to attain the 
          length of delay needed for the piece and in fact to </font>
        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"></font><font color="#663300" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">increase
          the delay still further the tape speed of the machine was lowered.
          By the time the fourth repeat had arrived about four seconds after
          the original signal it had passed through eight stages of tape, so
          machine and Dolby line up were extremely critical. This caused troubles:
          originally, the record/replay equalization was accurately set, as usual,
          but the relatively slight speed deviation meant that, at the changed
          speed, slight top lift occurred. After eight repetitions this became
          rather unusable. It will also be noticed that the repeat from track
          eight is fed back into the record stage of track one so that a further
          cycle takes place. Thus: fifth repeat returns left front, sixth right
          front and so on. The result is a round-and-round-the-room effect. The
          system is operated below unity gain however, and the sixth and seventh
          repeats are barely audible.<br>
          <br>
          A similar type of delay is used in <i>Any Color You Like</i> on synthesizers.
          Richard Wright, when overdubbing on to the section, heard the tape
          repeat in earphones, and played in such a way that the result was canonic.<br>
          Owing to the sheer complexity of some of the procedures involved in
          the recording of Dark Side, many of the sounds would be impossible
          to reproduce live, even with the most involved equipment. It is for
          this reason that Pink Floyd use a number of prerecorded tapes, reproduced
          in quad on a Teac four track machine, for their concert programs. The
          tape is operated at the mixing desk which is situated within the hall
          in the audience area. One unusual point about the quadraphonic layout
          for Floyd concerts can be seen in fig. 4. Rather than use a conventional
          double stereo set up, ie front left, right front, left back and right
          back, the whole system is rotated 45º. This has many advantages over
          a normal system.<br>
          <br>
          The main stereo pa is extremely large and powerful (approve 8 kW).
          To set up an equally powerful system at the rear corners of a concert
          hall would be a mammoth task, and very impractical. Even with the layout
          shown, road crews have a hard time humping huge cabinets to the sides
          and back of the hall, especially when the auditorium is on several
          levels. This involves speaker stacks on every level together with their
          associated cables, which have to be kept out of the way of the audience.<br>
          <br>
          It has been found very effective to have the quad output stacks on
          a level somewhat above that of the stage, especially since the system
          is used frequently to simulate movement.<br>
          This applies more especially to the stack behind the stage, of course,
          which in most cases would be drowned by the more powerful independent
          stereo stage pa. The stage quad stack also serves as an aural cue to
          the band, who might otherwise find it difficult to hear the other quad
          channels, which could literally be hundreds of feet away from the stage.<br>
          <br>
          Any attempt to duplicate the quad picture from the recorded version
          would be disastrous. The delay from front to back in a large hall could
          be as much as half a second, and in tight rhythmic sections this would
          be very unpleasant to listen to, quite apart from the band finding
          timekeeping very difficult with their own sound coming back at them
          from al directions with various erratic degrees of delay.<br>
          <br>
          <a href="FourSidesFloydStereo.html" target="_top"><img src="gif/FloydStereo250.gif" width="250" height="197" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5" border="0"></a>Thus,
          the quad system for a live hall has to be used in a rather subtle manner,
          the aim being in this case to add impact at relevant points in the
          piece being performed. In the long introduction to <i>Dark Side</i>,
          the heart beat fades on slowly as the house lights dim and synthesizers
          and voices swirl around the hall. In one of the Floyd&#146;s old favorites
          the effect is slightly less subtle: in <i>Careful With That Axe Eugene</i> the
          quad carries no sound at all until the famous horrific scream at which
          every amplifier and speaker is driven to its absolute maximum, accompanied
          by an explosion of flash powder behind the stage.<br>
          <br>
          Any individual instrument carrying a microphone to the mixing console
          can be individually switched into the quad system. This is used to
          the most advantage on quiet passages where the main stereo pa can be
          virtually shut down and the maximum use made of quad pan pots for movement.<br>
          <br>
          With domestic quadraphonic systems, seating position is very important.
          In a concert hall, however, this is not as critical owing to the greater
          distances involved between channels. It is an unfortunate fact, however,
          that some unlucky concert goers have to sit directly underneath a quad
          stack and get themselves deafened &#150; which is as good a reason
          as any for not using the quad too much throughout the concert. In the
          film Earthquake the noise issues from huge cabinets at both ends of
          the theater, and the author was unlucky enough to find himself sitting
          near one of the rear stacks at a showing in the West End. <br>
          <br>
          Pink Floyd have recently used back projected film behind the stage
          with a 35 mm four channel sound track. This has proved very successful
          but problems do arise with run-up-times of up to ten seconds when attempting
          to bring in a sound on a musical cue. Film and multichannel sound are
          now commonplace of course, as in the new Ken Russell picture of <i>Tommy</i> and
          its use of a &#145;quintophonic&#146; system &#150; doubtless an 
          indication of things to come. </font></p>

    Four sides and four quadraphonic systems, this double album released in 1975
     had identical musical sides which differed only in their quadraphonic surround
     system. The music varied from Pink Floyd's <i>Money </i> to a special remix

      went  and died on us.</font></p>
