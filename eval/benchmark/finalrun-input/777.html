      <font face="Frutiger Linotype">
      <font size="+2"><b>T</b></font>his is the time of year that the warm
      weather is waning, you begin to notice the smell of burning leaves and
      ripening apples. The clear cool breeze is on your face first thing in the
      morning, and the children have new energy and interest in the season.
      Autumn is here and isn't it beautiful? A time for harvesting, canning,
      preserving and getting stocked up for winter -- and the perfect time for
      reflecting on the many things for which we should be thankful.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> I number among these: God,
      our family, our home, our love and our great country. We have indeed been
      blessed in this country, as were our forefathers and the early celebrants
      of that first Thanksgiving in America -- both the Pilgrims and the Indians
      that shared the meal and celebration together. At our house, we use this
      time of gratitude and counting our blessings to study that first
      Thanksgiving as an integral part of our homeschool studies.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> As with any unit study topic,
      I try to pick out all of the important subtopics, crossing the curriculum
      spectrum many times. For example, when studying Thanksgiving, there is
      plenty of historical information to examine, along with geography (ocean
      crossings, continents, climates), science (plant varieties, growth,
      propagation, some of the sicknesses of the time, animal life in the
      region), art (N.C. Wyeth's paintings, clothing of the time, crafts), and
      reading (both fiction and nonfiction books).<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> When I first began preparing
      a unit study on Thanksgiving, I had the incorrect notion that my
      understanding of that period of American history was fairly complete. I
      was certainly proven wrong as we progressed through our study! I had not
      realized the extent of the sacrifice made by the Pilgrims over that 13
      year period, traveling to Holland for years, and then finally returning
      to England to take part in the colonization of America. I never really
      knew or understood the origin of the &quot;King James&quot; version of the
      Bible and how it was connected to the Separatists.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> Each year, we focus on
      different aspects of the event. This year, we will take a look at what was
      involved in their survival in a new land -- when we started making our
      list of what we would do if we were the Pilgrims, my son chimed in
      &quot;find a Walmart!&quot; The reality of being in the middle of nowhere
      to maintain your religious beliefs, giving up what was so familiar and
      comfortable to go to an unknown destiny was pretty amazing to them. This
      was exactly the concept that I wanted them to understand -- <b>that
      sacrifices are oftentimes made for what you believe in, and to trust in
      the Lord to lead and protect you.</b><br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> As we work our way through
      <font color="#0000FF"><b><a href="../thanksgiving.htm">this study</a></b></font>, we have many, many activities and studies that we enjoy. For
      example, a popular question has been over the difference in Indian corn
      and table corn, as we know it. This opens the door to an opportunity to
      help them learn more about the differences in plant varieties and about
      the gardening practices of both the Pilgrims and the Indians.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> Not only are we looking at
      some of their survival gardening, we are also trying to get a better
      understanding of what types of shelter they built, what kinds of sickness
      they had to deal with and why we don't have those illnesses today. There
      are many aspects of their daily living that we can't easily relate to from
      our own experience, and it is important for the children to
      &quot;see&quot; what life was like then, the tools they used, the things
      they did without, the responsibilities of each family member, and the
      importance of their faith and trust in God to provide for their needs.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> One of the books that opened
      my eyes to a broader view of the politics and history of the Pilgrims'
      journeys was <em>Saga of the Pilgrims: From Europe to the New World</em>,
      by John Harris (published by Globe Pequot Press). This book, written for
      the seventh grade and up, is very interesting reading and certainly
      presented a new perspective on these religious outcasts. I recommend that
      both parents and the older children read this one -- it is a very
      informative and interesting book to share and discuss. For the younger
      children, a comparable book might be <em>If You Sailed on the Mayflower in
      1620</em>, by Ann McGovern (published by Scholastic).<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> As we study the Pilgrims and
      the people involved in this &quot;new beginning&quot;, the characters of
      the people and some of the flavor of their hopes and dreams, ideas, work
      ethic, and humor come to light, and are appreciated by those involved in
      the study. When their first winter is reflected upon, one can't help but
      feel the loss of so many loved ones on a personal level.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> The resourcefulness and
      foresight of these religious outcasts helped lay some secure and strong
      foundations for our country. When they took the time and painstaking
      effort to write and bring to acceptance the Mayflower Compact, they
      unknowingly developed the long-lasting concept of freedoms and rights that
      we Americans enjoy and expect. People tend to develop a much deeper
      appreciation of these freedoms when they get some hands-on exposure to
      just exactly what prices have been paid to obtain and protect those
      freedoms, and it is my goal that this study will help the children develop
      a solid understanding and appreciation of these principles and ideals.<br>
      <img border="0" hspace="10" src="../images/clear.gif" width="1" height="1"> As you begin a unit study
      about Thanksgiving, try to include as many interesting books and
      activities as possible. Consider writing to the living history museum,
      Plimoth Plantation, for additional materials and ideas. Their address is
      Plimoth Plantation, Public Relations Department, P.O. Box 1620, Plymouth,
      MA 02360. If you cannot visit Plimoth Plantation in person (some of us
      live a bit FAR to do that!), there is a video that many libraries carry
      titled: <b>&quot;Plimoth Plantation: A Visit&quot;</b>, produced by
      VideoTours in their History Collection.<br>

      Enjoy this season of giving thanks and bringing the harvest home. There is
      so much to be thankful for, and as homeschoolers, we have even more to be
      thankful for -- the chance to really know our children and walk the walk
      with them, sharing and caring and motivating and learning beside them.
      Enjoy the adventure, and may you and your family be abundantly blessed!</font><p align="center">
