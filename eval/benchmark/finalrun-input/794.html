                of State of the European Union <br>
                <span class="body1">by Lord Yehudi Menuhin, May 6, 1997</span></p>
              <p>T<span class="body1">he following letter to Heads of State of 
                the European Union, calling for the creation of a European Cultural 
                Assembly, was sent by Lord Yehudi Menuhin, the great violinist, 
                conductor, and humanitarian who received the Nuclear Age Peace 
                Foundation's 1997 Distinguished Peace Leadership Award. </span></p>
              <p class="body1"><br>
                In my opinion there is one element missing in the general concept 
                of the European Union -- It is the representation of the rich 
                diversity of European Cultures.</p>
              <p class="body1">The peoples aspiring to national sovereignty must 
                be offered the alternative of cultural autonomy. We cannot afford 
                a proliferation of atom bombs and terrorists, nor can we deny 
                any group its own distinctive identity, its needs, traditions 
                and habitat.</p>
              <p class="body1">The powers of globalization in science, in communications, 
                in commerce, the need to combat global menaces-- disease, pollution, 
                drought, famine-- through more effective and broader cooperation 
                amongst peoples must be compensated by cultural affinities conceived 
                on the scale of the human being.</p>
              <p class="body1">Until now the sovereign state acted as the responsible 
                monolith for both functions; now they must each be represented 
                on the European stage by </p>
              <p class="body1">1) the European Parliament,<br>
                2) the Assembly of Cultures.</p>
              <p class="body1">To this end I am engaged in establishing a representation 
                of cultures at the level of a greater Europe. The representatives, 
                either designated or chosen, would have to enjoy the confidence 
                and trust of their group, but they would also have to speak with 
                the aim of reaching agreement..</p>
              <p class="body1">The discussions, conducted in the presence of a 
                member of the European Court of Justice, would result in resolutions 
                or in further discussions, in arbitration or legislation. The 
                discussion concluded, the individual would return to home and 
                habitual work.</p>
              <p class="body1">The mission, if successfully accomplished, would 
                entitle the spokesman or woman to become a member of the full 
                meetings of the Assembly of Cultures. Full meetings of the Assembly 
                would be held once or twice a year in Brussels or Strasbourg. 
                The Cultures would also remain in constant touch with each other. 
                This would lead to a renunciation on the part of any given culture, 
                of sovereign national and territorial ambitions. Gradually national 
                police and military requirements would take on a European character, 
                as great world powers would no longer be required to defend a 
                self-reliant Europe.</p>
              <p class="body1">My foundation in Brussels is already furthering 
                this project with an office and a qualified gentleman in charge.</p>
              <p class="body1">Europe would thus have another chamber of representatives: 
                the one elected by the citizens-- the European Parliament-- and 
                the other as a counterweight -- a forum of the different cultures.</p>
              <p class="body1">Both houses would fully consider each other's attitudes 
                and propositions.</p>
              <p class="body1">As I see it, Mr. Prime Minister, this is the next 
                stage in the constant evolution and development of our democracies.</p>
              <p class="body1">I am convinced that an Assembly of Cultures can 
                play a decisive role in the emergence of a genuine European conscience, 
                which would constitute the best defense of its peoples and of 
                the community. The inclusion of cultures in Eastern Europe would 
                release a process of acclimatization whereby good neighborliness 
                and trust would permeate our Assembly of Cultures of greater Europe, 
                preparing them gradually for fuller membership in the Community, 
                a membership for which they are not qualified as yet, either economically 
                or, even more importantly, psychologically.</p>
              <p class="body1">We cannot include in the evolved community of western 
                Europe wherein territorial ambitions have been outgrown, those 
                other peoples whose mentality still reverts to territorial control 
                and expansion. They are still psychologically unevolved and unprepared 
                for European Union.</p>
              <p class="body1">This evolution could be immediately begun with 
                cultural contacts and expressions in every field, including the 
                political, of which evolution neither the political Parliament 
                of States, which are never completely free of mistrust, nor the 
                economic dictates of profitability in a free market are capable. 
                (See my letter to the Governor of Moscow.)</p>
              <p class="body1">Up until now our European Union has not shouldered 
                its role of Guardian of cultures which would protect a human being, 
                his heritage, his rights, his creativity.</p>
              <p class="body1">Europe will not survive on its past record alone, 
                however great are its contributions to democracy, to the arts, 
                the sciences and the social sciences; only when it will finally 
                give a shining example of a balanced, rich, diverse, multicolored 
                and harmonious society may other powers wish to emulate it rather 
                than destroy it.</p>
              <p class="body1">Also, whilst keeping our powder dry, our hands 
                and our minds and doors must be open, generous and sharing.</p>
              <p class="body1">For these reasons, Mr. Prime Minister, I would 
                ask you with a full heart to support the principle of the creation 
                of this representation of Cultures, and I would be very happy 
                if among the many issues you will discuss you could agree upon 
                two points:</p>
              <p class="body1">1)that the European Union should be called 'The 
                European Union of States and Cultures'</p>
              <p class="body1">and</p>
              <p class="body1">2)that the European Union declares itself the 'Guardian 
                of European Cultures.'</p>
              <p class="body1">In setting your sight high, even upon the unattainable, 
                you will attract the vast majority of people to your side, for 
                you will have given them to understand that vision and that a 
                future do exist; that clear and inspiring, noble purposes can 
                still be pursued -- and not only garages to repair outworn, outdated 
                mechanisms, reflexes and obsessional thoughts, narrow, timid, 
                and vulgar.</p>
              <p class="body1">As Prime Minister you are spokesman for and to 
                all your people -- rich, poor, old, young, of all colors and denominations 
                -- and of all political parties, for, of course, as soon as you 
                confine yourself to one political party or to an alliance you 
                will be opposed by others, several of which may have valid attitudes 
                and arguments.</p>
              <p class="body1">Will you allow me to say that neither the purposes, 
                nor the measures, nor the problems, nor all that which may link 
                these problems together, are presented with clarity and against 
                their backgrounds of weights and forces, which it would be essential 
                to do if you really want to convince a people, critical, experienced, 
                tested and tried, a people of essentially good character, yet 
                wary and cynical.</p>
              <p class="body1">The measures which you feel obliged to take consist 
                in part of responses to financial and economic problems, which 
                relate to social and civil ones, which in their turn are connected 
                to Europe, to foreign affairs, but very specially to the quality 
                of education, to health, physical and intellectual, to a creative, 
                moral code based on a consensus of values, heritage and traditions, 
                which are at the very heart of a civilization, however complex 
                it may be.</p>
              <p class="body1">Your own poor, suffering, aged, young, sick, the 
                sad unemployed, all the frustrated, the malcontents, the drugged, 
                the ill-informed and violent, this living tinder cannot be ignored-- 
                a multitude rarely considered by political parties, except gingerly 
                at election time.</p>
              <p class="body1">Solemn personal promises will not suffice. </p>
              <p class="body1">May I suggest that the very words are : to work 
                towards a civilization founded on a positive reciprocity, on the 
                balance of right with responsibility, and on duties and obligations 
                incumbent on all.</p>
              <p class="body1">As a rule I would say that rights belong to those 
                at the mercy of others and who lack an official voice.</p>
              <p class="body1">Thus, for instance, children (who, within their 
                capacity, safety and well-being should also exercise responsibility) 
                or the sick, or trees, would have rights in respect of their helplessness, 
                while, on the other hand, others by virtue of authority, knowledge, 
                skill, experience and influence should carry the responsibilities; 
                thus, the passenger has rights, where the chauffeur has specific 
                responsibilities; the patient has the right, the surgeon the responsibility.</p>
              <p class="body1">Our task is to build a civilization of positive 
                reciprocity. An education for reciprocity would concern itself 
                with the teaching from earliest infancy of the voice, by song 
                and speech, with everything which is absorbed and learned by example 
                and imitation-- dance, mime, a body language, a use of hands, 
                mind, heart and fantasy, in crafts, arts, in thoughts and speech, 
                in poetry, in compassion, in wonder. In this way the abstract 
                studies, beginning with reading and writing, can more easily sprout 
                on a humanely fertilized soil or soul.</p>
              <p class="body1">As you know, this is exactly the description of 
                what I pursue through the works of my Foundation (The International 
                Yehudi Menuhin Foundation) (the project is called MUS-E) in the 
                more difficult schools (violent and prejudiced) in Europe. We 
                now have a formal working arrangement with the Ministers of Culture 
                and Education in Spain and Portugal. This improved society based 
                on reciprocity, on the mutuality of services, on the recognition 
                of our interdependence and upon our desire to learn, would tend 
                largely to reduce our exaggerated dependencies on money itself.</p>
              <p class="body1">I would maintain that everyone, including the unemployed, 
                have the right to a lifelong education, to music and opera, to 
                theater and to sports, as well as to the basics of life-- even 
                holidays (a &quot;change of air&quot;) -- provided in part by 
                special electronic credit cards, by mutual services and the venues, 
                facilities, theaters and schools, provided by the state, by private 
                funds, and maintained by the people with free time. The financial 
                field of action could thereby be substantially reduced. People 
                would have the obligation to live without hurting their neighbor, 
                whilst enjoying a reciprocal liberty and serving, as they can 
                and may be inclined to, the needs of others. On such a basis a 
                healthy capitalism could flourish, never exceeding the limits 
                imposed by pollution, by the abuse of nature, of our mother earth, 
                of our resources, never breaking all bounds in the sale of arms, 
                drugs, children, nor in poisons of all sorts which apparently 
                share our economies.</p>
              <p class="body1">I would propose that salaries be related not only 
                to the employer's resources but also to a given, regional, national 
                (a European) income. Thus salaries would adjust to the given well-being 
                of a country.</p>
              <p class="body1">We must rethink basic rights and responsibilities. 
                These are all to life, ours and all other lives and all life upon 
                which we depend, and not to money alone.</p>
              <p class="body1">Forgive me if I allow myself to seize one of those 
                rare moments of historical opportunity to urge you to engage upon 
                a renewal of options and at the same time a return to certain 
                codes pronounced some two thousand and more years ago.</p>
              <p class="body1">Respectfully,</p>
