        "articleBody": "Some VERY interesting information on 666\n\n   by Ragnar Redbeard\n\n                                                         \n\n   From: \"Ragnar Redbeard\"\n\n   It has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response\n   to my question regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its\n   roots in numerology. This is the school of thought that agree with.\n   The number 666 has its origins in ancient numerology / astrology, and\n   is connected to what are called \"magic squares\". The ancients devised\n   a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered in such a way that\n   by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total each\n   time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made\n   up of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36\n   is of course, 666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of\n   666 which are attached to the 12 signs of the Zodiac.\n\n   666 = Pisces\n   333 = Aquarius\n   222 = Capricorn\n   111 = Sagitaurus\n   74 = Scorpio\n   37 = Libra\n   18 = Virgo\n   9 = Leo\n   6 = Cancer\n   3 = Gemini\n   2 = Taurus\n   1 = Aries\n\n   Here is what the Sun Square looks like:\n\n   6 32 3 34 35 1\n   7 11 27 28 8 30\n   19 14 16 15 23 24\n   18 20 22 21 17 13\n   25 29 10 9 26 12\n   36 5 33 4 2 31\n\n   The factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and\n   1. They are attached to the Zodiac signs as follows:\n\n   So, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each\n   of the 6 columns also has a total of 111.\n\n   The Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total\n   74 ( 9 X 74 = 666 ) One example is \"6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74\"\n\n   For those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74\n   were considered 'holy' numbers, associated with the Sun, which they\n   revered. Numerology / Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica)\n   also became a recurring phenomenon in the bible, particularely the\n   KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to Hermetica are found to be\n   recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious.\n\n  The famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists\n   in 1 Kings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from\n   neighboring kingdoms. Solomon is one of the more important examples of\n   this biblically coded wisdom.\n\n   Solomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during\n   his reign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and\n   the 12 tribes of Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue\n   found in 1 Kings is one hint - another is the name Solomon. \"Sol\" is\n   the Latin word for the Sun, \"Om\" is the Hindi word for the Sun, and\n   \"On\" is the Egyptian word for the Sun.\n\n   While 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology\n   found in the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First\n   a quick point regarding history:\n\n   In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to\n   be the official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the\n   topic of another discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For\n   the next 1500 years, all other religions or philosophies were\n   ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, to the point of knowledge of\n   many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, realizing that\n   practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to the\n   torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid\n   their knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were\n   practically the only ones with any sort of education, and thus were\n   trusted to read, write, and interpret for Rome. Fast forward to\n   somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that the bible should\n   be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars including\n   Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew &\n   Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds\n   that sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV\n   in such a way that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All\n   one has to do is decipher it.\n\n   Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it\n   is arranged the way it is. If someone was to write a code without\n   leaving any sort of decoding manual, it stands to reason that the\n   means of decoding his work would have to be included in his work. The\n   first step to deciphering this code would be to look for extremes.\n   Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center of the bible\n   (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. As\n   such, it almost jumps out and screams \"Hey, look at me!\" Psalms 117\n   has exactly 33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life\n   of Christ, and 33 generations from Adam to David.\n\n   *There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the\n   works attributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of\n   this theory. Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible.\n   You will find that it is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter\n   and find that the 46th word is \"Shake\". Count 46 words backwards from\n   the end of that chapter and find that the 46th word is \"spear\". The\n   mathematical laws of probability eliminate the \"coincidence\" theory,\n   and we conclude that with this method of \"counting the bible\" rather\n   than reading the bible we are on the right track.\n\n   Due to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other\n   than Church approved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate\n   knowledge of pre-Christian religious practices (particularely those\n   related to Numerology) is scarce. Some rudimentary information still\n   remains, such as the names and fables associated with the Pagan lore,\n   along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts. Many are\n   familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the\n   whole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that\n   exists in today's New Age circles consists mainly of simple\n   clairvoyance and \"love spells\". Many New Age occultists use the\n   principles of Gematria and such to discover \"their\" number, and so on.\n\n   Ancient 'magicians' used 7 unique number squares as the basis for\n   their wisdom. Each square was arranged in such a way that the total of\n   any column or row was the same. Each of the seven 'magic' squares was\n   also assigned a planetary value. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn,\n   Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated with a specific\n   square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible coding.\n   The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every\n   number from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the\n   six rows adds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is\n   from the Magic Square of the Sun that the infamous number 666\n   originates. 6 columns X 111 = 666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the\n   numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are a total of 3 squares and 6\n   rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds to 74, and are\n   listed below. 9 rectangles & squares X 74 = 666.\n\n   6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74\n\n   11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74\n\n   16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74\n\n   7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74\n\n   19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74\n\n  32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74\n\n   3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74\n\n   14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74\n\n   27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74\n\n   The numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will\n   turn up elsewhere later.\n\n   Very possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be\n   found in the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The\n   number 666 has 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with\n   the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or\n   12 signs of the Zodiac) serve to form a theme which was to become\n   common in many later religions. Odin had 12 chief priests, Solomon had\n   12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. The 1 + 12 phenomenon\n   is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there is a Judge, and\n   twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and twelve\n   Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious\n   analogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the\n   Sun Square, and the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac.\n\n   It should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore\n   sharing the 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling.\n   Furthermore, since the 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western\n   religions, it is likely that they originate from one source. This\n   source has been given many names throughout the centuries and usually\n   takes the form of secret societies. At one point it was discovered\n   that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was long\n   known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people\n   realized that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound\n   arrangements had a soothing effect, while some had an angering effect,\n   or a saddening effect. Ancient temples were often constructed in such\n   a way that the songs sung during services would have a maximum effect\n   on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render humans\n   unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to\n   conceal. Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the\n   detriment of society. When languages were constructed, their vowels\n   and consonants were assigned numerical values. The study of this\n   alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria, and Gematria is\n   used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.).\n\n   Deities, or important figures in mythology and religion are\n   constructed in accordance with the principles outlined above. English\n   Gematria assigns the value of \"1\" to the letter \"A\", and \"2\" to the\n   letter \"B\", etc. With this in mind, look at the word \"Jesus\":\n\n   J E S U S\n\n   10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74\n\n   Let it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to \"888\" in\n   Greek Gematria. Greek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8\n   characters, and the 24th characther has a value of 800. Jesus is\n   referred to as being the offspring of David throughout the bible, and\n   that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of Jesus\n   can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the\n   Mars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single\n   digits, we observe the following phenomenon:\n\n   2 6 7 2 3\n\n   4 3 7 8 7\n\n   8 5 4 3 9\n\n   1 9 1 5 4\n\n   5 6 1 2 6\n\n   After drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the\n   points on the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that\n   each triangle has a value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at\n   the number '7' in the first row, and its two base points sit at 4 and\n   1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted triangle has its upper right\n   point at the 7 in the last column, and travels across the column to\n   arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1 at the tip.\n   Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the\n   number 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel\n   across the horizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This\n   is why Jesus is referred to as a branch of David.\n\n   Note that the word \"Joshua\" adds to \"74\" in the same way Jesus does,\n   and incidentally so does the word \"occult\".\n\n   Even though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named\n   \"Shakespeare\" wrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting\n   'coincidence' is found by employing the coding concepts used by\n   Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing of the KJV). If we count 666\n   chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we arrive at Psalm 46.\n   Excluding the mysterious word \"selah\" (which appears 74 times\n   throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the\n   chapter and find the 46th word to be \"shake\". The 46th word from the\n   end of the chapter is \"spear\". This is coincidental to the theory held\n   by some that Francis Bacon wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare\n\n   When constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a\n   'decoder's guide' a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to\n   show us the structure of the code. Tools such as longest, shortest,\n   and repetition serve to draw attention. In keeping with this theory,\n   we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible, Psalm 117, is also\n   placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words, which by no\n   coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number\n   of generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in\n   Freemasonry.\n\n   On counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we\n   find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters\n   backwards from Psalm 117, we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7.\n   The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings 7 detail the construction of\n   Solomon's Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings 6, and construction\n   ends in 1 Kings 7.\n\n   Due to the fact that the word \"temple\" is often associated with\n   perfected man, and wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within\n   the biblical concept of Solomon. The word \"Solomon\" serves a dual\n   purpose in the coding of the bible. The word \"Sol\" is Latin for \"sun\",\n   the word \"Om\" is Hindi for \"sun\" and the word \"On\" is Egyptian for\n   \"sun\". Also, the vowel \"o\" is symmetrically placed throughout the word\n   3 times. Note that \"o\" is the 15th letter in the alphabet:\n\n   O O O\n\n   15 15 15\n\n  1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666\n\n  Even when presented with information such as this, the Christians will\n   grow stronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology\n   is evil. Sometimes it will be suggested that perhaps this coding was\n   designed by the devil to discredit the 'truth' of Christianity.\n   Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and the Sun Square, and\n   makes references to the 'temple', all of which are concepts borrowed\n   from the ancient Occult.\n\n   Not unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number \"7\" in\n   religion and mythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation\n   is a reference to the 7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in\n   the bible:\n\n  Seven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6),\n   Seven lamps of fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are\n   all references to the 7 magic squares.\n\n   Sometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are\n   used, and in Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the\n   belief system held by Francis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the\n   King James Bible. Revelation 2:17 reads\n\n   \"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the\n   churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden\n   manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name\n   written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it\"\n\n   In this case, the passage points to a new name written in 'a white\n   stone'. If one were to unscramble the words 'a white stone' we will\n   get 'thee is wotan'. Remember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known\n   as Asatru, and sometimes goes by the name 'Woden' or 'Odin'. The odds\n   on that being a coincidence simply cannot be fathomed.\n\n   Other than the passages to be unscrambled (\"a white stone\" - \"thee is\n   wotan\") and the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the\n   words in the bible are 'filler', which serve no real interpretive\n   purpose. The bible is so full of contradictions and pure nonsense that\n   it only stands to reason that it was not meant to be read, but\n   counted. Other theories suggest that the King James bible was written\n   as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest that\n   Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the\n   KJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom.\n   Both theories fit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that\n   the whole story will ever be known.\n\n   Now that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will\n   begin to fall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the\n   wisdom encoded into the KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a\n   few, and persecuted by religious tyrants for hundreds of years. This\n   essay outlined a few pointers and coding principles and the reader is\n   encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the bible, don't read it!\n\n   RR\n     _________________________________________________________________"

KDE has lots of room for improvement. we do a lot of\n   things quite well right now, however. and we'll get more things\n   Right(tm) with future development. but it's being able to hold both\n   the idea that we Rock and the idea that we have room for improvement\n   in our heads at the same time that's important.\n   anyways, on to Malte's numbers! he notes that `xterm -e bash -c exit`\n   takes 0.363s while 'konsole -e bash -c exit' takes 2.148s. holy crap!\n   over 6 times as long! ah... but there's a catch. a small one, but\n   still a catch...\n   on my system, with both xterm and konsole in cache so as to remove the\n   affects of disk i/o as much as possible, `xterm -e bash -c exit` takes\n   ~0.165s and 'konsole -e bash -c exit' takes ~.9s, but 'kstart konsole\n   -e bash -c exit' takes ~0.5s. the kstart hack brings konsole start up\n   times down from being ~5.5x slower to being ~3x slower. that's much\n   better, but more importantly, that multiplier works out to just one\n   third of a second longer to launch konsole.\n   now stop for a moment and consider that: a third of a second. for all\n   those features, for all that KDE goodness. 300 milliseconds.\n   let's also consider that terminals are really a Worst Case Scenario.\n   xterm and friends don't do a lot, and they aren't very interesting.\n   because of this they start up fast and are slim like that Olsen twin.\n   and still KDE apps compete reasonably in this space.\n   this bodes very well for KDE applications in more complex venues such\n   as word processors, web browsers and so on.\n   yes, we have a LOT of optimization possibilities ahead of us. yes, our\n   software can and should be faster, including starting up. yes, we have\n   a lot of development ahead of us to do because KDE isn't perfect yet.\n   we're only mostly perfect. ;-)\n\n   posted by Aaron J. Seigo at 1:02 PM   \n\n15 Comments:\n\n      that pic you linked says 'Forbidden' ;(\n      Before I prelinked everything, KWrite took something like 3\n       seconds to start (after, it's more like one). Compare to Notepad\n       under Windows, which starts *instantly*. A more\n       comparable/advanced editor called EditPad Pro still starts up in\n       ~half a second. MS Word 97 also starts up damn fast, well under a\n       second, iirc (though I haven't tried in a while). The situation is\n       similar with other KDE apps (or Linux apps in general? no idea,\n       haven't tried GNOME).\n       Not bashing or anything; KDE rocks. But the first step to fixing a\n       problem is recognizing that it exists. And this one most\n       definitely does.\n       -Illissius\n       By Anonymous, at 1:53 PM  \n     I don't clock much difference between using kstart\n       or not; 1.9s without, 1.27 with. Xterm on the other hand is 0.5s.\n       But I've just noticed that using KDE on the same machine but with\n       Debian feels faster than using KDE with SuSE, and these are the\n       SuSE numbers.\n       By Anonymous, at 2:08 PM  \n    @Illissius\n       please re-read the blog entry. i think you missed three important\n       things:\n       i note that KDE can and should be made faster, including start\n       up. so i'm not sure what you're going on about.\n       this is about konsole on X11/Unix, not kwrite and not notepad\n       on win32. i know the similarity between konsole and kwrite or\n       xterm and notepad can lead to confusion (he says, firmly tongue in\n       cheek) but today's blog was about konsole. on X11. on Unix type\n       platforms.\n       moreover, the whole point of the blog was to show that Malte's\n       numbers weren't as good as they could be. you demonstrate that\n       yourself with KWrite dropping from ~3s to ~1s with prelink, which\n       means instead of being 6 times slower to start than your win32 app\n       it's only 2 times slower to start. and that doubling in time\n       equates to half a second!\n       in summary: i completely agree that we can and should do better in\n       the start up category. but we don't nearly deserve the rap we have\n       at the moment.\n       you'd think we were molasses on a winter day given how people yam\n       on about it. the way it's commonly talked about, you'd think KDE\n       apps take dozens of seconds or even minutes to start up! that KDE\n       requires half a gig of RAM! etc, etc...\n       all i'm looking for is some accurate and factual representations\n       out there, because KDE and the Linux desktop in general is getting\n       hurt by the mythconceptions that continue to float about.\n       By Aaron J. Seigo, at 2:35 PM  \n     @Anonymous:\n       1.9 - 1.27 = 0.63\n       0.63 / 1.9 = 0.33\n       33% is significant from an optimization standpoint.\n       it also drops the \"Xterm differential\" from ~4x to ~2.5x. and it\n       means an extra 0.77s of wait.\n       yep, still too long (because it isn't perfect ;) but not the\n       drudgery that so many claim it to be.\n       By Aaron J. Seigo, at 2:39 PM  \n     @aseigo: I was essentially agreeing with you. Startup times aren't\n       only relevent for Konsole, which is why I generalized it, and\n       KWrite was the first example I could think of. 3 seconds (with the\n       default setup) isn't completely horrible, but it can be painful\n       when you just want to quickly edit some text, especially compared\n       to something like Notepad which starts instantly.\n       As for prelinking... is it a viable option to do this by default?\n       From what I remember there was something about the prelink going\n       away if either the binary or the library linked to is changed,\n       meaning startup times would gradually deteriorate over time...\n       which isn't good. Or is there a better way to achieve the same\n       effect?\n       Anyways, as I said, I'm agreeing with you completely; just adding\n       my own observations.\n       -Illissius\n       By Anonymous, at 3:11 PM  \n     Hi Aaron,\n       to konsole: konsole has become quite bloated. It links to the huge\n       kio lib just to have bookmarks. I never used these bookmarks. Does\n       anybody else ?\n       I measured startup time, it must be already 3 years ago on my old\n       K6/200. Originally it was 2.7 seconds. After one week of work I\n       got it down to 1.8 seconds. This was achieved by delaying\n       everything what could be delayed (which resulted in not so easy to\n       understand code).\n       At least two times since then this delayed construction of stuff\n       was broken and I fixed it again. I didn't look at it since some\n       time now, so I don't know if it currently works. As I mentioned,\n       it was 1.8 seconds on a K6/200, KDE 2.x.\n       I already thought about writing a slim konsole, with less features\n       (or basically without kio)\n       Bye\n       Alex\n       neundorf at kde dot org\n       By Anonymous, at 3:13 PM  \n     @Illissius\n       to prelink or not to prelink is something that's up to the\n       individual OS vendors/projects. AFAIK, a lot of the benefits from\n       the early prelink hack has been moved into the newer glibc's and\n       ld's so these benefits should trickle on out to the world en masse\n       with time.\n       @Alex\n       yeah, i remember your work on konsole start up times and vastly\n       appreciated it when it happened (and then happened again ;). i'm\n       not sure if it's been broken since, i surely hope not.\n       as for the bookmarks and linking in libkio for that, i agree that\n       it was a questionable feature add. of course, if we remove it now\n       some small army of users will rise up in arms. ;-) i'll have to\n       blog someday about the dangers of adding features just to add\n       features. not like that hasn't be blog'd to death, but hey.... ;-)\n       By Aaron J. Seigo, at 3:20 PM  \n      Aaron, first, thanks for the coolness factor -- I hope you don't\n       mind that I uppercased your first I :)\n       I never intended my \"benchmark\" to be represantative, it was just\n       something I, ummm..., hacked into a one shot Konsole I opened for\n       that reason :P And actually, Kwrite, which Illissius mentioned, is\n       another candidate which I use in that way.\n       Whatever the kstart kluge you mentioned gave me a 33% speedup,\n       too. What's the difference with that?\n       If it doesn't hve too much drawbacks, maybe instead of me having\n       to prefix all the commands in KDE's .desktop files, something like\n       that should become the default? Or at least an option in KDE\n       .desktop files to start apps like that? (Please don't ask me for\n       code :)\n       Cheers,\n       Malte\n       By Anonymous, at 4:44 PM  \n      I just tried, kstart doesn't change anything for me here.\n       You can try kdeinit_wrapper konsole , this starts konsole vioa\n       kdeinit (you probably already guessed). Now this is something\n       nobody will type all the time. OTOH who starts konsole by typing\n       konsole into a terminal ? AFAIK minicli also uses kdeinit to start\n       kde apps.\n       (maybe a bunch of aliases like\n       alias Konsole = kdeinit_wrapper konsole\n       wouldn't be too bad)\n       Alex\n       Alex\n       By Anonymous, at 5:18 PM  \n      Don't we have a better place to discuss optimizations? Like, a\n       certain mailing list? Anyway...\n       The kstart vs no-kstart \"benchmark\" is flawed. Adding kstart to\n       \"time konsole -e bash -c exit\" changes only two things:\n        makes the startup longer\n        makes 'time' measure the startup time of kstart (only) - I can\n       even see the output from 'time' here before konsole shows up\n       For Alex, about kdeinit_wrapper:\n       You can do 'ln -s /opt/kde3/bin/kdeinit_wrapper konsole'\n       somewhere, and if you have that first in your $PATH, just doing\n       'konsole' will launch konsole using kdeinit (the same works with\n       kshell and kwrapper - see kdelibs/kinit/README.wrapper).\n       Lubos Lunak\n       By Anonymous, at 2:27 AM  \n      isnt it strange if kstart and/or kde-init can make apps startup\n       faster, they aren't normally used? is there some dis-advantage at\n       stake, or should the distributions do it, or???\n       By Anonymous, at 6:59 AM  \n      This post has been removed by a blog administrator.\n       By Anonymous, at 12:22 PM  \n      This blog is awesome!

(As a matter of fact, we recently featured an\n   incredibly useful government resource, FirstGov, in Yahoo! Picks of\n   the Week.) To find the answer to your question, we searched on the\n   term \"U.S. Marshal\" and quickly found the answer at the U.S.\n   Department of Justice web site.\n\n   The United States Marshals Service section provided all the\n   information we needed. The first thing we spotted was the U.S.\n   Marshals Service mission statement:\n\n     The mission of the United States Marshals Service is to protect\n     theFederal courts and ensure the effective operation of the\n     judicial system.\n\n   That statement provided a good start, but we wanted to know more about\n   a U.S. Marshal's day-to-day activities. Fortunately, all we had to do\n   was continue reading.\n\n   The role of the U.S. Marshal is constantly changing depending on the\n   state of the union. In the past, they were responsible for such duties\n   as taking the census and protecting the president. In recent years,\n   the U.S. Marshals have been responsible for \"providing protection for\n   the federal judiciary, transporting federal prisoners, protecting\n   endangered federal witnesses and managing assets seized from criminal\n   enterprises.\" We also learned that U.S. Marshals arrest more federal\n   fugitives than all other federal agencies combined, makingaround 55\n   percent of all federal arrests.\n\n   In the wake of the recent attacks in New York and Washington, D.C.,\n   there has been a great deal of discussion about the implementation of\n   a Federal Air Marshal program. We weren't sure whether the two\n   programs were related, so we searched on the term \"air marshal\" and\n   discovered that they are indeed different governmental programs.\n\n   The Federal Air Marshal program provides \"an anti-hijacking capability\n   for U.S. civil aviation\" and is part of the Federal Aviation\n   Administration.

Draft resolution\n\n   1.       Strong, steady growth can be noted in human mobility. Europe,\n   which is viewed as an area of stability and prosperity, will continue\n   in coming years to be immensely attractive to migrants from\n   less-favoured countries and to asylum seekers fleeing wars,\n   persecution and human rights violations.\n\n   2.       In a multicultural, multi-ethnic Europe, which is\n   increasingly a refuge for asylum seekers and a destination for\n   immigrants, the most pressing challenge for governments is to\n   guarantee that the fundamental values of our societies, such as the\n   respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, will be shared\n   by everyone living in Europe.\n\n   3.       It is necessary to take up this challenge in order to be able\n   to benefit fully from the opportunities that immigration offers Europe\n   in terms of the supply of labour, intellectual input and cultural\n   diversity.\n\n   4.       The concept of integration aims at ensuring social cohesion\n   through accommodation of diversity understood as a two-way process. On\n   the one hand, immigrants have to accept basic values of European\n   societies. On the other, host societies have to respect immigrants'\n   dignity and distinct identity and to take it into account when\n   elaborating domestic policies.\n\n   5.       In accordance with its previous recommendations and\n   resolutions, the Parliamentary Assembly reiterates the importance of\n   implementing effective policies to ensure full integration of\n   foreigners residing lawfully in Council of Europe member states as\n   part of an overall strategy covering all aspects of migration,\n   including labour migration and illegal migration, and the efforts to\n   combat trafficking in human beings and to combat terrorism.\n\n   6.       In this connection, the Assembly refers to its Recommendation\n   1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of immigrants in Council\n   of Europe member states and in particular reasserts the principle that\n   immigrants should be able to participate fully in the life of the host\n   country, on the basis of equality of rights and opportunities in\n   return for equality of obligations. Those obligations include showing\n   respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the\n   European Convention on Human Rights, for the principle of equality\n   between women and men and, generally, for the Constitution and laws of\n   the host state.\n\n   7.       Council of Europe member states must, for their part, ensure\n   that, within their jurisdiction, immigrants are not discriminated\n   against in terms of access to and protection of their rights, with a\n   particular attention to certain sectors, such as education and\n   employment.\n\n   8.       The Assembly draws attention to the many activities pursued\n   by the Council of Europe's intergovernmental committees, in particular\n   the European Committee on Migration (CDMG), to devise and promote\n   integration policies capable of meeting the current challenges.\n\n   9.       In this connection, the Assembly calls on Council of Europe\n   member states to:\n\n   i.       make it one of their political priorities to agree a\n   migration strategy, entailing an overall approach encompassing all\n   aspects of migration, including its causes and consequences and the\n   challenges it raises. In this context, it would be appropriate to:\n   a.       emphasise the importance of co-development policies, with the\n       aim of reducing poverty in the countries of origin, while giving\n       them responsibility for managing development instruments and\n       resources;\n       b.       take steps to avoid migratory movements generated by the\n       need for protection, through activities and means of pressure\n       aimed at preventing conflicts and promoting respect for human\n       rights in the countries of origin;\n\n   ii.       ensure, in all their activities that may have implications\n   for migration, including fighting terrorism, strict respect for human\n   rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the European\n   Convention on Human Rights and the protocols thereto;\n\n   iii.       offer opportunities for lawful immigration, with a view to\n   employment, to a number of would-be emigrants on the basis of a\n   selection founded on objective criteria which take account of labour\n   market needs in the host country and its social system's capacity to\n   guarantee a reasonable standard of living for these workers and their\n   families;\n\n   iv.       make a subsequent effort to foster knowledge of the\n   fundamental values of the Council of Europe at all levels within\n   society, in particular among immigrants, by:\n   a.       holding courses on basic rights and responsibilities for\n       newly arrived immigrants, free of charge;\n       b.       including this type of instruction in optional or\n       mandatory integration schemes for immigrants in those countries\n       where such schemes exist;\n       c.       where possible, organising this type of instruction in\n       the countries of origin for would-be emigrants whose applications\n       have been accepted;\n\n   v.       promote campaigns for the distribution of reliable, clear\n   information, not liable to be interpreted in a racist or xenophobic\n   manner, on migration and on the culture, traditions and integration\n   objectives of immigrants living within their borders;\n\n   vi.       develop reliable instruments for measuring migratory\n   movements at national level and co-operate in ensuring data\n   comparability at an international level.\n\n   10.       In addition, the Assembly invites the European Union to:\n\n   i.       pursue its efforts to establish a common asylum and migration\n   policy;\n\n   ii.       support the new member states' efforts to cope with illegal\n   immigration and to endow them with legal and practical means of\n   enhancing immigrants' integration;\n\n   iii.       help raise European public awareness of the consequences of\n   the accession of the new member states and of their citizens' rights\n   with regard to freedom of movement.\n\n   II.       Explanatory memorandum by Mr Jean-Guy Branger\n\n   \"Immigrants are a living testimony to history and to the present.\"\n   Emile Mallet, Sociologist\n\n   I.        Introduction\n\n   1.       The issues raised by immigration and integration represent a\n   huge challenge that Europe must now take up. This is because human\n   mobility is showing strong, steady growth. Europe, which is perceived\n   as a stable, prosperous area, will continue in coming years to be\n   extremely attractive to migrants from less fortunate countries. The\n   Council of Europe has to take full part in debate on the integration\n   process, as the challenge posed is consistent with fulfilment of its\n   principal objectives.\n\n   2.       The vast majority of people who have settled in Europe on a\n   long-term basis have gradually become integrated in the population of\n   the host country and aspire to live there peacefully, being aware of\n   the advantages Europe has to offer in terms of respect for fundamental\n   freedoms and human rights, employment and access to health care and,\n   in the case of their children, to education. Yet most of the Council\n   of Europe member states are now reconsidering the integration policies\n   they have pursued to date, which have not succeeded fully\n   satisfactorily in integrating immigrants lawfully resident on their\n   territory and members of their families into the economic, social and\n   political set-up of the country. This situation is reflected in the\n   compartmentalisation of society and fosters feelings of intolerance\n   and xenophobia.\n\n   3.       While western Europe has taken in tens of millions of\n   immigrants who came in search of freedom and the opportunity to\n   prosper, it is now the destination of waves of migrants from areas\n   where not only is there rampant poverty, but despotic governments or\n   terrorist groups act in an arbitrary fashion or are guilty of\n   persecution or violence. All that these prospective immigrants know\n   about European civilisation is that it is materially successful; they\n   are unaware of the rules underpinning our societies, which are based\n   on the principles of equality and the universality of human rights.\n   These migrants put our societies in a paradoxical situation, insofar\n   as people come to Europe in search of protection against arbitrary\n   rule and access to political, social and financial independence,\n   whereas certain groups would like to impose rules governing \"immigrant\n   communities\" that are at variance with the independence that goes\n   hand-in-hand with equality and the universality of human rights.\n\n   4.       It is all the more difficult to rise to the challenge as the\n   second-generation and third-generation children of immigrants\n   sometimes claim to adhere to \"fundamentalist\" groups, whereas their\n   parents wanted themselves and their children to become integrated into\n   the host society.\n\n   5.       This challenge is having to be addressed in a difficult\n   climate, in which there is a decline in the number of industrial jobs\n   in Europe as a result of relocation and, at the same time, an influx\n   of poorly-skilled immigrants who, precisely the because of their lack\n   of skills, have problems in finding jobs. It has to be admitted that\n   the difficulties experienced by certain immigrants are exploited,\n   under the pretext of the strict enforcement of certain religious laws,\n   for subversive political ends, which go so far as to include\n   enlistment by terrorist groups, as is borne out by the attacks in the\n   United States on 11 September 2001 and those in Madrid on\n   11 March 2004.\n\n   6.       It must likewise be admitted that certain iniquitous\n   religious leaders stir up feelings of hatred or even racism towards\n   the host society or some sections of that society. This is leading to\n   an unacceptable resurgence of the anti-Semitism that left its tragic\n   mark on Europe's history. Our countries must not turn a blind eye to\n   these challenges to their own values and must take a firm stand in\n   response to those who call for ever-greater tolerance and who at the\n   same time disseminate messages of hatred or even encourage terrorism.\n   This firm stand must, however, be taken with due regard for the rules\n   laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the\n   constitutional safeguards in force in European countries.\n\n   7.       The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has paid\n   particularly close attention to the question of integrating\n   immigrants, a field in which it has adopted, inter alia,\n   Recommendation 712 (1973) on integration of migrant workers with the\n   society of their host countries, Resolution 631 (1976) on integration\n   of migrants into society as regards education and cultural\n   development, Recommendation 1206 (1993) on integration of migrants and\n   community relations, Recommendation 1500 (2001) on participation of\n   immigrants and foreign residents in political life in the Council of\n   Europe member states and Recommendation 1596 (2003) on the situation\n   of young migrants in Europe. The Rapporteur also wishes to mention\n   Recommendation 1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of\n   immigrants in Council of Europe member states, and in particular the\n   principle that immigrants should be able to participate fully in the\n   life of the host country's society on the basis of equality of rights\n   and opportunities in return for equality of obligations.\n\n   2.       Fundamental values of the Council of Europe\n\n   8.       The fundamental values upheld by the Council of Europe are\n   human rights, pluralist democracy, the rule of law, which takes\n   precedence over force, and the promotion of the cultural diversity of\n   Europe. This diversity is not a culture in itself, but a mosaic of\n   different cultures.\n\n   9.       Since 11 September 2001 it has been necessary to supplement\n   these values with a political objective common to all member states:\n   that of combating terrorism, which, having struck in other parts of\n   the world before reaching our borders, made its full presence felt\n   within Europe itself, with the bloody attack in Madrid in March 2004\n   (a repeat of the attacks in Paris in 1986, among others). The constant\n   threat we face from terrorist groups is such that we cannot lower our\n   guard in the near or foreseeable future: it is a key factor that must\n   now be incorporated in our discussions on immigration and integration.\n\n   10.       Fundamentalism can lead to terrorism, and we must take this\n   into account in our own countries by ensuring that the groups\n   concerned do not have a podium within our national borders that they\n   can use to spread hate; at the same time, we must be careful that the,\n   albeit necessary, measures taken do not undermine the Council of\n   Europe's values by imposing unwarranted, disproportionate restrictions\n   on immigrants' personal freedoms or by discriminating against them.\n   Combating illegal immigration, and dismantling the human trafficking\n   networks which are, unfortunately, all too common on European\n   territory, are also priorities for the future. France, with the reform\n   of its legislation early in 2004 at the instigation of Mr Nicolas\n   Sarkozy, is one of the countries behind this approach.\n\n   3.       Demographic context\n\n      \t  3.1.       Statistics\n\n         3.1.1.       Population trends in the main regions of Europe\n   from 1950 to 2050\n\n   11.       Analyses for western Europe based on work by the United\n   Nations dating from 2001 reveal the following situation: after a very\n   steep population increase between 1950 and 1975, the pace of increase\n   declines until 2010; the population then tends to stagnate until 2013,\n   after which it begins to fall increasingly steeply until 2050.\n\n   12.       In southern Europe there is a substantial increase until the\n   1990s, which then slows down until 2010, after which the population\n   falls sharply, to return to the 1960 figure by 2050.\n\n   13.       In northern Europe, the population increase is moderate but\n   steady from the 1950s to the 2030s, and then declines very slightly\n   until 2050.\n\n   14.       In eastern Europe, excluding the Russian Federation, the\n   situation is somewhat comparable to that in southern Europe, with an\n   even more substantial rise in population until the 2000s, followed by\n   a much faster, sharper fall, bringing the population in 2050 back to\n   what it was in 1950.\n\n   15.       The situation in the Russian Federation is even more\n   dramatic: having shot up in the period up to the 1990s, the population\n   falls particularly quickly and spectacularly up to 2050.\n\n   16.       All these analysis are based on the likely hypothesis that\n   the fertility rate will rise slightly but will never be sufficient to\n   make good the difference between the number of births and the number\n   of deaths, as the latter is, on average, increasingly high.\n\n   17.       We can therefore expect a general decline in Europe's\n   population, which it will not be possible to offset by fertility\n   alone.\n\n         3.1.2.       Fertility\n\n   18.       The annual fertility rate in Europe is particularly low,\n   although there are many geographical disparities. Europe is having to\n   cope with an ageing population, and hence a shrinking work force,\n   matched by an increase in the retired population.\n\n   19.       In France, births exceed deaths by a figure of some 250,000.\n   Norway and the Netherlands also have significant excesses of births\n   over deaths. The United Kingdom has a slight excess, while in Sweden\n   there are equal numbers of births and deaths. In Italy, Spain,\n   Portugal, Greece and Poland, there has been a small variation,\n   resulting in the number of births being slightly lower than the number\n   of deaths. In Germany and central Europe there are already more deaths\n   than births: the situation is alarming in the Russian Federation.\n\n   20.       At the same time, the populations of the United States and\n   Canada are growing steadily.\n\n         3.1.3.       Migration\n\n   21.       The 20th century saw an increase in migration, one reason\n   being the growing number and increasing speed of means of\n   communication. Unfortunately, however, the main explanation is the\n   existence, firstly, of major world conflicts and, secondly, of\n   local/regional conflicts nearer home.\n\n   22.       Before the Second World War, Europe had more emigrants than\n   immigrants. The trend was gradually reversed and, little by little,\n   spread even to the southern European countries. The collapse of the\n   Soviet Union did not lead to as great a population movement towards\n   western Europe as had been feared in certain quarters, particularly in\n   view of the enlargement of the European Union. On the other hand, the\n   conflicts tearing central and west Africa apart, along with poverty\n   and population growth rates that always exceed economic growth,\n   however vigorous that may be, prompt thousands of men and women to try\n   to emigrate to Europe.\n\n   23.       It is worth taking a look at the percentage of immigrants in\n   a number of countries between 1980 and 2000. In Belgium it was fairly\n   stable, apart from a slight fall in the late 1980s, at 9% of the total\n   population. In Germany, apart from a decline between 1992 and 1994,\n   which was soon made good, it increased steadily, from 7.2 to about\n   8.3%. In Italy, which was for long time an emigration country, the\n   proportion remained very low, even though it rose rapidly, from 0.3 to\n   2.8%, largely because of the arrival of an ever-growing number of\n   illegal immigrants from Africa in Sicily and other Mediterranean\n   islands, such as Lampedusa, or from Albania and the Balkans. It is\n   particularly worth taking note of the situation in Switzerland, which\n   is completely different, in that Switzerland is the only Council of\n   Europe member state to have introduced and administered a genuine\n   immigration policy, quantified according to its needs: the proportion\n   of the population accounted for by immigrants rose from 14% in 1980 to\n   over 19% in 1996; this was followed by a steady but as yet moderate\n   fall to just over 18% of the total population.\n\n         3.2.       Excess of births over deaths and net migration\n\n   24.       Net migration, or the difference over a given period between\n   the number of emigrants and the number of immigrants, is a variable\n   that is difficult to assess in many countries, because the figures\n   used to establish it are often unreliable, particularly on account of\n   illegal immigration, which is inherently difficult to quantify. The\n   myth of \"Fortress Europe\" must be refuted, as is demonstrated by the\n   report by Mr Thierry Mariani, French member of parliament. In the year\n   2000, 1.7 million people lawfully entered the 15-member European Union\n   alone, while the number of new illegal immigrants is estimated at\n   500,000. The total figure of 2,200,000 people means that five times\n   the population of Luxembourg, or a population equivalent to that of\n   the city of Berlin, settled in Europe in one year. France took in some\n   200,000 new legal immigrants in 2002, while 150,000 people obtained\n   French nationality and were therefore no longer counted as foreigners.\n\n   25.       The actual figure is very often twice that indicated by the\n   official statistics. Even if we were to double the latter, however,\n   the result would not be sufficient to offset the general decline in\n   fertility.\n\n   26.       Can population trends be influenced? There is no certainty\n   that it will be possible to bring about a resurgence of the birth\n   rate, a very uncertain parameter, in all the member states. Moreover,\n   the effects of any such resurgence would not be apparent until much\n   later, since it is estimated that it takes 25 years for a demographic\n   change of this kind to make itself felt. As for the decline in\n   mortality and the increase in longevity, we can only welcome these\n   trends and hope that they continue and are matched by an improvement\n   in the quality of life in the extra years gained. Account has to be\n   taken of decline in mortality, which is accompanied by ageing of the\n   population, which places a heavy burden on national and European\n   budgets.\n\n   27.       This brings us to the European context of migration. Europe\n   has to prepare itself to continue to receive new arrivals. This\n   immigration may be desired and organised (selective immigration) or\n   uncontrolled. The immigrants will have to be integrated, and it must\n   be borne in mind that the previous generations were not always\n   integrated easily or satisfactorily.\n\n   28.       The experts all agree that immigration cannot be considered\n   a miracle solution that will offset the effects of the ageing of the\n   population and the falling birth rate, for immigrants themselves are\n   ageing, and their average age is only slightly lower than that of the\n   host population. There are those who contend that this means that\n   ever-increasing immigration is necessary. Massive immigration might be\n   more profitable in purely demographic terms and could attenuate the\n   impact of the ageing of the population, but the benefits have to be\n   set against the fact that the number of jobs, including those that are\n   most accessible, is shrinking because industries are relocating\n   outside Europe, and against the economic and social problems that\n   massive immigration may cause, given that the integration process is\n   inherently slow.\n\n   4.       Migration context\n\n         4.1.       Historical background\n\n   29.       It should first be noted that, although instruments for\n   measuring migration exist, the figures produced are often inaccurate,\n   either because of a lack of political will or because the resources\n   needed to use them are lacking. This is the case in the most highly\n   developed countries. The situation is even more complicated in\n   countries where facilities for monitoring migration are not yet\n   properly established, as in some of the new EU member states.\n\n   30.       Immigration takes very different forms, depending on the\n   country concerned, its geographical location and its history.\n\n   31.       After taking in immigrant labour, after the Second World\n   War, from its eastern and southern regions and then from North Africa\n   and the former colonies, Europe is now taking in migrants from\n   countries where there is great social deprivation, from war zones and\n   from areas ruled by despots.\n\n   32.       Germany, for instance, took in 12 million refugees of German\n   origin after 1945, and 3 million East Germans between 1949 in 1961.\n   Thereafter, the bulk of immigration came from Portugal, Greece and the\n   former Yugoslavia. This was followed by substantial Turkish\n   immigration, currently estimated at nearly 3 million people.\n\n   33.       The Netherlands took in 300,000 returning emigrants from\n   Indonesia, 200,000 from Surinam and 80,000 from the Dutch West Indies\n   as a result of decolonisation. This was followed by substantial\n   immigration from Morocco.\n\n   34.       Italy, having long been a source of emigration, gradually\n   became an immigration country, particularly after the dismantlement\n   of Soviet Union. A period of \"Muslim\" integration was followed by\n   non-Muslim integration from Romania and Ukraine. There are now some\n   2,300,000 immigrants with residence permits. This figure does not\n   cover minors, for whom there are no records. The very high number of\n   lawful immigrants is the result of the fact that numerous immigrants\n   have had their situation regularised. The latest round of\n   regularisation, which took place in 2003, saw between 600,000 and\n   700,000 illegal immigrants regularised. The figures reveal a\n   demographic change in the immigrant population: men have brought their\n   wives to Italy, thereby reuniting their families. Muslim women,\n   however, are not likely to work, in accordance with their cultural\n   traditions.\n\n   35.       Britain experienced large-scale immigration following\n   decolonisation, and in the 1990s became a preferred destination for\n   asylum-seekers. This was because conditions of admission to the\n   country were relatively attractive compared with some other European\n   states, in particular loose border controls, the fact that new\n   arrivals did not need to produce certain administrative documents and\n   the complete freedom of expression prevailing there. This situation\n   became a sticking point with France regarding illegal immigration.\n   Illegal immigrants wishing to enter Britain transited via France, in\n   the hope of slipping across the Channel, but were usually caught and\n   found themselves blocked in northern France, where they were housed in\n   increasingly overcrowded reception centres, including the regrettably\n   well-known Sangatte camp. Living conditions in Sangatte were very\n   poor, and inmates had no chance of remaining in France unless they\n   were granted asylum (but that meant satisfying the conditions). Yet\n   settling in Britain inspired such great hope that illegal immigrants\n   continued to be drawn in large numbers to northern France, at the risk\n   of being consigned to these squalid camps and subsequently expelled.\n   The situation was resolved only when Britain agreed to review the\n   status of these would-be immigrants and to change its asylum and\n   immigration conditions. The most recent statistics show a plunge in\n   applications for asylum in Britain in 2003, with 61,050 cases\n   registered compared with 103,100 in 2002.\n\n   36.       France's strong tradition of taking in immigrants and\n   asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of their obtaining full\n   citizenship. In 2002 France took in some 200,000 new arrivals, who\n   came to stay, while 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were\n   able to become naturalised and obtain all the rights available to\n   French citizens. In the case of France, the immigration figures must\n   be interpreted in the light of two specific legal features: jus soli,\n   whereby nationality is acquired by virtue of birth on French\n   territory, and the ease with which French nationality may be obtained.\n   Thus, although the figure for the population of foreign nationality\n   settled in France seems to have been stable for the last 50 years, at\n   about 10% of the population, or some 5 million people, account must be\n   taken of the 120,000 naturalisations that take place every year (the\n   equivalent of the population of a city such as Rouen or Dijon) and the\n   fact that French nationality is automatically granted to children born\n   in France of foreign parents. Demographers have been able to establish\n   that one French person in four has at least one grandparent of foreign\n   extraction. If France had legislation comparable to that of the states\n   that apply jus sanguinis, the figure for the proportion of immigrants\n   settled in France would doubtless have to be doubled. Indeed, an\n   earlier report presented to the Assembly stated that France accounted\n   for 75% of immigrants of North African origin settled in Europe.\n   Quite apart from this steady immigration from its former colonies in\n   North and West Africa, France is one of the main destinations of\n   asylum-seekers not only from Africa but also from the Balkans, Central\n   Asia and the Far East. France took in numerous asylum-seekers fleeing\n   Vietnam after the Communist victory, the \"boat people\", whose quiet\n   but outstanding success is a tribute to their courage and, at the same\n   time, shows that communities with different cultures can live together\n   harmoniously. There was then a rush of asylum-seekers from all the\n   zones where there was conflict and poverty, from the Congo to\n   Pakistan, not to mention the \"bogus\" asylum-seekers who migrate for\n   economic reasons.\n\n         4.2.       Recent state of migration\n\n   37.       Germany absorbs a massive number of non-EU immigrants, the\n   great majority from Turkey. France also attracts twice as many non-EU\n   as EU immigrants, unlike Luxembourg and Ireland. Germany is still\n   attracting more Turks, Poles and Italians. France takes in large\n   numbers of Algerians and Moroccans. Finland is gradually becoming an\n   immigration country. There is also considerably intra-EU movement\n   between France, Germany and the United Kingdom.\n\n   38.       As Europe enlarges, its borders are pushed further back, and\n   what was previously extra-Community immigration is now becoming an\n   intra-EU migration flow; at the same time, countries from Poland to\n   Cyprus now lie along the borders of eastern and southern Europe will\n   henceforth be facing a new type of immigration from eastern Europe,\n   Asia Minor, and even the Far East and Africa.\n\n         4.3.       Causes of migration\n\n   39.       Having taken in tens of millions of immigrants arriving in\n   Europe in search of freedom and possible access to prosperity, the Old\n   Continent is now the destination of migrants from areas afflicted not\n   only by economic deprivation but also by arbitrary government or\n   indeed persecution and violence by dictatorships and/or terrorist\n   groups. The only thing such prospective emigrants know about European\n   civilisation is its apparent material success: they know nothing of\n   the rules governing the functioning of our societies, drawing on the\n   principle of equality and universal individual rights. Even more\n   seriously, many of them have no desire to share such principles, which\n   some go about defying or even combating.\n\n   40.       The causes of migration may be broken down into three main\n   trends:\n\n   i.       demographic factors: differential population growth; high\n   fertility rates, combined with high mortality rates, often compounded\n   with one of the factors mentioned below, result in a migration flow\n   which is vital for survival (the case of much of Asia, for instance,\n   and Africa, with average birth rates of 7 surviving children per\n   family, as in Nigeria);\n\n   ii.       economic factors: underdevelopment, which happens when\n   population growth exceeds economic growth, even where the latter is\n   robust: this applies to immigration from the third world, with\n   immigrants aspiring to a degree of prosperity inaccessible to them in\n   their countries of origin;\n\n   iii.       political factors: war, insecurity, oppression and ethnic\n   and religious persecution.\n\n   41.       More and more emergency situations are due to famines,\n   epidemics, tribal conflicts or terrorism. The most tragic problem,\n   tragic because it should actually be the easiest to solve, is that of\n   famines, given that they are often combined with other factors. The\n   situation is exacerbated by the corruption of elites or warlords, who\n   block the distribution of food aid, which is nevertheless widely\n   available, or prevent it from reaching the actual famine victims.\n\n         4.4.       The economic and social consequences of migration in\n   host societies\n\n   42.       The European context is difficult in that not only is\n   industrial employment in decline, particularly owing to relocations,\n   but also there is a huge influx of immigrants who have difficulty\n   entering the labour market because they lack the requisite skills.\n\n   43.       Nevertheless, the consequences vary greatly depending on the\n   host country and the immigrant population.\n\n   44.       As a general rule, unemployment rates among non-EU immigrant\n   populations are much higher than among the indigenous populations, and\n   this even applies to immigrants who have obtained their host country's\n   nationality. Unfortunately, all too often severe discrimination in\n   employment matters can be noted, although European legislation seeks\n   to counter such practices. However, discrimination is sometimes\n   difficult to prove, since employers rarely admit to it and cite other\n   reasons for failing to recruit people of foreign origin. In some\n   countries, particularly France, pressure groups are taking steps to\n   test recruitment practices using \"anonymised\" CVs, which initially\n   show neither the name, the place of birth nor a photograph of job\n   applicants but merely state their qualifications and occupational\n   experience, to assess the role which \"gut reactions\" on purely racial\n   or ethnic grounds play in foreigners' recruitment difficulties. To\n   overcome the ever-present problem of unemployment among immigrant\n   populations it is also essential to bear in mind the vital importance\n   of education: mastery of the host country's language and obtaining\n   training, if possible in keeping with labour market demand, are\n   prerequisites if the problems posed by an under-qualified labour force\n   are to be avoided. This is naturally a message which can be conveyed\n   more easily and more effectively to school children.\n\n   45.       Family reunion of immigrants from Muslim regions raises the\n   same problems throughout Europe, as integration of women in the labour\n   market and, more generally, in community life collides with tradition,\n   which can also curb the integration of children, particularly girls.\n   Fortunately, increasing numbers of Maghrebi women, for instance, are\n   militating for reconciling loyalty to their original culture in the\n   private sphere with the exercise of all their civic rights. Such\n   efforts can succeed provided that the host State ensures that the\n   universal rights secured for all persons present in the territory of\n   the 46 member States of the Council of Europe under the European\n   Convention on Human Rights take precedence over the influence of those\n   who presume to regiment the immigrant \"communities\". As for\n   immigration from eastern Europe, in Italy, for example, this mainly\n   involves female immigrants, thus fitting in with a specifically\n   Italian social, economic and cultural reality: most of these women\n   work as cleaners, and especially as home helps. The Italian State has\n   washed its hands of family and old-age policy: Italian families are\n   becoming smaller and smaller, and family assistance is being farmed\n   out to private companies to meet social needs.\n\n   46.       In most European immigration areas female labour centres on\n   local unskilled service activities, at least for the first-generation\n   immigrants. However, many young women of immigrant origin have\n   achieved excellent school results followed by brilliant professional\n   careers, provided that their cultural traditions do not bar them from\n   the educational and training courses that provide the best\n   qualifications.\n\n   47.       We must also consider the social costs of immigration. This\n   is a tricky matter because we must avoid lapsing into caricature and\n   prejudice. Admittedly we do have to combat illegal immigration,\n   beginning by prosecuting the people-smugglers who take advantage of\n   prospective travellers to Europe, showing utter disregard for the very\n   lives of their passengers: no one can forget the 56 Chinese people who\n   died of suffocation in a lorry on their way to Great Britain, the\n   Africans who die while attempting to reach Spain across the Straits of\n   Gibraltar, or the very recent case of the makeshift boats that left a\n   few dozen survivors washed up on the southern shores of Italy, several\n   dozen having drowned during a crossing that had cost them several\n   thousand Euros, etc. Illegal work must also be discouraged, as it\n   jeopardises the unprotected immigrants and distorts the labour market\n   in the host countries.\n\n   48.       Although we must also combat the occasional abuses of the\n   system, with some individuals attempting to live solely from social\n   welfare without making any contribution to the host country's economy,\n   once we have secured effective measures against illegal immigration\n   and have successfully prosecuted the abuses noted, the funds expended\n   on behalf of immigrants must be regarded as an investment which will\n   eventually benefit all the host communities.\n\n   49.       This applies in particular to educational and medical\n   expenditure. Not only will well-educated, healthy people \"integrate\"\n   more easily into the national host communities, but also they will\n   considerably enrich them. Another major side-effect is that they will\n   less easily fall prey to the advocates of fundamentalism and rejection\n   of Western standards, whose hate-filled word are fuelled by\n   frustration. So the individual States must take account of these\n   realities and plan the corresponding expenditure, including social\n   welfare spending.\n\n   50.       Alongside the economic and social consequences of migration,\n   there also arises the central question of immigrant integration in the\n   host societies.\n\n   5.       Integration in the host communities\n\n         5.1.       Possible conceptions of integration\n\n   51.       A variety of conceptions of integration coexist within\n   Europe. We must also look beyond our borders for other possible\n   definitions of integration.\n\n   52.       A range of different policies have been implemented\n   throughout Europe, and all these policies have shown their limits.\n   Although we should bear in mind all the different approaches and\n   possibly use them as a basis for our investigations, they cannot\n   simply be transposed as they stand.\n\n   53.       We must fight shy of any attempt to standardise integration,\n   and instead try to reconcile the various approaches to immigration\n   depending on the traditions and legislation in force in the host\n   States. The main distinction to be drawn is between assimilation of\n   immigrants and communalism or multiculturalism.\n\n   54.       Assimilation - which is inconsistent with the values of the\n   Council of Europe - confines cultural or religious differences to the\n   private sphere and shuns any consideration of \"ethnic origins\".\n   Individuals must blend into the national community. All members of\n   society must share the same social blueprint and common values. They\n   must accept the same laws and enjoy the same rights in accordance with\n   the principles of equality and universality. The optimum indicator for\n   assimilation is where the assimilated individuals' specificities are\n   pushed into the background as a token of their renunciation of certain\n   elements of their original culture and of their integration into a\n   specific community of individuals.\n\n   55.       Conversely, under communalism, which we has never been\n   accurately defined, the specific immigrant community becomes, to some\n   minds, a value at least as important as the universal values of\n   freedom and equality; others would define it as a socio-political\n   project aimed at subjecting the members of a specified group to a set\n   of rules deemed to be specific to this group.\n\n   56.       According to its Latin origin, the concept of integration\n   means \"bringing a part into a whole\". It is one of the essential\n   functions of the social system, ensuring the co-ordination of the\n   various sections of society with a view to guaranteeing the proper\n   functioning of the whole system. For instance, we call a society well\n   integrated if it has a high level of social cohesion, and an\n   individual is deemed to be well integrated if he or she shares the\n   values and norms of the society to which he or she belongs. By\n   definition, integration involves all the interactions between the\n   members of society, giving rise to a feeling of identification with\n   the group and its values.\n\n   57.       In France, the Higher Council for Integration, set up in\n   1990, describes integration not as a medium term between assimilation\n   and mere insertion but as a specific process prompting active\n   participation in national society by a variety of different elements,\n   while at the same time accepting the continuation of cultural, social\n   and moral specificities and holding that the whole is enriched by such\n   diversity and complexity. Instead of negating differences, a proper\n   integration policy takes account of them without exalting them, and\n   emphasises the similarities and convergences in order, with equality\n   of rights and obligations, to establish solidarity among the different\n   ethnic and cultural components of society and to enable everyone,\n   whatever his or her origin, to live in this society, whose rules he or\n   she has accepted and of which he or she has become a component\n   part.\n\n   58.       The United Kingdom has been seen as a laboratory for testing\n   integration issues. During the post-war period, when the\n   decolonisation process was providing an effective stimulus to\n   immigration, the country was at first determined to assimilate these\n   newcomers, granting them all civic, social and political rights on\n   their entry into the national territory. Subsequently, after the first\n   race riots broke out in the 1960s, the British Government noted that\n   formal assimilation was not having the desired effect: it lacked a\n   social strand, a real access to work. The UK definition of\n   integration, as laid down in 1966, highlighted cultural diversity and\n   equality of opportunity in a climate of mutual tolerance. The UK\n   abandoned assimilation in favour of a new \"Race Relations\" concept:\n   equal opportunities for all, against a background of cultural\n   diversity and mutual tolerance, thus ushering in the multicultural era\n   in Britain. For about a decade now, and more acutely since the turn of\n   the millennium, this model has been under renewed scrutiny, the finger\n   being pointed at the lack of values shared by all and of any real\n   common feeling of \"Britishness\". This has been compounded since 2001\n   with the problems of combating terrorism. Large numbers of Muslim\n   immigrants have been arriving in the country, giving rise to questions\n   concerning their allegiance: with police action against terrorist\n   plots and subversive \"sermons\" by certain \"religious\" leaders and the\n   rise of populism and xenophobia, the United Kingdom is casting around\n   for a fresh approach in integration policy.\n\n   59.       The German priority has been integration through the labour\n   market, involving the trade unions and works councils. So there is a\n   high level of unionisation, which makes for good working conditions:\n   the unionisation rate for German nationals is 36%, with 50% for Turks\n   living in Germany and 43% for other foreigners. Changes to the\n   nationality law, which now combines the jus sanguinis tradition with\n   some elements of jus loci, should encourage access by Turks, in\n   particular, to German nationality, thus improving their chances of\n   integration.\n\n   60.       Italy is apparently attempting to integrate its immigrants,\n   although this attempt is unlikely to succeed in the long term: it\n   periodically regularises a number of illegal immigrants, but stops\n   short of forcing employers to re-recruit legally their former\n   undeclared workers, thus promoting unemployment and maintaining the\n   moonlighting mindset. Italy advocates the right to difference rather\n   than assimilation.\n\n   61.       Moving on beyond the borders of Europe, we might take a look\n   at the American and Canadian models^11. They conduct an active and\n   intensive policy in favour of a high level of immigration. The new\n   arrivals find it difficult to adapt because of their origins:\n   language, culture, religion and wide socio-economic discrepancies,\n   reaching both ends of the spectrum (low standard of education and\n   resources for some, and high qualifications and wealth for others).\n\n   62.       In 1971 Canada adopted an official multiculturalist policy.\n   Training is provided in the official languages, the courses initially\n   being confined to the workers themselves but subsequently being\n   extended to their spouses and children. The State funds various aid\n   agencies and runs reception programmes in order to provide immigrants\n   with day-today support. However, aid policy still centres primarily on\n   language assistance. Immigrants are entitled to integration assistance\n   after one year's residence in the national territory. However, the\n   plan to transfer specified powers wielded by the civil courts to\n   community \"tribunals\" organised according to the specific standards of\n   each immigrant group is causing some concern. For instance, Muslim\n   \"tribunals\" would be able to apply Sharia law to Muslim communities,\n   covering marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc. Given that Canada is a\n   State that enjoys observer status with the Council of Europe, it is\n   undesirable that it permit the implementation in its territory of\n   standards which not only contradict the spirit of the European\n   Convention on Human Rights but above all negate the principle of\n   equality between women and men, a field in which Canada was one of the\n   pioneers.\n\n   63.       The United States of America traditionally takes a passive\n   attitude to immigrants. From the outset there has been a clear\n   determination to exclude individuals unable to provide for themselves,\n   and so the State has never introduced any kind of assistance\n   programme. Minor support programmes have gradually grown up, although\n   no real resources have been earmarked for them. A radical reform of\n   the welfare system was launched in 1996, leading to a situation where\n   non-citizens have no access to social programmes until they have been\n   in residence for at least five years.\n\n   64.       President Carter introduced an urban renewal policy in order\n   to rehabilitate the major city centres, where the poorest groups are\n   traditionally concentrated, ie Afro-Americans, Hispanics and new\n   immigrants, and to promote a mingling of populations in both racial\n   and economic terms. The various communities are being encouraged to\n   integrate as both confidence-building agencies and driving forces for\n   integration by improving economic and social living conditions.\n\n   65.       The United States presents a virtually unprecedented\n   paradox: as a country created through immigration by European groups\n   fleeing religious persecution, it has gradually taken in immigrants of\n   all origins: Irish people fleeing the famine, Jews fleeing the pogroms\n   of eastern Europe and Nazism, followed by defectors from countries\n   oppressed by communism: Russians, Cambodians and Chinese, including\n   their top scientists. There were also Cubans. Finally the \"economic\n   refugees\" started slipping in across the Mexican border or took their\n   chance with the Lottery which each year officially attributed tens of\n   thousands of residence permits. The fact is that these groups show a\n   striking attachment to their host country, the first glimpse of which\n   for many of them is Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty looming over the\n   entrance to New York harbour.\n\n   66.       The United States, no doubt anchored in this self-image as a\n   refuge for people fleeing religious persecution, is, in principle, in\n   favour of freedom for groups claiming specific belonging to a\n   community, which freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment to the\n   Constitution and the established case-law of the Supreme Court. The\n   acceptance of independently organised groups, including those\n   operating along ethnic lines, has probably been reinforced by the\n   recent realisation of the extermination of the American Indians and\n   the anti-Black discrimination which still continues a century after\n   the abolition of slavery. From Indian reservations to affirmative\n   action, successive American administration have therefore granted\n   specific rights to these groups, which have been rechristened Native\n   Americans and Afro-Americans.\n\n   67.       Nevertheless, a number of minor conflicts have demonstrated\n   that common rules can prevail over specificities, even when they are\n   presented as a religious cornerstone: the prohibition of polygamy\n   among the Mormons, and the obligation for women to produce bare-headed\n   identity photographs, regardless of any Islamic precepts to the\n   contrary. The trauma of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks has,\n   to put it mildly, weakened this tolerance vis- -vis all faiths, as\n   witness the drastic controls effected on entrance to the United\n   States, extending to both prospective immigrants and tourists. The\n   various communities' freedom of internal organisation, inter alia\n   along religious lines, will no doubt remain, but nor is there any\n   doubt that the experience of terrorism on US soil will lead to greater\n   caution about any demands liable to undermine a nation which glories\n   in the motto \"Ex pluribus unum\". This might in fact lead to a question\n   American understanding of the European approaches to the problem.\n\n   68.       France is often presented as the model of anti-communalism,\n   rejecting collective rights in favour of individual rights as a\n   guarantee of equality and universality. French policy in this field\n   has long been based on a desire to cut back on the \"ethnicisation\" of\n   suburban areas. The French tradition of centralisation is unitarian in\n   thrust and would therefore seem to militate against the development of\n   any potentially divisive specificities. France has no racially\n   oriented tradition, something which is precluded by its highly\n   individual conception of secularism. Open references to race are\n   difficult to imagine, and in fact these are only just beginning to see\n   the light of day with the tentative emergence of \"positive\n   discrimination\", under pressure from Mr Nicolas Sarkozy. However,\n   there is a genuine desire to implement strong policies on immigration\n   and integration, with respect for specifically French republican\n   traditions. For instance, as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy pointed out at a\n   recent colloquy on migration organised at the suggestion of our\n   Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population, French society has\n   perfectly well absorbed successive waves of immigration in the past,\n   inter alia from Spain and Portugal, which helped the latter countries\n   to achieve economic stability and become major European States. This\n   justifies the conclusion that the enlargement of Europe will not\n   create any major risks in terms of migration flow. But it does not\n   mean that we must refrain from controlling immigration. France has\n   adopted this approach by reforming its asylum laws and legislation on\n   illegal immigration, which will enable it to provide better facilities\n   for lawfully settled aliens.\n\n   69.       Much can be learned from the integration experiences of the\n   new EU member states. Although accessible data are still in short\n   supply, there can be no denying that these countries too have faced\n   problems of integration, or reintegration. The partitioning of eastern\n   Europe after the Second World War created administrative borders that\n   had little in common with the pre-war borders, within which people of\n   the same ethnic origin had been grouped together. As a result, after\n   the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent reorganisation, masses\n   of people crossed the former geographical borders to regain their\n   homelands and/or nations of origin. Their reintegration was not always\n   easy, since they had sometimes developed very different behaviour\n   patterns and attitudes depending on the regimes under which they had\n   lived. The most striking example of such differences is naturally that\n   of the two Germanys. The Hungarian experience in such matters is\n   nonetheless worth noting, although it differs radically from the\n   situation recently encountered in the EU's founder states: in Hungary\n   the newcomers spoke the language and shared the host country's culture\n   and history.\n\n   70.       In conclusion, it is important to note that integration is a\n   dynamic process that can work both ways, each side deriving enrichment\n   from the other's differences, as long as it takes place in accordance\n   with the host country's traditional values.\n\n   71.       Obviously, any analysis of the concept of integration must\n   include consideration of a phenomenon which often emerges alongside\n   immigration, that is racism.\n\n         5.2.       Racism\n\n   72.       Ever since the 1980s Europe has been facing immigration of a\n   type no longer aimed at providing labour or strictly deriving from\n   decolonisation. This new type of immigration was neither desired nor\n   deemed necessary for economic reasons. This was the starting point for\n   a feeling which sometimes escalated to the point of total rejection of\n   persons, based on racial criteria.\n\n   73.       Racism varies in accordance with the individual country's\n   history, culture and economic situation. It also varies according to\n   the period in history. It is often combine with anti-Semitism.\n\n   74.       In the second half of the 20^th century the racist\n   phenomenon began to develop into something slightly more presentable\n   and less obviously reprehensible. This \"valeting\" of racism derived\n   from the immigration policies being implemented, from public support\n   for various ostensibly acceptable theses, and from a swing towards\n   acceptance of the exclusion of the Other, of those who are different.\n\n   75.       This meant defining the national identity with reference to\n   a traditional hardcore made up of a shared history, culture and\n   language, which is by definition inaccessible to anyone not born in\n   the country in question. According to some theories, \"outsiders\" are\n   even seen as a threat to the national identity, possibly presenting\n   the nation with the need to defend itself. It is significant, for\n   instance, that the building of mosques, which some regard as a sign of\n   integration, demonstrating the will to stay in a given country while\n   also freely exercising one's religion, as is traditionally provided\n   for in national constitutions, is seen by others as a determination\n   not to integrate, disavowal of the nation's traditional values.\n\n   76.       The media can also be a powerful intermediary for racism in\n   that they can manipulate public opinion on the basis of facts often\n   taken out of context, or else by overemphasising certain theories or\n   offences which signally fail to reflect the loyal attitude of most\n   immigrants. In 1985 in France, for instance, a high-circulation\n   national newspaper terrified the public with a sensational front page\n   headline asking \"Will we still be French in thirty years' time?\". More\n   recently, a BBC commentator lapsed into some very unfortunate jibes\n   against \"Arabs\", which led to his resignation but which had sufficient\n   impact on public opinion for quite a few Britons to fall in behind\n   him.\n\n   77.       With the current high level of immigration, there is a\n   consensus that a system of immigrant selection will become necessary\n   in European countries. Such selection must be accompanied with\n   guarantees on non-discrimination^15, or at the very least on a\n   prohibition of any kind of discrimination that lacks objective,\n   legitimate foundations such as possession of a given job\n   specialisation or a specific qualification or diploma. The criteria\n   for such selection should be completely transparent, reasoned and\n   proportional. We must at all events welcome the reinforcement of\n   legislation against racist comments and all forms of discrimination,\n   as well as the strict application of the European Convention on Human\n   Rights to all persons present in the territory of any of the Council\n   of Europe States, whatever their nationality, gender or origin.\n\n         5.3.       How can integration be encouraged?\n\n         5.3.1.       By establishing genuine immigration policies\n\n   78.       In the past few years most European states have toughened up\n   their immigration policies and strengthened the link between access to\n   legal immigration and a commitment to integration on the part of\n   would-be immigrants. Such a commitment, which is very often written\n   into the law, is presented as an essential precondition for improving\n   their administrative situation or acquiring additional rights. In some\n   countries, the granting of a residence permit is conditional upon\n   signing an \"integration contract\".\n\n   79.       In Denmark, for example, the law of July 2002 stipulates\n   that a permanent residence permit and the related social benefits may\n   not be granted until after a period of seven years of legal residence\n   in the country, instead of three years previously. This permit is\n   issued subject to passing Danish language, culture and history tests\n   and a written undertaking to \"comply with local legislation\".\n   Furthermore, Danish nationality is granted only after nine years of\n   legal residence in the country, as compared with seven years\n   previously.\n\n   80.       In Austria, the new immigration act, in force since January\n   2003, requires newly arrived non EU nationals or those who have been\n   living in the country for less than five years to sign an integration\n   contract under which they are obliged to learn the national language\n   and familiarise themselves with national customs. Immigrants who fail\n   the examination twice may have their residence permit withdrawn.\n   Furthermore, knowledge of the German language is now compulsory for\n   the acquisition of Austrian nationality.\n\n   81.       In the United Kingdom, but also in the Netherlands, all\n   newly admitted immigrants must now participate in an \"integration\n   programme\". In the United Kingdom, as well as having a command of\n   English, immigrants must know how institutions work and show an\n   understanding of British culture and civic life. They must take a\n   citizenship test prior to integration. \"Citizenship ceremonies\" are\n   now held at which applicants swear allegiance to the Queen and pledge\n   to uphold the country's laws and democratic values. Candidates for\n   British nationality must sit a language test.\n\n   82.       In France, the strong tradition of taking in immigrants and\n   asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of full acquisition of\n   citizenship. France took in some 200,000 stable new arrivals in 2002.\n   At the same time, 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were\n   naturalised, thus gaining access to all the rights of French citizens.\n   As in the other countries of Europe, however, such a policy cannot be\n   maintained and extended unless it is accompanied by a clear\n   distinction between legal and illegal immigration. Two new laws were\n   accordingly passed at the end of 2003, one relating to the control of\n   immigration and the residence of foreigners in France, the other\n   relating to the right of asylum. Measures have been taken to make the\n   requirements for obtaining a visa stricter, new penalties have been\n   introduced for those who employ illegal immigrants, and the new\n   offence of organising marriages of convenience has been created. At\n   the same time, the asylum system has been unified around the OFPRA\n   (Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) in order\n   to create better conditions for examining applications and reduce the\n   time taken to complete the procedure, while at the same time enabling\n   a larger number of applicants to be eligible for refugee status. The\n   \"French model\" is also based on a distinction between the private and\n   public spheres. In the former, all the cultural or religious\n   traditions which link immigrants to their country of origin may be\n   expressed, provided they respect the fundamental rights of\n   individuals. In the public sphere, public services and schools in\n   particular are governed by the principle of secularity, which has made\n   possible the peaceful co-existence of groups who clashed throughout\n   the 19th century, almost to the point of civil war, on religious\n   grounds. This is no doubt one of the options that could be suggested\n   to certain states which are deeply divided between ethnic and\n   religious groups caught up in an endless vendetta, resulting in\n   countless deaths and constituting a fatal obstacle to economic\n   development amid the spiral of poverty and hatred.\n\n   83.       The European Union is tending to take over from its member\n   states' national policies in order to ensure harmonisation of the law\n   of asylum and the conditions for legally entering the EU area. The\n   European Union supplements this approach through agreements with the\n   \"close neighbours\". The Justice and Home Affairs Directorate deals\n   with migration, among other things. It has been given new powers since\n   the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question of integration has come to the\n   fore at European level in the past two years. The aim is not\n   necessarily that Europe should choose an integration model, but that\n   it should adopt a pragmatic approach: identify good integration\n   practices, in a context of respect for European values, while ensuring\n   a balance between immigrants' rights and obligations.\n\n         5.3.2.       By combating forms of exclusion\n\n   84.       The causes of integration difficulties are complex and\n   depend to a great extent on immigrants' cultural and social origins\n   and the host society's political and cultural traditions. Immigrants\n   very often observe cultural, religious or social traditions which\n   differ from the democratic values upheld by the host state. The\n   integration process is made even more difficult by the fact that, very\n   often, the usual instruments promoting social cohesion, such as access\n   to the labour market, to the civil service or to schools genuinely\n   encouraging an ethnic mix and social advancement, are largely closed\n   to immigrants.\n\n   85.       Today, in most Council of Europe member states, certain\n   communities play little or no part in the social, cultural or\n   political structures of the host society and feel that they are\n   victims of economic and racial discrimination, and these groups are\n   very often concentrated in areas suffering from social deprivation.\n   Hence these communities live in isolation in their neighbourhoods and\n   continue to observe their customs and their way of life, which they\n   hand down to, and sometimes impose on, their children. The latter,\n   caught between two cultures, feel out of place and question their\n   identity. Faced with problems of social integration, immigrants,\n   whether new arrivals or members of the second and third generations,\n   react very badly to exclusion, by rejecting the values of the host\n   society. This leads to a feeling of social malaise and very often to\n   the development of delinquency, particularly among young people, and,\n   concurrently, the development of extremism.\n\n   86.       Generally speaking, there is a lack of social cohesion if\n   the state's authority is challenged, if the state's standards and\n   values are not recognised or if individuals are poorly integrated into\n   the economy. There is a social fracture when a minority as such\n   excludes itself from the community. This kind of \"ethnic\" isolation\n   encourages community domination of certain neighbourhoods, and even\n   the rise of religious fundamentalism. This situation entails dangers\n   because it generates social tensions and weakens social cohesion and\n   democratic values founded on equality of rights, duties and\n   opportunities.\n\n   87.       Most European countries have been confronted with violent\n   demonstrations by young people living in sensitive urban\n   neighbourhoods. Sociological research has shown that these protests\n   are the violent expression of a desire for social recognition on the\n   part of a population relegated to the fringes of society, frustrated\n   in its aspirations by a public order viewed solely in terms of its\n   repressive function. As a general rule, these protests express a\n   demand for greater equality, integration and social advancement. Some\n   neighbourhoods on the urban periphery are victims of agitation by\n   individuals who exploit these frustrations and seek to impose their\n   \"own values\" and oppose any intrusion by law enforcement officials.\n   States must endeavour to combat these phenomena, of which the\n   inhabitants of these neighbourhoods, in particular young immigrants,\n   are the first victims.\n\n         5.3.3.       Through social responses to exclusion\n\n   88.       Lawful immigrants form an integral part of our societies and\n   their effective participation in the state machinery is an essential\n   precondition for guaranteeing lasting social cohesion. It is indeed\n   undesirable that, by reason of their ethnic origin, certain population\n   groups within a country should be lastingly excluded from some aspects\n   of state affairs. The efforts to combat discrimination in employment\n   matters are an example of what can be done. These efforts must be\n   extended to many other areas, although, in the Rapporteur 's\n   contention, it is not necessarily scandalous that some types of jobs\n   (in the armed forces or the judiciary, for instance) should be the\n   preserve of nationals. Nonetheless, this should not constitute a\n   ground for excluding these population groups from jobs where\n   nationality criteria are no longer justified (for example, in France\n   surveyors must still be of French nationality).\n\n   89.       In a communication dated 3 June 2003, the European\n   Commission suggested defining integration as \"a two-way process based\n   on mutual rights and corresponding obligations of legally resident\n   third country nationals and the host society which provides for full\n   participation of immigrants\".\n\n   90.       Essentially, integration policies should be policies of\n   encouragement, aid and support, integration being a long-term,\n   voluntary process which is sometimes difficult and which often\n   concerns the first and second generations. The support aspect concerns\n   the learning of the language of the host country, education for\n   children and vocational training for young people.\n\n   91.       Because it is a decision to belong, integration presupposes\n   a policy to inform would-be immigrants about their rights and\n   obligations. Everyone has the right to respect for their identity, but\n   they are also under an obligation, whatever their traditions and\n   customs, to respect the principles and law of the host state, and to\n   recognise and display, through their behaviour, the fact that they\n   belong to that state. Integration means respecting imported cultures\n   and peoples' identities, provided they do not challenge the\n   foundations of the host society's culture and their manifestations do\n   not violate public order or other people's rights and freedoms. In\n   this connection, we should welcome the recent decision by the European\n   Court of Human Rights setting limits on certain demands based on\n   religious traditions in the light of the need for protection of other\n   people's rights and freedoms, of public order viewed as an obligation\n   for the authorities to preserve public peace, and, lastly, the\n   principle of equality between men and women.\n\n   92.       The state must see to the provision of economic, social and\n   cultural conditions that facilitate the integration of new arrivals\n   who have entered its territory legally and of immigrants who have been\n   established for several years. Generally speaking, it is by regarding\n   immigrants as persons holding rights and, where appropriate, able to\n   acquire full citizenship through naturalisation, that we shall give\n   them the opportunity to become integrated without abandoning their\n   identity. The state must take appropriate legislative measures to\n   fight all discriminatory practices and measures against immigrant\n   communities, on grounds of racial, ethnic or religious origin, whether\n   in terms of access to employment, working conditions or access to\n   housing. Conversely, the state must punish all incitement to hatred on\n   the part of any individual, even from an immigrant background. States\n   must maintain their policies of social development in sensitive urban\n   neighbourhoods and support the initiatives of immigrants'\n   representative organisations, which play a crucial role in the process\n   of integration and social cohesion. They must also develop curricula\n   emphasising the concepts of citizenship, respect for differences,\n   social tolerance and, most importantly, respect for the guarantees of\n   the European Convention on Human Rights and for the principle of\n   equality, particularly between men and women. They can encourage\n   awareness-raising campaigns to promote intercultural dialogue. They\n   can also highlight positive examples of social advancement in various\n   fields, or examples of immigrants or descendants of immigrants who\n   have held political office.\n\n   93.       States should focus particular attention on improving the\n   situation of immigrant women by according them specific rights, access\n   to education and the labour market and real respect for their\n   individual freedoms in the context of equality between men and women,\n   including protection from \"customs\" that are contrary to public order\n   and to Council of Europe conventions. The achievement of equal rights\n   offers prospects for development which will spread to the societies of\n   origin, with which these women retain links: changes in the status of\n   women are the key to development in emigration countries, with control\n   by women of their fertility, their health and that of their family,\n   and with the guarantee of education and, above all, literacy skills\n   being passed on. Failure in these areas would encourage communities to\n   turn in on themselves.\n\n         5.3.4.       Reconciling integration and the fight against\n   terrorism\n\n   94.       This has been a crucial issue since the events of 11\n   September 2001. Europe is under serious threat from Islamist groups\n   who threaten to carry out actions within its frontiers, as they have\n   done in Munich, Paris, Berlin and, on 11 March 2004, Madrid. At the\n   same time, Europe is under potential threat from population groups\n   already present on its territory. This is because they may be faced\n   with a choice between loyalty to a given group, in this case the host\n   country and nation, and possible allegiance to the causes promoted by\n   terrorist groups. It is espousal of such causes which is likely to\n   seriously endanger the host state. That is why the policies governing\n   border controls and controls inside Europe have been tightened. Such\n   policies are essential, but should remain in line with the positions\n   traditionally defended by the Council of Europe.\n\n   95.       When rebellions are fuelled by subversive groups with the\n   aim of carrying out terrorist attacks, states have a duty, while\n   complying with constitutional rules and the European Convention on\n   Human Rights, to take appropriate precautions, including international\n   police and judicial co-operation, in the interests of those immigrants\n   who aspire to live in peace in their host country and who publicly\n   distance themselves from the terrorist groups, with which, therefore,\n   they should not be indiscriminately associated.\n\n   96.       It is important not to give way to hate. In many\n   non-European countries, the fight against terrorism has led to the\n   flouting of basic rights. Even in Europe, political leaders have a\n   responsibility to refrain from the kind of discourse that would fuel\n   racism among the population and detract from the effectiveness of\n   existing integration policies.\n\n   5.3.5.       Co-development: aid to the third world with the long-term\n       aim of discouraging emigration and encouraging immigrants to\n       return to their countries of origin\n\n   97.       It has been accepted for decades that the wealthiest\n   countries have a duty to contribute to the economic and social\n   development of third world countries, notably by earmarking a certain\n   proportion of their gross domestic product for this purpose: we are\n   forced to conclude that this amount, despite representing only a small\n   percentage, has never been paid in full; as a result, the beneficial\n   consequences this might have had have not taken place. But there are\n   other factors too, one of them being the failings of certain third\n   world elites.\n\n   98.       According to some commentators, the aid which has\n   nevertheless been granted has been a resounding failure because the\n   countries which have not received any are now rising economic powers\n   (China, and more generally, south-east Asia), whereas the countries\n   which have been \"drip fed\", in particular the former colonies of\n   European countries, are more than ever third world nations,\n   experiencing situations of famine or war, or indeed recession, which\n   were unheard of in the days of colonisation. In Africa, for example,\n   GDP is lower today than it was in 1980. The aid granted sometimes\n   falls over 90% short of the target. Worse still, aid programmes have\n   very often hindered the reforms needed to adapt to changes in economic\n   life, causing a lag in development which it is very difficult for\n   these countries to make up.\n\n   99.       Aid policies have changed: they are aimed less at improving\n   infrastructure than at promoting an institutional climate suitable for\n   encouraging private investment and employment-creating small\n   businesses: improved public order and security, education, health,\n   more efficient public services etc.\n\n   100.       In this connection, the urgent need to help third world\n   countries to fight the AIDS epidemic which is rampant there cannot be\n   overlooked: it is one of the keys to their survival, and to ours.\n\n   101.       On the other hand, the development of micro-credit, which\n   enables women, in particular, to set up businesses which will provide\n   a livelihood for the whole family, has been a quite outstanding and\n   heartening success, and should be continued.\n\n   102.       Lastly, it should be noted that some countries which have a\n   large diaspora in another country, such as Morocco in France for\n   example, have a real policy towards this emigrant population. In fact,\n   Morocco has a minister responsible for Moroccans living abroad, whose\n   duties include guaranteeing full citizenship to emigrants and\n   involving the diaspora in the economic development of the country of\n   origin.\n\n   103.       Co-development policies must be part and parcel of our\n   overall approach to integration. Although co-development is not a\n   factor which directly affects the integration of immigrant populations\n   within our borders, it would be a good thing if it influenced\n   migratory movements upstream, since, as we have seen above, something\n   must be done to attempt to regulate these movements. Co-development is\n   one means of doing so. By encouraging people to stay in their home\n   country, naturally under conditions that are as consistent as possible\n   with the Council of Europe's values, or inciting them to return there\n   under such conditions, certain population flows towards our countries\n   can be stemmed, while at the same time improving development prospects\n   in other countries by avoiding a brain-drain of their most qualified\n   young people.\n\n         5.3.6 Towards a concept of citizenship?\n\n   104.       The countries of Europe remain divided on some issues: one\n   of which is the concept of citizenship. Some are ready to enhance the\n   possibilities for immigrants to acquire citizens' rights: this is the\n   case, inter alia, in France with regard to social rights, since no\n   distinction based on nationality is drawn in granting welfare\n   benefits; such a distinction is in fact officially prohibited, as the\n   administrative courts regularly point out, in that all persons\n   resident in the country are entitled to minimum standards of social\n   protection. Other states do not fully concur with this position and\n   have introduced duration of stay and/or language proficiency\n   requirements. Yet others would like to go further by giving immigrants\n   more rights, moving towards full citizenship - in particular, and this\n   is often a source of problems, the right to vote in all elections.\n\n   105.       This is still a very divisive issue. By officialising\n   various levels of citizenship (local, regional, national,\n   supranational or transnational), European law itself does not offer\n   any quick solutions to this lack of consensus.\n\n   106.       Each state is jealous of its own concept of citizenship and\n   would like it to either take precedence over others or be preserved\n   for national use. However, some, albeit partial and slow, progress can\n   be noted. France's example is quite telling in this respect:\n   secularity and the concept of the \"French people\" are two particularly\n   important notions in France and underlie much of French legislation.\n   Nonetheless, after many unfruitful attempts, with the courts showing a\n   considerable reluctance to change the case-law, bordering on\n   stubbornness, it has been possible to amend the concept of the \"French\n   people\". France long held back from ratifying the Council of Europe's\n   Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1992. In 1996 the\n   Conseil d'Etat even held that the charter was incompatible with the\n   French Constitution. In the end France signed the charter in 1999, but\n   did not ratify it because the courts set great store by the concept of\n   the \"French people\", making it absolutely impossible to recognise the\n   existence of minorities within French territory. In March 2003,\n   Article 1 of the Constitution was at last amended, to the effect that\n   the Republic remained indivisible but its organisation was\n   decentralised. This reform, passed without any general debate, is a\n   sign of some initial progress in the way France conceives nationality\n   and citizenship.\n\n   6.       Conclusions and recommendations\n\n   107.       In your Rapporteur's view, it is important to preserve the\n   Council of Europe's fundamental values within its member states in the\n   context of measures to be taken to promote the integration of\n   immigrants.\n\n   108.       All the Council of Europe member states should therefore be\n   reminded of what these values are, to provide them with a yardstick\n   for assessing the legislation they are, or will be, implementing not\n   only in the field of integration but also in that of the fight against\n   terrorism or the fight against illegal immigration, since it has been\n   shown that these form part of the same debate in the current world\n   context.\n\n   109.       The Council of Europe's fundamental values - a commitment\n   to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual freedoms,\n   and the promotion of the European cultural diversity - should provide\n   a common basis for all those who live in Europe, citizens or\n   immigrants.\n\n   110.       Your Rapporteur gained the impression that the populations\n   of the first 15 European Union member states had not yet gauged the\n   full significance of the arrival of ten new countries last spring: in\n   particular, better information would be desirable to ensure that these\n   new populations joining the EU are no longer regarded by public\n   opinion as immigrants from outside the community, but as fully-fledged\n   members of the EU.\n\n   111.       In addition, all countries, and especially the new EU\n   member states, should be encouraged to put in place and implement\n   reliable instruments for measuring migration flows on their territory.\n\n   112.       The questions of immigration and integration should be the\n   subject of an in-depth debate in all the member states so that all\n   opinions can be heard, and not only the most extremist views, as is\n   very often the case, in the absence of any marked political will in\n   this area.\n\n   113.       The principle of controlling immigration should be\n   established, in particular so as to avoid receiving a massive influx\n   of immigrants which our labour market would be unable to absorb,\n   particularly as a result of industrial relocation outside Europe.\n   Indeed, it is inconceivable not to be able to guarantee new arrivals\n   decent living conditions in terms of our own values.\n\n   114.       Measures to combat illegal immigration, mafia-type networks\n   and human trafficking organisations should be extended to all the\n   Council's member states.\n\n   115.       Inspiration should also be drawn from good practices\n   observed in many member states, and it should be proposed that they be\n   extended or adapted to the others. For example:\n\n   i.       an attempt should be made to achieve Europe-wide\n   harmonisation of asylum law and controls on illegal immigration,\n   drawing inspiration, for example, from the courageous and ambitious\n   reforms carried out in France;\n\n   ii.       provisions should be introduced requiring immigrants to\n   complete a transitional period of residence in the country in order to\n   qualify for a residence permit and social benefits, as in Denmark;\n\n   iii..       it should be ensured that immigrants learn the language of\n   the host country and familiarise themselves with its culture, as in\n   Austria.\n\n   116.       Steps should be taken to ensure that the authority of\n   states does not come under challenge from, for example, fundamentalist\n   movements: for instance by systematically balancing demands for\n   respect for imported cultures and identities against fundamental\n   principles such as those of public order, equality between men and\n   women and recognition of the very foundations of the host state's\n   culture.\n\n   117.       If public opinion in the member states of the Council of\n   Europe is against immigrants, there can be no real integration. It is\n   accordingly necessary to promote reliable, clear information\n   campaigns, not liable to racist or xenophobic manipulation, concerning\n   the issue of migration and the culture, traditions and integration\n   problems of immigrants.\n\n   118.       Lastly, aid should be provided to help countries to retain\n   populations who, previously, very often had no choice but to go into\n   \"economic exile\", or encourage these people to return to their\n   countries of origin in decent economic and social conditions.\n\n   119.       Similarly, where a former conflict area has achieved\n   lasting stability and a regime in keeping with the Council of Europe's\n   democratic values has been established, measures should be devised to\n   encourage the voluntary return of immigrants from these countries to\n   their countries of origin.\n\n   120.       In conclusion, although, in the current world context, your\n   Rapporteur does not entertain any misplaced optimism regarding the\n   question of integration, is not pessimistic in the long term about the\n   ability of European countries to reconcile integration and the Council\n   of Europe's fundamental values. As the history of Europe has shown,\n   with time integration has eventually been achieved in the best\n   interests of each population.\n\n   121.       It is sincerely to be hoped that the context of terrorism\n   prevailing at present around the world is not long-lasting and does\n   not irremediably damage the ability of individuals to accept others.\n\n   Reporting Committee: Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population.\n\n   Reference to committee: Doc. 9948, Reference No. 2883 of 25 November\n   2003.\n\n   Draft resolution unanimously adopted by the Committee on 6 December\n   2004.\n\n   Members of the Committee: Mr John Wilkinson (Chairperson), Mrs Tana\n   de Zulueta (1^st Vice-Chairperson), MM Sren Sndergaard (2^nd\n   Vice-Chairperson), Jean-Guy Branger (3^rd Vice-Chairperson), Pedro\n   Agramunt, Mrs Lale Akgn, MM Gulamhuseyn Alibeyli, Jozef Bernik,\n   Akhmed Bilalov, Ms Oksana Bilozir, Mrs Mimount Bousakla, MM Ivan\n   Brajovic, Mrton Braun, Christian Brunhart, Mevlt avusoglu, Doros\n   Christodoulides, Boriss Cilevics, Mrs Minodora Cliveti, Mrs Elvira\n   Cortajarena, MM Franco Danieli, Joseph Debono Grech, Taulant Dedja,\n   Nikolaos Dendias, Sergejus Dmitrijevas, Karl Donabauer, Mats\n   Einarsson, Mrs Lydie Err, Mr Valeriy Fedorov, Ms Daniela Filipiov, MM\n   Karl Theodor Freiherr von und zu Guttenberg, Andrzej Grzesik\n   (alternate: Henryk Kroll), Andrzej Grzyb (alternate: Piotr\n   Gadzinowski), Ali Riza Gliek, Michael Hagberg, Michael Hancock, Jim\n   Higgins, Mrs Jelena Hoffmann, MM Ilie Ilascu, Tadeusz Iwinski,\n   Lord Judd, Oleksandr Karpov, Mrs Eleonora Katseli, Evgeni Kirilov,\n   Andr Kvakkestad, Geert Lambert, Jean-Marie Le Guen, Younal Loutfi,\n   Tito Masi, Jean-Pierre Masseret, Ms Nra Nagy, MM Giuseppe Naro,\n   Xhevdet Nasufi, Pasquale Nessa, Kalevi Olin, Pieter Omtzigt,\n   Gheorghe Popa, Virgil Popa, Gabino Puche, Milorad Pupovac, Martin\n   Raguz, Anatoliy Rakhansky, Marc Reymann, Branko Ruzic, Ms Katrin Saks,\n   Mrs Naira Shakhtakhtinskaya (alternate: Mr Bakhtiyar Aliyev), MM ssur\n   Skarphd/insson, Luzi Stamm, Mrs Terezija Stoisits, MM Michael\n   Stbgen, Mehmet Tekelioglu, Mrs Elene Tevdoradze (alternate: Mrs Irine\n   Kurdadz), MM Vojtech Tkc, Tigran Torosyan, Mrs Jelleke Veenendaal,\n   Mr Jos Vera Jardim, Mrs Ruth-Gaby Vermot-Mangold, MM Srgio Vieira,\n   Oldrich Vojr, James Wray, Akhmar Zavgayev, Vladimir Zhirinovsky\n   (alternate: Mrs Vera Oskina).\n\n   N.B.

        "articleBody": "Blood pressure monitors - 5-minute CHOICE\n\n  What to look for\n\n   About one in seven Australian adults suffer from some form of high\n   blood pressure, or hypertension (as it's known medically). If you're\n   one of them, monitoring your condition regularly at home with a blood\n   pressure monitor (and in co-operation with your GP) can be useful.\n      Buy from a pharmacy or medical equipment supplier, where you can\n       get proper advice and a demonstration of how to use the monitor.\n      Arm monitors are generally more accurate than wrist models; in our\n       test, only one wrist model could match them.\n      If you buy an arm monitor, measure your arm size to get the\n       right-size cuff.\n      Make sure the monitor's keys and display are easy to read.\n      Models that inflate the cuff automatically tend to work better\n       than those requiring you to do it manually (by pumping a bulb),\n       though there are exceptions.\n      The cuff has to be inflated to a level above the systolic blood\n       pressure. However, the automatic setting on the monitor may be a\n       lot higher, and you may find it uncomfortable. Models with\n       adjustable inflation level allow you to program the pressure to\n       one that's comfortable for you. Models with fuzzy logic detect the\n       ideal inflation level automatically.\n      If a monitor has a memory to store a number of your recent blood\n       pressure measurements, it can be helpful as a back-up. However,\n       it's a good idea to record all measurements separately, so that\n       you and your GP get a sufficient history.\n      Manufacturers give different advice regarding the use of\n       rechargeable batteries; check in the shop before you buy.\n      While you should use a blood pressure monitor in co-operation with\n       your GP, it's still very helpful if the monitor comes with good\n       general background information on blood pressure issues, for your\n       reference.\n\nWhat's blood pressure?\n\n   Blood pressure is created by the heart pumping blood through the\n   arteries. It's measured as two numbers, in millimetres of mercury\n   (mmHg) based on the standard method using a mercury sphygmomanometer\n   (the machine your doctor uses in their surgery) and a stethoscope;\n   giving a result such as '120 over 80' (120/80 mmHg).\n\n   The higher figure is the systolic pressure, caused by the contracting\n   (beating) heart. The lower figure is called diastolic, and is the\n   pressure between beats, when the heart relaxes.\n\n   Hypertension can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, heart\n   failure and kidney disease, but doesn't necessarily do so. When\n   weighing up your risk, your GP will also consider factors such as your\n   age, sex, family history and weight, and whether you smoke.\n\n   WHO definitions\n   Blood pressure (mmHg)             Diagnosis\n   Up to 120/80                        Optimal\n   Up to 130/85                         Normal\n   Up to 140/90                    High normal\n   Up to 160/100             Mild hypertension\n   Up to 180/110         Moderate hypertension\n   Above 180/110           Severe hypertension\n\nWhat you can do\n\n   Your lifestyle can have an impact on your blood pressure. To prevent\n   hypertension or to manage it once you've been diagnosed:\n      Have regular check-ups, especially when you know you have high\n       blood pressure.\n      Don't smoke.\n      Limit the amount of alcohol you drink.\n      Exercise regularly (but note that there are certain sports to\n       avoid when you have high blood pressure, such as lifting heavy\n       weights). Consider stress-reducing techniques such as yoga and\n       meditation.\n      Avoid salty and fatty foods, and reduce your consumption of red\n       meat.\n      Eat plenty of cereals, fish, fruit and vegetables.\n      Achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.\n      If lifestyle changes don't lower your blood pressure enough, your\n       doctor may prescribe medication. Make sure you take it, and don't\n       adjust the dosage yourself based on your own blood pressure\n       measurements.

Along with the resources we\n   list at the end of this section, you should talk with your doctor\n   about any health situation that gives you concern.\n   \n                        HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY\n\n   I have breast cancer and had been taking hormone replacement therapy.\n   Should I continue to take it?\n\n   Your doctor should advise you about whether to continue HRT (hormone\n   replacement therapy) at the time you are diagnosed with breast cancer.\n   Generally, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for women\n   who have been diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\n   Why would hormone therapy be given to women with breast cancer?\n\n   Researchers have found a way to use hormones as therapy against breast\n   cancer. This is different than HRT (hormone replacement therapy),\n   which is given to imcrease levels of hormones (such as estrogen and\n   progesterone) that are decreased in the body due to menopause.\n\n   One hormone therapy drug for breast cancer is Tamoxifen.  By blocking\n   estrogen, Tamoxifen can block the growth of cancer cells. If your\n   tumor is estrogen receptor positive (called \"ER positive\") this may be\n   a good treatment for your breast cancer.  (Estrogen receptors are\n   found in the nucleus or center of the tumor cell. The ER allows cells\n   to use estrogen to grow).   Tamoxifen can be used alone, with\n   chemotherapy, or following chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is also being used\n   to prevent breast cancers from developing. You may want to ask your\n   doctor about this.\n\n                                 LYMPHEDEMA\n   lymphedema therapists in North Carolina\n\n   What is lymphedema?\n\n   Lymphedema is the collection of lymph fluid that can occur in your arm\n   and hand after your lymph nodes have been removed or damaged from your\n   underarm area (axilla) during breast cancer surgery.\n\n   What is lymph fluid?\n\n   Lymph fluid is a colorless fluid containing the white blood cells that\n   fight infection and disease. Lymph fluid travels through channels of\n   the lymph system throughout your body much like blood travels through\n   arteries and veins.\n\n   What are lymph nodes?\n\n   Lymph nodes are small, pea-sized organs located along the lymph\n   channels. They are grouped in clusters. Their job is to trap foreign\n   bodies such as bacteria or cancer cells to keep them from spreading\n   throughout the body. The nodes are clustered in areas throughout your\n   body such as underams (axilla), groin, neck, chest and abdomen. The\n   ones in your chest and underarm are the ones that collect the lymph\n   fluid from your breast. This is why they are often removed at the time\n   of surgery.\n\n   What causes the arm to swell after surgery?\n\n   Not every woman's arm swells after surgery. It swells because the\n   number of pathways for the lymph to drain from the arm are reduced by\n   the removal of or damage to the lymph tissue during surgery or\n   radiation therapy. Fewer channels to drain the fluid can result in\n   collection of fluid in the arm (or swelling). The extent of lymph\n   tissue removed or damaged relates to how much swelling you may\n   experience. Swelling may occur weeks, months or even years after\n   treatment.\n\n   Are there any safety precautions I should be aware of?\n\n   Yes. Because the lymph channels and nodes have been removed (or\n   decreased) on the side of your surgery, you must take extra caution to\n   protect your hand and arm from injury, cuts, scrapes and insect bites.\n   You may have less protection against infection in that arm. Some\n   people wear a medical alert bracelet with this information on it. It\n   is important to remind healthcare workers to avoid drawing blood and\n   measuring your blood pressure on that arm. It is also recommended that\n   you wear gloves while doing housework, gardening and other activities\n   that may put your arm or hand at risk for injury. In addition, it is\n   possible for lymphedema to occur years after you have finished your\n   treatment; therefore, taking care and being aware are your two best\n   keys to avoiding or managing lymphedema.\n\n   What about using antiperspirant or deodorant under my arm?\n\n   You should not use deodorants or antiperspirants while you are healing\n   from surgery on the armpit on the side of your surgery. Once you are\n   healed, you may use either antiperspirants or deodorants. Some doctors\n   may recommend use of deodorants only. You should talk about this with\n   your healthcare team.\n\n   What can I do about the swelling? Is it permanent?\n\n   You should talk with your doctor about this. Sometimes, elevation of\n   the arm for brief periods throughout the day is adequate to promote\n   fluid drainage. Other methods to reduce swelling include arm exercises\n   and gentle massage that specifically promote lymph drainage. Your\n   doctor should refer you to a practitioner who specializes in\n   lymphedema treatment if you have a persistent problem with this. More\n   severe cases may require use of pressure sleeves to compress the arm.\n   Lymphedema can be a permanent condition in some cases.\n\n   How do I choose a lymphedema therapist?\n\n   Lymphedema therapists have a range of training options. The programs\n   they attend vary in length. When you are choosing a therapist, you\n   might want to consider how much training he or she has.\n\n   The programs include: LeDuc (6 days of training), Lerner (14 days),\n   Casley-Smith(14 days), Academy of Lymphatic Studies (ALS; 14 days),\n   Klose-Norton (15 days), Foldi (20 days), and Vodder (20 days; some\n   programs teach Vodder \"techniques\", but only therapists who\n   have completed the entire program are Vodder credentialed). Recently,\n   the Lymphology Association of North America (LANA) began certifying\n   lymphedema therapists who also passed a comprehensive national exam.\n   If you have questions about the trainings, call the National\n   Lymphedema Network at 800.541.3259 or see http://www.lymphnet.org.\n\n   Also, see the listing of lymphedema therapists in North Carolina in\n   this directory.\n\n   Some questions to ask the lymphedema treatment center\n\n   Does it provide combined decongestive therapy (CDT)? (This includes\n   skin care, manual lymphatic drainage (MLD), bandaging and exercises.)\n\n   What training/experience do its therapists have in CDT?\n\n   Is there a physician with training in lymphedema available for\n   consultation?\n\n   Does the center provide patient education in exercises, skin care,\n   self-massage and self-bandaging?\n\n   Will the initial therapy be done daily, and for how many days?\n   (Generally, therapy is given at least five days in a row for early\n   stage, and up to four weeks if the lymphedema is more advanced.)\n\n   What is Manual Lymph Drainage?\n\n   Manual Lymph Drainage is a massage technique used to improve the flow\n   of lymph using light, rhythmic strokes.  This therapy may be effective\n   for the lymphedema that sometimes follows breast surgery.\n\n\n                                 MENOPAUSE\n                      (Natural & Chemotherapy-Induced)\n\n   What is menopause?\n\n   Menopause is the absence of menstrual periods due to reduced function\n   of the ovaries. This can occur naturally with aging, or from damage to\n   the ovaries. This naturally occurs in women beginning in their 40s and\n   50s.\n\n   Will chemotherapy cause me to experience menopause?\n\n   Before menopause, your ovaries produce estrogen. Estrogen is\n   responsible for your monthly menstrual cycle and reproduction. Some\n   chemotherapy drugs interrupt (temporarily or permanently) ovarian\n   function, which can result in early (or chemotherapy-induced)\n   menopause. This type of menopause can be permanent and has the same\n   effect on your body as naturally-occurring menopause.\n\n   What are some of the typical side effects of menopause?\n\n   Hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and irregularity or\n   absence of monthly menstrual periods are the most common effects of\n   menopause. Menopause is also associated with bone loss due to reduced\n   calcium stores in the bone.\n\n   After chemotherapy treatment, some women resume their menstrual cycle.\n   If you do not, you should seek advice about calcium replacement and\n   exercise to promote bone health.\n\n   What can I do to manage side effects of menopause, such as hot flashes\n   and vaginal dryness?\n\n   You should discuss menopause management strategies with your doctor or\n   nurse. For hot flashes, there are medications available; also, many\n   people are beginning to explore the use of alternative therapies, such\n   as soy products or herbs. You should check with your doctor before\n   proceeding with this approach. You must always be cautious about the\n   possibility of drug interactions when taking supplements or herbals in\n   addition to medications.\n\n   Other considerations include choosing loose-fitting, comfortable\n   clothing and regulating the temperature control to suit your\n   preference.\n\n   Vaginal dryness can be addressed through the use of lubricants prior\n   to sexual activity. There are many products available without\n   prescription to remedy this problem. Persistent vaginal itching should\n   be investigated to rule out the possibility of infection (see also the\n   section below on Sexuality).\n   \n                                OSTEOPOROSIS\n                      (Natural & Chemotherapy-Induced)\n\n   What is osteoporosis? \n\n   Osteoporosis or \"porous bones\" is a condition of decreased bone mass.\n   Bone is living tissue that continuously undergoes breakdown and\n   rebuilding (at a cellular level) as a normal body process. Peak bone\n   mass is usually reached by age 38. After that, bone begins to lose\n   mass as part of the aging process. As bone mass is lost, bones become\n   brittle. Men generally lose 20-30% of their bone mass over their\n   lifetime, and women generally lose 45-50% of their bone mass.\n   Decreased bone mass can lead to an increased risk of bone breakage and\n   disability.\n\n   Why is this important to me now, and what are the risk factors?\n\n   As a person receiving cancer treatment, you are at increased risk for\n   osteoporosis. Risk factors for osteoporosis include:\n\n   Early hormone deficiency (menopause)\n\n   Chronic malnutrition\n   \n   Smoking\n\n   Alcohol consumption\n  \n   Limited weight-bearing exercise\n\n   Family history\n\n   Ethnicity--more prevalent in Caucasian (white) and Asian women\n\n   Small body frame\n\n   Chemotherapy can interfere with your normal production of hormones due\n   to its effect on ovarian function. Reduction or failure of ovarian\n   function automatically places you at increased risk for osteoporosis.\n   It is important that you discuss prevention and treatment strategies\n   with your doctor or nurse.\n\n   Would I know if I had osteoporosis? Can I be tested for it?\n\n   Early changes in bone density are usually painless. Most people don't\n   know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone. That is why it is\n   important to know the risk factors and to learn what you can do to\n   prevent bone deterioration.\n\n   Testing can be done for osteoporosis. First, you should have a\n   thorough health history and physical exam to determine your risk\n   factors for osteoporosis. Then, your doctor will discuss or recommend\n   your having a bone mineral density test if you are considered to be at\n   high risk. It is a safe, painless and non-invasive test. This\n   establishes your baseline bone density and provides useful information\n   in determining the best course of action for you.\n\n   In North Carolina, bone mineral density (BMD) tests are available in\n   some pharmacies. The cost of measuring the BMD in the heel is\n   generally around $30, and this correlates well with the trabicular\n   (spine) bone. This test reveals very little about the cortical (hip)\n   bones, so you will not get the whole picture. However, the test will\n   give you a reasonable assessment and baseline information that you can\n   take to your doctor to see if further testing is needed. The test\n   takes about five minutes or less and is pain free. You can have this\n   test done without a referral from your doctor.\n\n   Can I help prevent osteoporosis from happening to me?\n\n   Yes. There are a number of prevention strategies that are recommended\n   to reduce your risk for osteoporosis:\n\n   Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet\n\n   Including Vitamin D and calcium in your diet\n\n   Avoiding animal protein, salt and caffeine\n\n   Quitting smoking and avoiding excessive alcohol intake\n\n   Taking medications that reduce the natural bone breakdown process\n\n   Increasing your weight-bearing exercise, such as walking or lifting\n   weights.\n\n   Again, your healthcare team should advise you in regard to these\n   strategies, but you should not hesitate to initiate this discussion\n   with them.\n   \n                                 SEXUALITY\n\n   Every woman's image of their body and sexuality is unique. No two\n   people have exactly the same response or feelings when they learn they\n   have breast cancer. If a mastectomy is performed, this can be\n   overwhelming and emotionally difficult for some women. For others, it\n   is a relief to have the cancer removed. Treatment for cancer, such as\n   chemotherapy, can cause physical changes that may interfere with a\n   woman's sexuality.\n\n   In addition, breasts are a part of many womens' sexual identity.\n   Breasts are symbolic of nurturing, sustaining new life and intimacy.\n   The loss of a breast can be threatening to body image and sense of\n   self.\n\n   If I have a mastectomy, will I be disfigured?\n\n   Mastectomies today are done to preserve muscle, so there is much less\n   disfigurement than there used to be.  It is very important that you\n   discuss this topic fully with your surgeons. If you are interested in\n   reconstruction, you may want to consider options regarding breast\n   reconstruction at the time of your initial surgery. If so, you should\n   be referred to a plastic surgeon for a full discussion of your\n   options. In some situations, reconstruction is not advised at the time\n   of your initial surgery, but can be done at a later date after all of\n   your cancer treatment has been completed. Reconstruction can also be\n   chosen years down the road.\n\n   What if I choose not to have reconstruction?\n\n   If you wish to use one, external breast prosthetics (breast forms) are\n   available to help minimize the visual alteration of losing a breast.\n   There are many different options available to you. You might want to\n   consider this, too, when deciding about surgery and potential\n   reconstruction options.  (Also see the section on Reconstruction in\n   After the Diagnosis in this directory).\n\n   Will my sex life be different after breast cancer?\n\n   Chemotherapy for breast cancer can sometime cause a woman to go into\n   premature, or early, menopause. This can be difficult for a woman\n   physically, emotionally and sexually. The symptoms of early menopause\n   are sometime more severe than those that occur with natural menopause.\n   These symptoms can include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and low\n   sexual desire, as well as depression, anxiety and increased\n   irritability. Other menopausal issues include increased risk of heart\n   disease and osteoporosis.\n\n   Are there solutions to the sexual problems I might face?\n\n   The good news is that there are solutions for these problems. Hot\n   flashes can be treated with specific drugs prescribed by a doctor.\n   Some women also have found Vitamin E or soy products to be helpful.\n\n   Vaginal dryness can be improved by the liberal use of a lubricant such\n   as Lubrin, K-Y Jelly, Ortho Personal Lubricant, Surgilube, Today\n   Personal Lubricant or Astroglide. Replens, a vaginal moisturizer, can\n   be used three times a week. Recent studies have found that both\n   Estrace, a estrogen cream used vaginally, or Estring, a vaginal ring\n   with slow release of estrogen, restore the vaginal tissues without\n   increasing estrogen in the rest of the body.  Ask your doctor about\n   these options.\n\n   Persistent, low sexual desire is sometimes treated with androgens. You\n   can have your hormone levels checked and discuss this option with a\n   doctor. Other ways of increasing desire are reading erotic literature\n   or watching erotic videos. Almost all women who were orgasmic before\n   cancer treatment can be so again although sometimes it takes\n   relearning and practice.\n\n   If needed, doctors can also prescribe therapies that address other\n   menopausal issues (depression, anxiety, irritability, increased risk\n   of heart disease and osteoporosis). Several new, improved therapies\n   are now available.\n\n   See the publications and organizations in Resources below for more\n   help with managing menopausal symptoms.\n\n   How will my spouse or lover feel about me after surgery?\n\n   It is very important that you discuss this with your partner. Open,\n   honest communication about your feelings and theirs is very beneficial\n   to your overall sense of well being and the intimacy you experience\n   before and after treatment. Your healthcare team may include a social\n   worker or psychologist who can specifically help you to address your\n   feelings and fears regarding sexuality and intimacy. Your acceptance\n   of your body changes will affect how others react to you.  It is\n   important for you to be open about your feelings to yourself and to\n   your spouse, lover or partner.\n\n   Always remember that who you are has nothing to do with your breasts\n   (although perhaps they may have played a part in your self-esteem or\n   sexual identity prior to your surgery).  You are special no matter\n   what the size of shape of your body, and you deserve to be in an open,\n   honest and loving relationship with someone who cares about you--and\n   accepts you--because of who you are in your heart, mind and soul.\n\n   I'm single and not in a relationship.   How and when do I tell someone\n   new in my life about my breast cancer and surgery?\n\n   This is not a question with any easy answers, but there are some\n   things you can consider when you find yourself in a new relationship:\n\n   First, have you reached your own personal level of acceptance of your\n   body and your experience with breast cancer?\n\n   Have you accepted the possible changes to your body which might later\n   be issues in a relationship, such as early menopause and inability to\n   bear children, or possibility of recurrence?\n\n   Are you comfortable enough with yourself and your experience to share\n   it with someone else?\n\n   Decide whether this new person is one who would be caring and\n   sensitive to your needs. Are you comfortable enough to open yourself\n   up and share it with this person? If not, then perhaps either the\n   timing is not right or the person is not the one for you.\n\n   Only you can decide whether you are ready to enter into a new\n   relationship with someone. And you alone are the only person who can\n   know whether you feel comfortable and \"safe enough\" in a new\n   relationship to share your feelings, your experience and your body.\n\n\n                                 RESOURCES\n\n                               Organizations\n\n   American Cancer Society, Inc.

First place receives 100 points, down to 1 point for 25^th\n   place.\n\n   Last year's (1998) winners were: (1^st) Michele Bartoli, (2^nd) Leon\n   Van Bon, (3^rd) Andrea Tafi.\n\n   Here are this year's (1999) events:\n\n                           Milan-San Remo, Italy\n   Distance: 183 mi (294km) When:Sat, March 20\n   Course: From Milan to San Remo on the Mediterranean sea. Contains two\n   major climbs - Cipressa (790ft) and Poggio (530ft) in the latter part\n   of the race. Poggio's descent is followed by a flat 3.3km to the\n   finish.\n   1998 Winner: Erik Zabel  1997 Winner: Erik Zabel\n\n                             Tour Of Flanders, Belgium\n         Distance: 172 mi (277km)             When: Sun, April 4\n    Course: From Bruges to Meerbeke, near Brussels. Contains five short\n      climbs, most noticeable are: hill #7 - Old Kwaremont; hill #10 -\n    Taaienberg; and hill #14 - Muur. The race finishes slightly uphill.\n        1998 Winner: Johan Museeuw        1997 Winner: Rolf Sorenson\n\n                             Paris-Roubaix, France\n        Distance: 166 mi (267km)             When: Sun, April 11\n    Course: From Compigne, an hour northeast of Paris to Roubaix, which\n       is between Lille and the border with Belgium. This famous race\n    contains 27 sections of cobblestone, totaling about 30 miles of the\n    latter half of the course. The section through the Wallers-Arenberd\n                    Forest is particularly treacherous.\n      1998 Winner: Franco Ballerini     1997 Winner: Frdric Guesdon\n\n                          Lige-Bastogne-Lige, Belgium\n        Distance: 165 mi (265.5km)           When: Sun, April 18\n    Course: The hilliest of the spring classics. 13 climbs, 11 of which\n   are in the latter half of the race. Major climbs are both Stockeu and\n    Haute Leve in the town of Stavelot - a mean combination, and a 20%\n     grade climb, La Redoute, just after Remouchamps. The race finishes\n          flat in Ans, a suburb of Lige, after a rough 1km climb.\n       1998 Winner: Michele Bartoli      1997 Winner: Michele Bartoli\n\n                       Amstel Gold Race, Netherlands\n                Distance: 160 mi (258km) When: Sun, April 24\n   Course: Start and finish in Maastricht, near the Belgian border.

        "articleBody": "December 31, 2004\n\n   There's No Place Like Home\n\n   My flight from Miami landed early into snowy Detroit, where it then\n   took over an hour to actually get to the gate and off the plane\n   because of the 10 inches of snow. My parents picked me up from the\n   airport and we made a mad dash for Taco Bell, where I finally\n   satisfied my unrelenting craving for 2 taco supremes and a nachos\n   supreme. I spent much of the last week bringing my house out of\n   hibernation, catching up with friends, and eating my favorite foods\n   that I have been deprived of since June.\n\n   And now, here I am, writing this last entry from the comfort of my own\n   home, in exactly the same spot as I was back in May designing this\n   blog and writing its first entries. My trip was exactly 200 days long\n   and in just 3 more days I will be rejoining the \"real world.\" Time\n   sure flies.\n\nDecember 21, 2004\n\n   Advenures in Transit\n\n   I left Uyuni on the night train to Oruro, which was supossed to leave\n   at midnight, but didn't leave until 1am. The only logical explanation\n   for the delay is that, it is Bolivia. I have found that 'It's\n   Bolivia,' is an excuse in itself for delays, cancellations, or\n   overbookings of transport of any form. The only noteworthy event from\n   the train ride was actually after it was over and everyone was\n   collecting their baggage. Apparantly a lady had died during the ride,\n   which was brought to my attention as the corpse was carried past me\n   and tossed into the back of a van, as if she were unclaimed luggage.\n   Sadly, the only people that seemed to think it was unusual were me and\n   the other backpackers that had taken the overnight train. All of the\n   locals seemed unphased by it. From Oruro, I only had a 3 hour bus ride\n   to get to La Paz, which had been overbooked, but luckily I was already\n   in my seat when someone came to claim it as theirs, showing a ticket\n   that was identical to mine. I didn't budge.\n\n   December 18, 2004\n\n   Pass the Salt Please\n\n   The Salar de Uyuni in southwestern Bolivia covers 12,000 square km,\n   and is the worlds largest salt flats. About 30,000 years ago, the salt\n   flats were covered by a lake called Lago Munchin. When the sea dried\n   up, it left the Salar de Uyuni, which contains about 10 billion tons\n   of salt. At its deepest point, the salt is about 8 meters deep. I\n   wanted to visit the salt flats when I was in Bolivia in October, but\n   didn't have time. So when my flight from Buenos Aires to Lima was\n   cancelled, I decided it was a sign that I should make my own way to\n   Bolivia and see them. I arrived in Uyuni after a 2 hour flight and\n   about 14 hours of bus rides and organized a three day, two night tour\n   of the Salt flats and some nearby lakes.\n\nDecember 14, 2004\n\n   From Seasickness to Altitude Sickness\n\n   Getting from Buenos Aires to Uyuni, Bolivia, my jumping off point for\n   the tour to the Bolivian Salt Flats was an adventure in itself. The\n   flight from Buenos Aires to Salta was uneventful, and I only stayed\n   one night there before leaving on a bus heading north to La Quiaca in\n   the morning. The bus to La Quiaca was about seven hours long and not\n   too bad of a journey, despite the sweltering heat on the bus, and my\n   need to use the bathroom for hours but being afraid that the bus would\n   leave without me if I went. For the first three hours, I sat next to a\n   12 year old girl named Cynthia who was hopping off in a little village\n   on the way to visit her four brothers. It was good to practice my\n   spanglish with her, and I taught her to count to ten in english. After\n   she got off the bus, I befriended an Argentinian named Jose Luis that\n   had spent six months in Mossuri studying geology and spoke English\n   very well. His destination was La Quiaca also, and when I told him I\n   was planning to cross the border into Bolivia and head to Tupiza, he\n   was kind enough to offer to escort me over the border and make sure I\n   find the correct bus to Tupiza (where I would then have to find\n   another bus to Uyuni). The random kindness of strangers is always\n   refreshing. I must make it a point to be nicer to strangers when I get\n   home.\n\nDecember 12, 2004\n\n   And For My Next Act...\n\n   So here I am in Buenos Aires. I spent about 75% of my first two days\n   here blogging about Antarctica. I also made a quick stop into the U.S.\n   Embassy to get more pages put into my passport, since it is full, and\n   I stopped into a travel agent to reconfirm my flight out of Buenos\n   Aires. When I got to the travel agency, I found out my ticket had been\n   cancelled, inexplicably. What the heck? I knew I was too lucky leaving\n   Ushuaia not having a kink in my flight plans like most others did. I\n   think it's a blessing in disguise though, because I really wanted to\n   see the Bolivian Salt Flats, which is sort of on the way to Lima\n   (where I need to catch my flight back to the States). Sooo... I'm\n   going to make my own way to Lima and hopefully stop into the salt\n   flats on the way! Yay!\n\nDecember 10, 2004\n\n   A Mostly Smooth Drake\n\n   After our last two landings, it was time to head back into the Drake\n   Passage, unfortunately. The way back was also mostly \"smooth,\"\n   although it did get pretty rough in the middle of the night on the\n   second night. At about 1 am, I woke up to everything not nailed down\n   on one side of the room flying over to the other side of the room,\n   including a ladder and a chair. The violent rocking only lasted for a\n   couple of hours, but all night, I was involuntarily moving in a sort\n   of elliptical motion, like my whole body was revolving around some\n   imaginary axes. I didn't really sleep that night, but at least I\n   didn't get sick.\n\n   Anyone for a Swim?\n\n   We had two more landings left before heading back across the Drake\n   Passage to Ushuaia. After the morning wake up call and breakfast, we\n   geared up for our landing on Deception Island. The \"deception\" of the\n   Island is that it is actually an active volcano, which last erupted in\n   1970. The island is shaped like a ring because of its collapsed cone.\n   We landed at Whalers Bay, where there are remains from the old whaling\n   station that closed in the 1930s. I walked up and down the sulphurous\n   smelling beach checking out the whale bones and some of the old\n   buildings. I also walked up to Neptunes window, which is a low point\n   in the crater rim, where there was a nice view of the beach below.\n\n   Continental Landings\n\n   The next day we made two more landings, both on the Peninsula itself.\n   After the excitement of the previous day, everything ran like\n   clockwork. Delphin took us over in the zodiac to the first landing at\n   Waterboat point, where two British researchers spent a year living in\n   a shelter made from an upturned whalers boat in 1921. There is not\n   much evidance left of the boat, its location is now covered in snow\n   and nesting penguins under the Chilean Flag. Also at this location is\n   the Presidente Gabriel Gonzalez Videla Staion, that is manned in the\n   summer only. When we arrived, the four chileans had arrived only a few\n   days prior and had just finished digging their summer home out of the\n   snow.\n\n   Petermann and Lemaire\n\n   Leaving Mikkelsen Harbor, we were already at a latitude of 63 degrees\n   south. Of course, part of being that far south at this time of the\n   year is that it doesn't really get dark. I woke up at about 3:30 am\n   friday morning to the crunching of ice against the ship. Looking out\n   through the porthole, it was light enough that it could have been mid\n   afternoon on a cloudy day. I went up to the bridge to see what was\n   going on, and found out we were still trying to continue south to get\n   to the Lemaire channel, but the ice was building up. The crew was\n   intently watching the ice. I stayed up there almost falling asleep on\n   my feet for about an hour or so, until I decided to go back to my\n   cabin and try to sleep. It was tough though, I kept getting up and\n   looking through the porthole to see what was happening.\n\n   LET US IN!!!\n\n   The next morning, thursday, we were supossed to have our first\n   landing, but when I woke up and looked out the window, it didn't seem\n   very promising. We were still cruising along the ice edge looking for\n   a way in to the channel. After breakfast, Laurie had a meeting in the\n   lounge to talk about our position and what we were planning to do,\n   which pretty much came down to \"try to find a way in.\" (map).The\n   previous day we had been all the way down by Anvers Island and had to\n   turn around after reaching the pack ice in the Bismark Strait. We\n   sailed overnight back along the ice edge and tried to get in between\n   Anvers Island and Brabant Island, but part way in had to turn around\n   again because of the ice. So by the morning, we were still heading\n   along the ice edge looking for a way into the channel."

        "articleBody": "4.4 Health of the environment\n\n   \n\nEutrophication\n\nConcentrations in Welsh rivers of the main plant nutrients (phosphate\n   and nitrate) are generally much lower than those found in the midlands\n   and south-east England. There are correspondingly fewer perceived\n   problems associated with eutrophication compared with lowland England.\n   However, nutrient enrichment arising from sewage inputs and\n   agriculture does cause water quality problems in all types of aquatic\n   environment, affecting drinking water supplies, conservation interests\n   and recreational uses.\n\nA number of water-supply reservoirs are regularly affected by\n   blue-green algal blooms notably Llandegfedd, Wentwood, Cefni and\n   Nant-y-Frith, with implications for water treatment and supply.\n   Conservation interests are being affected at a number of important\n   wetland sites on Anglesey, at Bosherston Lakes in south Pembrokeshire\n   and at Llangorse Lake near Brecon. Eutrophication is affecting the\n   survival of two endangered fish species: the gwyniad in Llyn Tegid and\n   the arctic charr in Llyn Padarn. Blooms of blue-green algae can\n   interfere with recreational activities at a number of waters,\n   including Llysyfran Reservoir and Eglwys Nunydd. Despite the\n   environmental safeguards to deal with the consequences of\n   eutrophication specified in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act, algal blooms\n   are likely to affect recreational uses and aesthetic enjoyment within\n   the impoundment.\n\nThe Wye below Hereford and the \n   Loughor below Garnswllt STW have been designated as sensitive areas\n   under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. In both stretches,\n   phosphate inputs from sewage works have been shown to promote plant\n   growth which may cause serious de-oxygenation during the night under\n   conditions of high temperature and low river flow. Resulting low\n   concentrations of dissolved oxygen have been implicated in fish\n   mortalities on the lower Loughor in 1984, 1990 and 1995. Besides these\n   designations, there are many smaller watercourses in lowland areas\n   which are affected by growths of algae. These effects appear to be\n   chiefly related to inputs of nutrients from agricultural sources and\n   may reduce the survival of salmonid eggs and fry in heavily affected\n   stretches.\n\nIn general, scientific understanding of the links between nutrient\n   inputs and eutrophication in estuarine and coastal waters is much less\n   advanced than for freshwaters. Nevertheless, eutrophication appears to\n   be connected with periodic low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in\n   the Loughor and Dee estuaries. The impoundment created by the Tawe\n   Barrage in Swansea is subject to blooms of marine algae, and the\n   impoundment has already been designated as a sensitive area.\n\nHistorical records\n   indicate that algal blooms in coastal waters have been a periodic\n   natural occurrence. However, the concentration of blooms of\n   Phaeocystis between Liverpool Bay and the Menai Strait in north Wales,\n   around Aberystwyth and in Carmarthen Bay suggest an influence of\n   enhanced nutrient inputs in these areas arising from sewage,\n   agricultural run-off and industrial discharges. Concentrations of\n   nutrients and algae in the Irish Sea have risen steadily since the\n   1960s, so this problem appears to be increasing. Foams and scums\n   arising from blooms are aesthetically unpleasant, can be mistaken for\n   sewage and give rise to numerous public complaints over bathing water\n   quality.\n\nBlooms of toxic marine algae are relatively rare around the Welsh\n   coast although blooms of the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium aureolum have\n   been linked to fish and shellfish mortalities in Swansea Bay in 1989\n   and St. Brides Bay, Pembrokeshire in 1994. Other blooms of potentially\n   toxic alga include the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense which has\n   been recorded in the upper part of Milford Haven since 1995, and a\n   bloom of Dinophysis was recorded within the Tawe impoundment in 1995.\n   The former can produce Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and the latter\n   Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, but no effects on human health have\n   been observed to date.\n\nSynthetic chemicals\n\nThe distribution of individual synthetic chemicals in the Welsh\n   environment reflects their physical and chemical properties, and the\n   way in which they are dispersed. The persistent substances are poorly\n   soluble in water but soluble in fat. They therefore attach to sediment\n   particles, accumulate in the fatty tissues of animals, and pose the\n   greatest risk to animals at the top of food chains. In freshwater\n   these are fish-or insect-eating aquatic birds and aquatic mammals,\n   such as otters, and in the marine environment seals, porpoises,\n   dolphins and seabirds are at greatest risk. Clearly humans are also at\n   potential risk from the consumption of contaminated wild animals. The\n   techniques for monitoring distribution and measuring the effect of\n   these chemicals are difficult and expensive. Consequently only the\n   apparent high priority chemicals have received attention so far, and\n   techniques are still being developed for many groups of synthetic\n   pollutants.\n\nPCBs\n\nPCBs have been found to be present in freshwater eel tissue at sites\n   throughout Wales, but highest concentrations were found in the lower\n   reaches of industrialised catchments in the south-east and north.\n   Aerial inputs derived from global sources may also be a significant\n   route for PCBs found in dipper eggs (an insectiverous riverine bird)\n   at remote rural sites.\n\nIn the marine environment, contamination is related to past industrial\n   production, use, disposal and subsequent transport with fine sediment.\n   Marine sediments areheavily contaminated close to river mouths and\n   docks in the Severn Estuary/Bristol channel, contaminated at offshore\n   sites in the Severn Estuary and Swansea Bay, and slightly contaminated\n   in the centre of the Bristol Channel. Although fish from Cardigan\n   Bay and the Severn Estuary do not appear to be seriously contaminated,\n   high concentrations have been found in marine mammals from these\n   locations. This appears to be evidence of high accumulation in\n   predators at a considerable distance from PCB sources.\n\nDioxins\n\nThe greatest risk of contamination by dioxins/furans is near potential\n   sources such as waste incinerators. The Welsh Office commissioned a\n   study of dioxins/furans and PCBs in the environment around the\n   high-temperature incineration plant of Rechem at Pontypool in 1991.\n   With the exception of a localised area within 500m of the plant,\n   measured concentrations of PCBs and dioxins/furans in the environment\n   provided little evidence of levels of contamination any different from\n   those encountered in similar areas elsewhere in the UK. The effects of\n   this plant should not give rise to undue concern, according to\n   accepted criteria and guidance on health effects for these compounds.\n\nPesticides\n\nOrganochlorine pesticides were used for a wide range of applications\n   in Wales, sheep dipping and wool preparation being the main rural use.\n   Use of dieldrin and DDT in the UK was banned in the late 1980s, but\n   significant residues of these pesticides remain in eels from\n   agriculture-intensive and industrialised catchments. In the marine\n   environment they are still found in the fatty tissues of marine\n   mammals, and an inshore Cardigan Bay sediment sample contained the\n   highest level of dieldrin contamination of all sites in a national\n   survey. Pentachlorophenol was synthesised in Wales and is still\n   found in the discharge from the manufacturing site, although\n   production ceased many years ago. Residues remain in sediments\n   surrounding the discharge, and a slight effect on the invertebrate\n   community there is evident. The biological impacts of organophosphate\n   and synthetic pyrethroids are covered in Section 4.2.\n\nPAHs\n\nPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that result from combustion of\n   fossil fuels and waste material are found widely in industrialised\n   areas, in road run-off and in marine sediments close to shorelines.\n   Many are moderately persistent in the environment, but are broken down\n   in fish and higher vertebrate animals. They can cause the same sorts\n   of cellular effects as PCBs and dioxins.\n\nOrganotin\n\nUse of tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paint on boats less than 25m in\n   length ceased in 1987, and the application and removal of such paints\n   on boats of 25m or more became subject to regulation in 1996. Evidence\n   of impact on the affected species (dog whelk) is limited to parts of\n   Milford Haven and Holyhead harbour, close to current sources of TBT on\n   large vessels. Organotin compounds have been used in other\n   applications and their well-documented endocrine disruptive effect may\n   require further assessment.\n\nRadioactivity\n\nSurveys in Wales show that the average radon concentration in Welsh\n   homes is 20 becquerels/cubic metre, equivalent to about half of the\n   total radioactive dose received by the population. Radon levels are\n   higher than this average in parts of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire,\n   Radnorshire, Anglesey and north-east Wales due to the underlying\n   geology. More extensive areas with high radon concentrations occur\n   elsewhere in the UK such as Cornwall and parts of north-east Scotland.\n   Raised levels of radon gas increase the risks of lung cancer and the\n   National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has advised that indoor\n   radon above an Action Level of 200 bequerels/cubic metre should be\n   reduced. It has been estimated that Wales has about 10,000 homes with\n   radon levels above this level.\n\nIn June 1998, the Welsh Office announced a targeted testing programme\n   for four areas at the highest risk from radon gas emitted by natural\n   sources. Householders in these areas can receive detectors from the\n   NRPB to monitor radon gas in their properties over a three-month\n   period. The need for measures to reduce levels will then be evaluated.\n   Grants to assist in this work may be available from local authorities.\n   New homes are protected through the building requirements in\n   high-radon areas.\n\nThe results of extensive monitoring of the effects of nuclear\n   facilities on levels of radiation in the environment are reported\n   annually by MAFF. This includes an assessment of the maximum exposure\n   to radiation to humans from each source. For terrestrial sources,\n   these assessments are generally based on concentrations in\n   agricultural produce local to the nuclear facility. For aquatic\n   foodstuffs, the assessment is based on concentrations in species\n   commonly harvested for human consumption. The calculation of the dose\n   received is based on consumers with the highest potential intake of\n   the food in question. The exposure from each of the nuclear\n   facilities in Wales was a small percentage of the maximum limit (1\n   millisievert) for members of the public from artificial sources of\n   radiation .\n\nMonitoring in 1998 of the impact of the discharges from Amersham in\n   Cardiff established that there were relatively high concentrations of\n   tritium in flounders (up to 50,000 bequerels/kilogram) caught near the\n   effluent discharge from the plant and also in sediments within the\n   Severn Estuary. Previously it had been assumed, in accordance with\n   other studies, that concentrations in fish would be similar to that of\n   ambient seawater. The finding that tritium could be bioaccumulated\n   required a reassessment of the radiation dose to the critical group of\n   fish consumers in Cardiff, and the 1997 figure of 3% has been revised\n   to 6%. This is still a small proportion of the dose limit but\n   nevertheless the unexpected bioaccumulation of tritium was of concern\n   and resulted in a requirement for tritium discharges to be reduced\n   significantly .\n\nA survey was undertaken in 1997 to determine the concentration of\n   technetium-99 in selected animals and plants around the Welsh coast.\n   Highest concentrations (1836 bequerels/kilogram) were found in brown\n   seaweed at sites closest to the Sellafield discharge along the north\n   Wales coast. Concentrations decreased southwards with lowest amounts\n   present at sites in the Bristol Channel.\n\nThe highest concentration found in periwinkles in the same survey was\n   152 bequerels/kilogram. This is not a high concentration in relation\n   to the risk to human health since consumption of 12 kilograms would\n   result in a radiation dose of 1 microsievert, which is only 0.1% of\n   the dose limit.\n\nAcid rain\n\nNitrogen now contributes 60% and sulphur 40%\n   of the total acidifying input from atmospheric deposition in the UK.\n   Some 40% of nitrogen deposition is oxidised nitrogen from the\n   combustion of fossil fuels, while 60% takes the form of ammonia,\n   mainly from agricultural sources within the country. Impacts by\n   acidification from nitrogen and sulphur emissions can be assessed by\n   the critical loads approach, which shows where deposition rates of\n   atmospheric pollution are high enough to cause environmental harm.\n   This demonstrates that acidity critical loads for soils and freshwater\n   systems are widely exceeded by the combination of nitrogen and sulphur\n   deposition,.\n\nCuts in sulphur emissions have reduced deposition in upland Wales from\n   3050 kg/ha/year in 1984 to 2030 kg/ha/year in 1995. Cuts in emissions\n   of oxidised nitrogen have also contributed to reducing the affected\n   area, but substantial further progress is needed. The effects of\n   reductions to date are apparent in declining sulphate concentrations\n   and slight reductions in the acidity of 77 streams surveyed in 1984\n   and 1995. However, these improvements have not yet led to biological\n   recovery ."

Let's see what happens if\n   and when the Ethiopians try to enter Mogadishu.\n   The other point is that this conflict isn't a straightforward\n   Islamist/Christian match up everyone seems to be assuming; or at least\n   that the religious aspect of the fight ties in with traditional Somali\n   irredentism from way, way back.\n\n     In Ethiopia the damage which [Ahmad] Gragn did has never been\n     forgotten,\" wrote Paul B.

I think that Ethiopia's main interest in this conflict lies in\n   keeping Somalia weak, rather than putting an end to Islamism in the\n   country. Meles Zenawi seems to be saying as much here:\n\n     Meles has said he does not intend to keep his forces in Somalia\n     long, perhaps only a few weeks. He has told visiting dignitaries\n     that his goal is to severely damage the Islamic movement's military\n     capabilities and allow both sides to return to peace talks on even\n     footing.\n\n   It looks like it might be Eritrea's turn to make a move, though they\n   may hold on to see whether more troops are sucked into the conflict.\n\nuniversal bereavement, an inspiring achievement\n\n   My conscience told me I should get this.

In the online petition, titled \"Out of\n     Cultural Collective Unconsciousness, Strengthen Chinese Cultural\n     Dominance\" and dated with traditional Chinese Era Calendar, PhD\n     students from China's most authoritative universities including\n     Beida, Tsinghua and People's University hope to \"wake up the\n     Chinese people to resist western cultural invasion\".\n\n   So what kind of western cultural imperialism are we talking about?\n\n     On the same day another report from the Henan Business News in\n     central China's Henan Province said a commercial chamber was\n     planning a nude running event on the evening of December 24, and\n     had received more than 1,700 applications to join in the activity.\n\n   Granite Studio takes up the theme:\n\n     Citing the increasing popularity of the holiday among the younger\n     generation, protest organizer Wang Dashan published an article, \"to\n     awaken the Chinese people and to resist Western cultural\n     expansion.\"\n\n     He argues that Christmas is a form of \"soft power\" that if left\n     unchecked will dilute traditional Chinese culture. Wang and his\n     associates fear that too many Chinese young people are simply\n     \"rejecting what is old and embracing what is new\" () and are\n     adopting an attitude of \"what is Chinese is inferior and what is\n     Western is excellent\" ().\n\n   I'm trying really, really hard not to say that Wang Dashan's Cantonese\n   name is Ba Hum-bug, but I'm clearly failing in this.\n\n   I was in China once in mid-January. The Christmas stuff was still up\n   there. A woman who ran a bar I drank at told me that she was going to\n   keep her decorations up till after lunar new year, the aim amongst a\n   lot of retailers in Beijing being to apparently establish a festive\n   season in the, well, seasonal sense, running from mid December till\n   February. This isn't cultural imperialism. It's a bunch of sharp,\n   commercially aware people in China taking a hard, cold look at the\n   thing and extracting as much utility from it as possible. Oh, yes:\n   these folks know what Christmas means.\n\ngovernment petition tomfoolery\n\n   Over here.\n\n     While we are aware of similar initiatives already in existence, the\n     Government does not currently have any plans to make monkeys\n     available to people with disabilities.\n\n   Damn them.via.\n\nDecember 21, 2006\n\nprezzies off the reaper\n\n   We've been having a few of them lately, what with Pinochet going, and\n   now the Turkmenbashi. Here's part of the official announcement,\n   reproduced for lovers of sycophantese:\n\n     \"The glorious years during which the Great Serdar ruled the Turkmen\n     people confirmed his heavenly faculty to foresee and his ability to\n     determine priorities. His unique abilities in the art of leading\n     the nation revealed his talent as a diplomat and a wise and humane\n     person,\" the statement says.\n\n     \"The objectives he set served the interests of the people, while\n     the large-scale projects that were implemented were in harmony with\n     the national spirit of the Turkmen people and were accepted by\n     every ethnic Turkmen and all other people living in Turkmenistan,\"\n     it says.\n\n   Via Nosemonkey, who has more to say. It's customary at this point to\n   offer some pious hopes on the subject of a transition to democracy, or\n   some such, but maybe the best you can do here is just keep your\n   fingers crossed for the Turkmen and hope the the successor's not a\n   total fruitcake. Nayazov renamed bread after his mother. Maybe the\n   next one will just mistake his wife for a hat or something.\n\nawesome understanding\n\n   I don't accept the overall premise of this George Packer article,\n   since it seems to embody a lot of the same hubris we've seen in\n   foreign policy over the past few years, except that this time we're\n   going to outwit them with our awesome understanding rather than\n   destroy them with our awesome firepower. Still, it's good on the\n   detail:\n\n     A war on terror suggests an undifferentiated enemy. Kilcullen\n     speaks of the need to \"disaggregate\" insurgencies: finding ways to\n     address local grievances in Pakistan's tribal areas or along the\n     Thai-Malay border so that they aren't mapped onto the ambitions of\n     the global jihad... as an example of disaggregation, Kilcullen\n     cited the Indonesian province of Aceh, where, after the 2004\n     tsunami, a radical Islamist organization tried to set up an office\n     and convert a local separatist movement to its ideological agenda.\n     Resentment toward the outsiders, combined with the swift\n     humanitarian action of American and Australian warships, helped to\n     prevent the Acehnese rebellion from becoming part of the global\n     jihad.\n\n   Relevant to which: Zawahiri attacks Hamas.\n\n     Zawahiri slammed Hamas for recognizing President Mahmoud Abbas and\n     running in elections last January.\n\n     \"Accepting the legitimacy of Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the\n     national authority, America's man in Palestine, and mandating the\n     PLO which recognizes Israel to negotiate with Israel is an abyss\n     which will ultimately lead to eliminating the jihad and recognizing\n     Israel,\" Zawahiri said.\n\n   So what do you do about this? Exploit the enmity between Hamas and\n   al-Qaeda or just write them off as an undifferentiated arc of\n   extremism? And how do you expect anyone to take you seriously when you\n   include Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States in your list of countries\n   that practice \"democracy and moderation?\"\n\n   And back to the Daily Star article:\n\n     Participation in the polls in turn led to \"respecting international\n     [UN] resolutions,\" which was followed by accepting to form a\n     government of national unity, and later by attempts to \"get them\n     [Hamas] out of government,\" he said.\n\n   It seems that the Z-man's got Blair's current Palestinian strategy\n   nailed. After it happens, he'll be there to say \"I told you so.\"\n\nunto a virgin\n\n   Topical, not to mention seasonal:\n\n     A virgin birth is expected this Christmas, though this particular\n     nativity scene will be set in a zoo instead of a stable.\n\n     That's because the virgin in question is Flora the Komodo dragon, a\n     giant lizard at Chester Zoo in England that has laid fertile eggs\n     despite never having had a mate.\n\n   Perhaps Flora was visited by the Holy Lizard. And is that David Icke,\n   bearing gifts?\n   \n  the enemy\n\n   Enemies all around I see...\n\n     A British soldier has been charged with passing secret information\n     linked to the military campaign in Afghanistan to Iran, The Times\n     has learnt. Corporal Daniel James, 44, appeared at City of\n     Westminster Magistrates' Court in London yesterday, charged under\n     Section 1 of the Official Secrets Act with communicating\n     information \"useful to the enemy\".\n\n     The case was considered so sensitive that after the charge had been\n     read out, reporters were told to leave and the remainder of the\n     hearing was held in camera...\n\n     ...However, The Times has learnt that the soldier was charged in\n     relation to the passing of confidential information about British\n     activities in Afghanistan to Iran, which shares a border with\n     western Afghanistan, and has a strategic interest and influence in\n     the region.\n\n   So far as I'm aware, the OSA has various provisions against revealing\n   any secrets at all, to anyone. And I know that you don't actually have\n   to be in a shooting war with another country to identify it as\n   belligerent. But what's the actual legal basis for a prosecution\n   identifying Iran as \"the enemy\"? Or is this an attempt to establish\n   one?\n\nDecember 20, 2006\n\noh, that's the reason\n\n   Anthony Selsdon tells us why US diplomacy has been so effective over\n   the past few years:\n\n     Insiders insist that only with the release of documents,\n     particularly the extraordinary videotaped conferences that take\n     place weekly between Bush and Blair, will the true nature of this\n     relationship be understood. These documents, they claim, will\n     reveal an intimate partnership, with Bush relying heavily on\n     Blair's evaluation of European and, indeed, world leaders and Blair\n     emerging as a core player in the internal politics of the\n     administration.\n\n   I take it there's a large amount of hype in this statement, but it's\n   hard to believe given America's recent track record in winning friends\n   and influencing people that this is a credible line of defense. On the\n   other hand:\n\n     Blair's advisers believe that further progress on Europe was made\n     almost impossible by his French and German counterparts, Jacques\n     Chirac and Gerhard Schrder. These relationships have not been a\n     success, and so Angela Merkel's defeat of Schrder raised spirits\n     in No 10. Some of Blair's defenders, however, whisper that fate's\n     cruellest blow was for his premiership to have coincided with the\n     presidency of George Bush. Others say the same thing about Gordon\n     Brown.\n\n   There's an almost gargantuan sense of thwarted entitlement in this; as\n   if the whole world should be organized around What Tony Wants.\n\nnoted animator's passing noted\n\n   I don't want to sound like some postmodern media tosser, at least not\n   without getting paid for it, but I can't let the passing of Joseph\n   Barbera go by without noting that the local nickname for the cops in\n   Manchester is the Dibble. I think of this as an example of the great\n   tradition working itself organically down through the common culture.\n\n   And while we're here let's ask a vital question. Who was your\n   favourite wacky racer?\n\n   UPDATE: UPDATE: Martin Rowson draws the line:\n\n     In his Guardian obituary only about seven lines are given over to\n     Barbera's post-Tom and Jerry career, despite the fact that it took\n     up most of his professional life and made him his millions. That\n     strikes me as fitting. Although everyone born in the last 60 years\n     might imagine that they have happy childhood memories of The\n     Flintstones, Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound or, God help us,\n     Scooby-Doo, the truth of the matter is that they're crap. Complete\n     and utter crap. Worse, they're shoddily made crap, after\n     Hanna-Barbera devised what they called \"limited animation\", more\n     than halving the number of drawings from 26 per second to 3000 for\n     five minutes, the better to fill the empty moments on TV between\n     the ads. And thus they effectively destroyed animation for at least\n     two generations, before it slowly began to claw its way back to\n     respectability in the mid-90s.\n\n   Well, yes and no. In terms of Tom and Jerry there's the post Fred\n   Quimby era, where there was a definite falling off in quality. And the\n   TV cartoons certainly looked pretty shoddy. But they weren't all crap\n   either. In the plus column there's Top Cat and Wacky Races, and in the\n   minus...well, all the rest really.\n\n   Curiously enough, when I came to read Clockwork Orange I was reminded\n   of the lavish ultraviolence of the early Tom and Jerry. And Top Cat is\n   a kind of kiddie version of Gangs of New York. Top Cat's gang were\n   called Fancy Fancy, Spook, Benny the Ball, The Brain, and Choo Choo,\n   which is reminiscent of this:\n\n     The Whyos were the most powerful downtown gang between the Civil\n     War and the 1890s...whose most pre-eminent figures included such\n     coloufrul names as Hoggy Walsh, Fig McGerald, Bull Hurley, Googy\n     Corcoran, Baboon Doyle, Red Rocks Farrell, Slops Connolly...\n\n   ...and so on, from Luc Sante's Low Life.\n\nDecember 19, 2006\n\nsome Chinese law enforcement\n\n   OK, in reference to the last entry, let's do some newsgathering.\n\n   Dissident lawyer Gao Zhisheng, probably best known for defending Falun\n   Gong members, was kidnapped in Beijing by Chinese security forces last\n   August. He is now detained on various charges pertaining to\n   \"subversion.\" Even before that happened his life was somewhat crowded:\n\n     I went out this early this morning to exercise in the park. Several\n     plainclothesmen were around me. Compared to before, the scale of\n     the surveillance has clearly gone up. On the way back home, several\n     plainclothesmen shadowed me closely. After breakfast, my wife took\n     my daughter to the place of the music tutor. As soon as they\n     stepped out, the plainclothesmen followed them. While my daughter\n     took lesson for one hour, the plainclothesmen waited idly outside.\n     Afterwards, they followed them home...\n\n     ... When we arrived at KFC, we ordered food and we sat down to eat.\n     A big plainclothesman even came right up and stood across my wife\n     not more than 1.8 meters away. The others also came up. From their\n     wooden expressions, it was clear that they have done this sort of\n     thing often enough. So we ate while they stared. When we were done,\n     we went home escorted by the cars front and back again.\n\n   Now he's out of the way, the cops have started on his daughter.\n\n     On Saturday, December 16, Little Gege went to the school for\n     remedial lessons. She rode to school on a bicycle by herself. As\n     usual, the Ministry of National Security police followed her on\n     four bicycles and seven Buick MPV's. At noon, Little Gege got out\n     of school. Her classmates were going to play tennins. Little Gege\n     knew that she could not go with them, but she walked with them to\n     the bus stop. Since the classmates have not eaten, Little Gege\n     bought them a bowl of fried noodles. At that moment, the Ministry\n     of National Security police told Little Gege that she cannot go\n     with her classmates. So she kicked the police officer's bicycle.\n     The police walked up to her and confronted her, whereupon Little\n     Gege threw the bowl of noodles at his face. Then three male and\n     three female police surrounded the 13-year-old girl and proceeded\n     to pummel her. A tall police man picked her up and threw her on the\n     ground. A police woman pulled her hair and cursed her. Her\n     classmates heard the the police woman cursed her: \"F**k! This\n     little bitch's hair is long!\" and then she stomped her foot on\n     Little Gege's thigh. Eventually the police officer hauled Little\n     Gege into the police car. During the process, Little Gege felt\n     someone pinching her back hard. All her classmates were stunned,\n     and nobody tried to stop the police. When the police officers took\n     Little Gege back to her home, they complained to her mother that\n     Little Gege had been uncooperative and refused to come home.\n\n   Ech. I don't normally try and get everyone to link to this kind of\n   stuff, but publicity has been known to help in cases like this.\n\nare you gathering news here?\n\n   The Beijing cops have produced a guidebook for their members on how to\n   talk to foreign journalists attending the Beijing Olympics, including\n   a number of sample conversations in English:\n\n   P(oliceman): Excuse me, sir. Stop, please.\n   F(oreign journalist): Why?\n   P: Are you gathering news here?\n   F: Yes.\n   P: About what?\n   F: About Falun Gong.\n   P: Show me your press card and your reporter's permit.\n   F: Here you are.\n   P: What news are you permitted to cover?\n   F: The Olympic Games.\n   P: Falun Gong has nothing to do with the Games.... You should only\n   cover the Games.\n   F: But I'm interested in Falun Gong.\n   P: It's beyond the limit of your coverage and illegal. As a foreign\n   reporter in China you should obey China law and do nothing against\n   your status.\n   F: Oh, I see. May I go now?\n   P: No. Come with us.\n\n the broken country theory of economics\n\n   Via Jim Henley, the combat economy:\n\n     It may sound unreal, given the daily images of carnage and chaos.\n     But for a certain plucky breed of businessmen, there's good money\n     to be made in Iraq. Consider Iraqna, the leading mobile-phone\n     company. For sure, its quarterly reports seldom make for dull\n     reading. Despite employees kidnapped, cell-phone towers bombed,\n     storefronts shot up and a huge security budget--up to four guards\n     for each employee--the company posted revenues of $333 million in\n     2005. This year, it's on track to take in $520 million. The U.S.\n     State Department reports that there are now 7.1 million\n     mobile-phone subscribers in Iraq, up from just 1.4 million two\n     years ago. Says Wael Ziada, an analyst in Cairo who tracks Iraqna:\n     \"There will always be pockets of money and wealth, no matter how\n     bad the situation gets.\"\n\n   Well, yes: people can afford IED triggers, and handy devices to warn\n   the folks next door that the militia/cops/US army has rolled into the\n   neighbourhood and it's time to rally the locals. And how else will you\n   hear about the ransom demand? The \"rebuilding the stuff that's been\n   blown up\" industry is also doing well, as is the demand for new\n   premises for the people who've been ethnically cleansed. Thanks to the\n   wisdom of its open borders policy imports are booming as well. Nothing\n   to do with the fact that domestic production is somewhat hampered by\n   endemic civil strife.\n\n   There's something very creepy about taking the transaction costs of\n   civil war, separating them from their origins and presenting the\n   result as good news. How about including the per diems of the folks\n   who plant IED's and the wages paid to militia members?\n\n December 18, 2006\n\nthere's no I in menswear\n\n   In it's own small way, this is perfect:\n\n     England's struggling rugby players are to appear in a World Cup\n     warm-up match against France in August without their famous white\n     shirts.\n\n     Instead, the team will sport a new \"away\" strip whose colour\n     Twickenham is refusing to reveal.\n\n     The move, which takes a leaf out of football's book, is part of a\n     drive to lift struggling merchandise sales, depressed by the team's\n     bad results.\n\n   Here, in the year of our Dawk 2006, is exactly how any British\n   institution responds to failure.\n\n   Never mind. I bet those la-di-dah Frenchies are already running up the\n   white flag at the thought of our world-beating mauve and taupe\n   combination bearing down on them.\n\nDecember 16, 2006\n\namid laughter and merriment\n\n   It's an internetty old world. Explananda Chris in New York finds an\n   article in a Surrey paper about a pigeon cull. It attracts one of the\n   best comment threads I've seen in ages:\n\n     I think the correct solution would be to hack the wings off as many\n     pigeons as possible before joining them together to create one\n     large wing. This could be wafted at the pigeons by any member of\n     the townsfolk when numbers got too high. Children could also\n     shelter under it at times of heavy rain or possibly loud thunder.\n\n   It gets better. In fact, it makes me want to sing...\n\n   So if Sunday you're free, why don't you come with me,\n   And we'll poison the pigeons in the park.\n   And maybe we'll do in a squirrel or two,\n   While we're poisoning pigeons in the park.\n\n   We'll murder them all amid laughter and merriment,\n   Except for the few we take home to experiment.\n\n   all ifs, no busts\n\n   In his examination of the recent unpleasantness re the Serious Fraud\n   Office and Saudi Arabia, Martin Kettle finds much to criticize in the\n   response of the public. Quelle fucking surprise.\n\n     Everybody's ordinary life is littered with compromises,\n     inconsistent behaviour and morally questionable decisions. It's far\n     easier to say what you are against than what you are for. Yet we\n     beat up on politicians as though expecting them to inhabit a\n     different moral universe. It's a pathetic and very British habit.\n     It is worth stopping to ask why we are so unrealistic and so wrong.\n     The real wonder is that politicians manage to remain as honest and\n     sensible as most of them do. It all says at least as much about us\n     as it does about them.\n\n   No, you crawling twat; we beat them up because we expect them to\n   inhabit the same moral universe as the rest of us; the one where\n   allegations of fraud are not excused on the grounds of political\n   inconvenience. Or \"no ifs, no buts\" is just for the little people,\n   right? That and the other 3000 ways in which the government have\n   thought it appropriate to improve our collective behaviour by means of\n   legislation.\n\n   What makes Kettle's pusillanimity even more galling is that any\n   charges would likely have been brought under legislation that the\n   government introduced itself in 2002. They're not just given a pass on\n   obeying rules against fraud everyone else is subject to, they're not\n   liable to full investigation under laws they make themselves.\n\n December 15, 2006\n\nthink of danger\n\n   Remember that poll on the BBC a year or so back which found that Marx\n   was the top bloke philosopher of all time or some such? It's found its\n   way to China, and an instructional DVD for party cadres:\n\n     THE 70 million members of the Chinese Communist Party have all been\n     watching a series of eight DVDs - not Yes, Minister, but Think of\n     Danger While Living in Safety: The Lessons From the Collapse of the\n     Soviet Union Communist Party...\n\n     ...The programs place most of the blame on Mikhail Gorbachev for\n     \"the extinction of the party, which must mean the extinction of the\n     country\" after 74 years in power. By extension, the same equation\n     may thus be applied to China: the end of the party's rule - 57\n     years so far - will mean the fragmentation and collapse of the\n     country.\n\n     The party presentation says: \"Collaborating with nationalists, the\n     so-called democrats within the party sped its split and that of the\n     Soviet Union encouraged by concepts advocated by Gorbachev,\n     including democratisation, openness and diversity of public\n     opinion.\"\n\n     The \"disastrous results\" of the ensuing \"shock therapy prescribed\n     by the Americans\" included a 52 per cent collapse of economic\n     output over a decade, 5000 per cent inflation, and average life\n     expectancy cut by four years.\n\n     The programs cite a survey by the BBC - whose website is barred in\n     China - that made Karl Marx the leading thinker of the last\n     millennium, followed by Albert Einstein. \"This shows that many\n     people believe we still need Marx, as natural science needs\n     Einstein's theories.\"\n\n   This was strictly not for consumption by the general public in China.\n   It is, however, compulsory viewing for cadres, who have to turn in a\n   report on what they've seen (this is fairly common as a means of\n   enforcing party discipline in China, with the result that there's\n   quite a thriving market in faked reports).\n   The Chinese public, meanwhile, has been getting an educational TV\n   series of its own: The Rise of the Great Nations.\n\n     Its stentorian narrator and epic soundtrack present the emergence\n     of the nine countries, from Portugal in the 15th century to the\n     United States in the 20th, and cites numerous achievements worthy\n     of emulation: Spain had a risk-taking queen; Britain's nimble navy\n     secured vital commodities overseas; the United States regulated\n     markets and fought for national unity.\n\n     The documentary also emphasizes historical themes that coincide\n     with policies Chinese leaders promote at home. Social stability,\n     industrial investment, peaceful foreign relations and national\n     unity are presented as more vital than, say, military strength,\n     political liberalization or the rule of law. In the 90 minutes\n     devoted to examining the rise of the United States, Lincoln is\n     accorded a prominent part for his efforts to \"preserve national\n     unity\" during the Civil War. China has made reunification with\n     Taiwan a top national priority.\n\n   So it's Marx for the bosses, Lincoln for the masses. The interesting\n   thing is that the world's last great leviathan state seems to be\n   promoting a remarkably whiggish view of history: peace, trade,\n   development and measured progress towards social, economic and\n   political openness ballasted by the steady, sure, accretion of wealth\n   and power. It could have been something by Braudel.\n\n   Sun Bin argues here that this is basically the official line of the\n   government, and the aim is partly to curb popular nationalism by\n   picking and choosing bits and pieces from the Western and Japanese\n   experience that make countries strong and sustainable.\n\n   On the face of it this doesn't make a good fit with the message the\n   cadres are getting. But then it's horses for courses really. The TV\n   series is meant to promote acceptance by the public that they're part\n   of a kind of developmental matrix under the guidance of a wise, open\n   and forward looking leadership, while the cadre DVD is meant to\n   promote discipline within the party. It's significant here that the\n   Chinese government is relaxed enough about public opinion to permit a\n   favourable discussion of the Glorious Revolution and the framing of\n   the US constitution but nervous enough about the state of the\n   Communist Party to insist on a Leninist model of discipline. It\n   indicates a belief that the main threat to CPC rule comes from within\n   the Party rather than from the public.\n\ninterested parties\n\n   Says the Attorney General:\n\n     \"It has been necessary to balance the need to maintain the rule of\n     law against the wider public interest. No weight has been given to\n     commercial interests or to the national economic interest.\n\n   And so ends the Serious Fraud Office's attempt to investigate the al\n   Yamamah deal. People seem inclined to lift an eyebrow at this,\n   especially since the campaign against the investigation was based on\n   apparent Saudi threats to pull out of the Eurofighter deal.\n\n   But let's take it seriously for a minute. What \"threats to national\n   security\" were caused by the SFO being \"on the brink of accessing key\n   Swiss bank accounts\"?\n\n     The prime minister and the foreign and defence secretaries have\n     expressed the clear view that continuation of the investigation\n     would cause serious damage to UK/Saudi security, intelligence and\n     diplomatic cooperation, which is likely to have seriously negative\n     consequences for the UK public interest in terms of both national\n     security and our highest priority foreign policy objectives in the\n     Middle East.\"\n\n   So, in this ruthless war of ideas against Islamic fundamentalism,\n   we're more dependent than ever on the goodwill of the Wahhabi state.\n   This seems to tie in to Juan Cole's contention of an emerging\n   US/UK/Saudi/Israeli front in the Middle East."

His big\n   question, is his team strong enough to carry Mayo for 3 weeks? Can his\n   team do well enough in the team time trial? I've heard this year there\n   was a rule change that limits the time loss in the team time trial to\n   something like 2 and a half minutes.\n   Tyler Hamilton came in 2nd in Dauphine Libere, including beating Lance\n   up the mountain time trial (35 seconds back of Mayo). He also won a 5\n   stage race in Switzerland earlier this year (I believe it's called the\n   Tour de Romandie).\n   Ullrich did not have a great performance in the Tour of Germany, but\n   if memory serves me right, he did win the Tour of Switzerland.\n   Another challenger is Lance's former domestique...Roberto Heras. Heras\n   is riding for what used to be known as Team ONCE, and is expected to\n   be the team leader. There is absolutely no doubt that Heras can climb\n   with the best of them. His team is also fairly good, so I doubt the\n   team time trial will be a problem.\n   Lance's coach says that the time trial up L'Alpe D'Huez is not the\n   most important stage. It's an important stage, but the most important.\n   Apparently the next day is going to be brutal. Lance's coach says it\n   could well be a 7 hour stage with several brutal climbs.\n   Honestly, I do wonder if Lance can win this year. I think he's had\n   more distractions this year than in years past...what with Sheryl\n   Crowe hanging around all the time, all the commercial shoots, magazine\n   cover shoots, getting a new primary sponsor, etc. I wonder if he's\n   done enough training this year.\n   My sincere hope: 2 Americans on the podium this year...Hamilton and\n   Armstrong.\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   jtwcornell91\n   06-29-2004, 09:15 AM\n   Originally posted by Murray\n   Speak English you unmitigated cheese eater.:p\n   Shouldn't it be \"... du Tour de France\"?\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   Ralph Baer\n   06-29-2004, 09:31 AM\n   Originally posted by jtwcornell91\n   Shouldn't it be \"... du Tour de France\"?

Still, the three best teams this year\n   should be Postal, Hamilton's Phonak team, and T-Mobile. Phonak has\n   looked really strong this pre-season, and they should contend for the\n   team time trial stage. The tour organizers put a 2min limit on the TTT\n   loss for this years tour, so that will help riders like Mayo and\n   Heras. Heras also has another former USPS teammate on his roster,\n   Christian Vande Velde, which will definitely help him in the smaller\n   mountains and the TTT.\n   The Dauphine results were a little skewed because Armstrong wanted to\n   take it easier than the last few years (he won it in 02 and 03)\n   because last year he crashed during one of the stages and was\n   supposedly still in pain from that during the start of the Tour.\n   Apparently he got a time check during the Mont Ventoux TT and saw that\n   Mayo and Hamilton were already flying, so he took it easier for the\n   remainder of the climb. The Alpe d'Huez TT in this years Tour is going\n   to be amazing to watch, it will definitely be alot closer than the\n   Dauphine TT. It is probably the stage I'm most looking forward to\n   seeing.\n   The day after that, like nanookfan said, will be killer. Long, with\n   two or maybe three (I don't remember) HC climbs ending with a mountain\n   top finish on the HC climb Plateau d'Beille. That has the possibility\n   of being an epic stage, especially with the mountain TT the day before\n   and some riders still spent from that.\n   I think that this years Tour has the possibility of being one of the\n   best in many years, and my guess is that the top four will be:\n   Armstrong, Hamilton, Mayo, and Ullrich, in no particular order. :)\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   brianvf\n   06-29-2004, 12:37 PM\n   It was also disappointing to see that David Millar, one of the better\n   TT today was banned from the Tour due to allegedly confessing to\n   doping.

Strange that this new TTT rule goes into effect the year that\n   he is trying to win his 6th. :rolleyes:\n   An interesting article on VeloNews.com was talking about how this\n   would have changed last years overall if these new rules would have\n   been in place:\n   A major change this year is that there will be a limit on the time\n   lost by any team (and consequently by each rider who arrives with the\n   first man to finish in the team) in the team time trial. The riders on\n   the winning team (except for those who are dropped by their team) will\n   all have their actual finish time added to GC, but there will be a\n   maximum loss of 20 seconds for the second team, 30 seconds for the\n   third, then 10-second gaps to 13th place (a 2:20 maximum loss), and\n   then five-second gaps down to 2:50 for the 21st (and last) team.\n   In 2003, instead of the result being:\n   1. U.S. Postal\n   2. ONCE, at 0:30\n   3. Bianchi, at 0:43\n   It would have been:\n   1. U.S. Postal\n   2. ONCE, at 0:20\n   3. Bianchi, at 0:30.\n   Also, 18th-placed Euskaltel-Euskadi, instead of losing 3:22, would\n   have lost only 2:35. If the new system had been in place last year,\n   Iban Mayo would have taken over the yellow jersey at L'Alpe d'Huez,\n   not Lance Armstrong; and Alex Vinokourov would have displaced\n   Armstrong as the race leader at Loudenvielle on stage 14.\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   brianvf\n   07-02-2004, 03:44 PM\n   Who does everyone think will win tomorrow's prologue and take over the\n   yellow?\n   McGee, Armstrong, Ullrich, Hamilton??\n   The course, being flat and very short (6 km), favors a strong,\n   powerful rider such as Ullrich.

They showed coverage of a\n   press conference with Lance from yesterday where he was fielding\n   questions about the book allegations.

It was pretty sweet. :)\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   nanookfan\n   07-02-2004, 10:18 PM\n   I'm not sure Lance would want the yellow jersey this early in the\n   tour. He has said in the past it is hard to defend the yellow jersey,\n   and defending it from the very start of the race is hard on the team.\n   If I remember correctly, Lance finished 7th in last year's Prologue,\n   so I wouldn't be too shocked if he wasn't in yellow after tomorrow.\n   After watching \"The Lance Chronicles\" yesterday, and the OLN tour\n   preview, it seems a lot of folks are thinking Lance is going to win\n   this thing. I must confess, I don't think he's going to, but during\n   the episode of \"The Lance Chronicles\" that I saw (when he was talking\n   about the Dauphine Libre), he seemed confident even though Mayo beat\n   him by 2 minutes in the time trial. He said \"Two minutes is a lot\" but\n   he had this goofy grin on his face as if to say \"I know something you\n   don't know.\" Could he have been sandbagging in the Dauphine?\n   Interestingly enough, Phil Liggett, Paul Sherwen, and Bob Roll (the\n   OLN commentating crew) all are predicting Lance to win the tour.\n   I don't know a lot about the sport, but I'll make a bold (all be it\n   wild) guess at the Prologue result. I'll guess Tyler Hamilton. He's a\n   good time trialer, and he's hungry. I think a yellow jersey would mean\n   the world to him. Perhaps tomorrow will be his day.\n     _________________________________________________________________\n\n   rufus\n   07-02-2004, 10:53 PM\n   not knowing who all is riding for all the teams, i'll go with mcgee.\n     _________________________________________________________________"

But if these\n   'affairs' are unconsummated, are we still being unfaithful? Joanna\n   Briscoe on a modern dilemma\n   Saturday June 18, 2005\n   The Guardian\n   Infidelity is defined purely by sex - or at least we think it is. One\n   drunken shag with someone whose name you've forgotten and you're\n   unfaithful; an unconsummated 20-year passion nurtured in secret and\n   you're a model of monogamy. But outside sex, there is an arena of\n   messy feelings for which we don't quite have a name - covert\n   relationships that involve secrecy and guilt.\n\n   We are all emotionally unfaithful. Even the most fiercely devoted mind\n   will occasionally, momentarily, wander, even if the body has little\n   intention of following. These days it is much easier to\n   compartmentalise aspects of our lives and, if we want, act on those\n   impulses. Aided by a culture of long working hours, isolated freelance\n   employment, almost universal access to ever-developing modes of\n   communication, there is a whole new network of flirtation, a\n   soundless, secret exchange of personal intimacies.\n\n   Suzannah, 34, the art director of a large design company, has watched\n   office flirtations develop over the past decade. \"It used to be a\n   covert squeeze by the photocopier or a quick illicit drink,\" she says.\n   \"Now, for example, there are two people in my company I know either\n   fancy each other or are sleeping together, and yet I never even catch\n   them looking at each other. All they do is email each other all day,\n   and do very little work. They have this huge, ongoing opportunity.\n\n   \"But then, through my work, I've got a friend with whom I have a big\n   conversational thing - he's my closest friend and there's an area of\n   life that he fills that my boyfriend doesn't, and so there's an\n   intimacy to that. I do question myself about this; I have to\n   acknowledge that my boyfriend wouldn't like it at all. The interesting\n   question is, where do we draw the line? In a way, it's infidelity when\n   you feel excited by the situation, when you feel unfaithful.\"\n\n   Lizzie, a caterer in her 30s with two children, counts herself as\n   \"very happily married, and I definitely wouldn't want to have an\n   affair, but life can be a bit humdrum. I always saw one of the fathers\n   at my daughter's school, and I knew he was interested in me, and that\n   excited me. I sat on it and thought, 'If it doesn't have to be\n   physical, why not?' I can't be very friendly with him openly, so we\n   had to find other ways of connecting. I did fancy him, but we've had\n   one talk about sex and both said, no, we can't, that's not going to be\n   part of it. The connection is something else; the secrecy in itself\n   lends a flavour to it.\n\n   \"So we text a lot, and talk covertly in public places. We email, and\n   occasionally meet for a drink. I do feel guilty about it, but it makes\n   me feel good, makes me feel I'm still eligible, still out there. It's\n   been something I've been able to keep separate, my own little secret.\n   Two of my friends know - and I only told them because they hinted that\n   they were in comparable situations. I want to own something not\n   harmful that's good for me. It did distract from my marriage a bit, to\n   be honest - a couple of nights I slept in the spare room, because the\n   text alert kept going and I thought, this is ridiculous. I don't think\n   it's morally OK, and I've pulled myself back from it, as otherwise it\n   would be all-consuming. I now think, my marriage is my marriage; this\n   is something extracurricular. I personally feel the ultimate\n   connection is sex, and I worry that if I did, it would be\n   disappointing and there would be nothing left - and I wouldn't do that\n   to my husband. But there's definitely something edgy and covert and\n   beyond the realms of what's acceptable.\"\n\n   After a certain age, an almost universal desire to settle down with\n   the right person takes hold. Plato's image of lost souls storming\n   about free-range until they slot together with their other halves\n   remains powerful, even in an over-sexualised era where we obsess about\n   adulterous celebrities. We still want to find The One. But, at the\n   same time, The One may not be enough. We believe we shouldn't have to\n   adhere to the constraints of our parents' putative lifelong mating. We\n   want it all, and believe we're entitled to it all. We end up combining\n   the best monogamous intentions with a whiff of rebellion against that\n   very state. Pure monogamy is not quite in tune with our supposedly\n   swinging, secular society.\n\n   David Miller is the founder of Loving Links, an extra-marital dating\n   service for \"thoughtful, attached men and women looking for romance\".\n   \"Adults now don't want to grow up,\" he says. \"We're told that we\n   should be having this, this and this, and we feel hard done by if we\n   don't. It's also the case for the baby-boomer generation: we're all\n   Peter Pans, and no one's yet sent us a letter saying we have to stop\n   having fun and sex.\"\n\n   There is a compulsion for the attached to seek romantic, if not\n   fleshy, liaisons as a licensed way to have something on the side.\n   Websites such as Friends Reunited involve a sizable chunk of the\n   population in one big adult sleepover, texting and emailing anyone\n   they like or fancy the sound of. This is justified as mental relief, a\n   reward for juggling partners with long working hours and last-minute\n   children. And for living so unprecedentedly long.\n\n   Robin, an advertising executive who has been sexually faithful\n   throughout his nine-year marriage, maintains ongoing romantic\n   fantasies. \"I think guys do all the time,\" he says. \"There's this\n   notion that women like romance and men like raw sex, and I think\n   that's not necessarily the case. People talk about sex addiction, but\n   I think sex addiction is a kind of romance addiction. It's part of\n   male desire - not a priapic need, but a need to be validated and\n   adored and made to feel whole by someone's reciprocal gaze. It's\n   people who come into your life on a regular basis - you build up a\n   little bit of a crush on them, and the next thing you know, you can't\n   quite look them in the eye and you've got a fantasy about them. I go\n   to Pilates a couple of times a week, and there's got to be someone\n   I've got a crush on at Pilates, someone my imagination lands on. In\n   the class, in its wordlessness, there's something relatively intimate\n   about it. There's a girl who's got a tattoo on her shoulder, she's got\n   a good shape and is nice and probably in her mid-30s, and in another\n   life I could see myself with her. I kind of identify with her. It's\n   more a romantic thing than a lust thing, but with an element of lust.\n\n   \"I'm very happy in my marriage, but if I don't have somebody I feel\n   romantically towards outside it, then I feel there's something wrong\n   with my life. I see it as perfectly reasonable, not a problem, because\n   I think there's an absolute moral distinction between shagging someone\n   else and having fantasies about someone else. It casts a spell on your\n   boring daily life.\"\n\n   I wanted to write about slow-burning emotional infidelity in my new\n   novel, because profound longing is more powerful than swiftly\n   gratified lust. A frisson of mutual recognition can develop into a\n   fixation in which both parties are stroking each other's mind, an\n   exchange charged with suppressed sexual desire. Close and frequent\n   mental interaction can be intensely erotic. It is astonishing how\n   quickly even the most monogamous can turn into tumescent fools,\n   deleting messages, fantasising about torrid futures with people they\n   barely know. The straitjacket of no-sex-allowed becomes an addiction\n   in itself. \"Having a partner who's emotionally unfaithful is maybe\n   more hurtful than one who's physically unfaithful,\" says Miller. Paula\n   Hall, a relationships therapist at Relate, thinks of infidelity as a\n   breach of trust. \"It's when you're sharing emotional stuff with other\n   people that you should be sharing with your partner.\"\n\n   According to a study last year by Dr Monica Whitty of Queen's\n   University Belfast, online emotional involvement can have as much\n   impact on an existing relationship as sexual infidelity. In her study\n   of 234 participants, who evaluated hypothetical online situations,\n   women were found to be more likely than men to view emotional\n   infidelity as cheating, and also more likely to see online infidelity\n   as harmful to a real-life relationship; however, others described the\n   interaction as \"just a friendship\" and would not classify it as\n   infidelity \"as there was no physical sex taking place\".\n\n   The online interactions studied ranged from mild flirting to cybersex,\n   and Whitty found that people's definitions of fidelity varied wildly.\n   \"The new technology and opportunities for infidelity are evolving\n   together. Cyberspace is a safe place to flirt. With online infidelity,\n   people see a fuzzy boundary between reality and fantasy. Our social\n   scripts about what is acceptable behaviour online are not as clear-cut\n   as they are offline, and there's more opportunity for betrayal now\n   that we've got more people to choose from online. People work less on\n   their own relationship; they tend to look elsewhere. Increasing\n   numbers of people are now going to therapy because of online betrayal.\n\n   \"The results of this study show that couples need to be clear what the\n   rules are when it comes to online cheating,\" says Whitty. \"Emotional\n   involvement, even without physical consummation, can be just as\n   damaging to a relationship.\" Hall agrees: \"Generally, research says\n   that there is more personal disclosure online than in a face-to-face\n   situation.\"\n\n   One woman I know in her 20s regularly emails strangers, going out on\n   drinking dates as a relief from the stresses of her relationship. Many\n   of her friends take a similar approach to their romantic lives. We may\n   be approaching an era in which heated romantic or sexual online\n   relationships will be deemed acceptable, just as men have\n   traditionally used porn while some partners turn a blind eye. The\n   repressed British psyche is well suited to a form of communication at\n   once intimate and detached. In news reports of the misadventures of\n   David Beckham, the provocative texts he sent Rebecca Loos were given\n   greater prominence than details of any alleged sex, the most secret\n   flirtation unravelling in all its ungrammatical glory.\n\n   Cate, a lecturer who has lived with her girlfriend for four years,\n   recently emerged from an obsessive but non-physical relationship with\n   another woman. \"What was so dangerous,\" she says, \"is that we seemed\n   to have an incredible meeting of minds. The more tangly and intricate\n   the conversations we had, the more it seemed that we had to keep\n   having them, that no one else thought like this. It's only now I\n   realise that, because it was almost all through letters, emails and\n   phone calls, I could ignore the fact that I didn't even physically\n   fancy her, though I'd persuaded myself I did. It could remain an\n   affair that was about to happen, which was incredibly exciting.\n\n   \"I'd sit at my desk rigid with anticipation for the bing of my email;\n   there was nothing like the thrill of an enormous, involved email from\n   her. It was like a speeded-up 18th-century romance - we were courting\n   while pretending not to, and the speed made it all more exciting and\n   feverish. Because it almost all took place at my desk, it was very\n   easy to pigeonhole: it was a marvellous, stimulating life of the mind\n   with nothing to do with either the sex or the arguments I was having\n   with my girlfriend. I didn't really feel guilty: it felt like this\n   discovery of a soulmate that should be encouraged, and nothing to\n   worry my girlfriend about. Even as it got more romantic - and it went\n   on for nearly two years; it consumed me - there was a safety belt:\n   nothing had actually happened.\"\n\n   More partnerships are now formed through the workplace than through\n   social life. Most adults spend more waking hours with colleagues than\n   with their partners, making meaningful, exciting and even intimate\n   workplace interactions inevitable. The mind is a sex organ, especially\n   for women, a fact that is overlooked in a body-fixated and\n   anti-intellectual era. In the workplace and by email, inventive brains\n   thrive.\n\n   Hall says this transformation of the workplace into one big\n   touchy-feely melting pot of sensibilities has significant consequences\n   at home. \"In terms of work, we all talk more openly: it's horribly\n   American, but we're getting more and more into 'sharing' ourselves.\n   The ethos of the workplace has changed a lot, too - there's more\n   emphasis on self-awareness, on emotional intelligence and literacy, on\n   teamwork, all things that are about building a community in the\n   workplace. Increasingly, it's the right place to share more personal\n   stuff. And then it can get dangerous.\" The office can be a sexy place.\n\n   Carey, an events organiser, has been in a relationship for eight years\n   but has formed a strong emotional relationship with someone at work.\n   Her friends are similarly distracted. \"I've got a small group of\n   friends. We've known each other for ever and we're all married or with\n   someone. In the past few years, we've begun talking in a really\n   excited, conspiratorial way about who we've got a thing for on the\n   side. It reminds me of when we were in our early 20s. We've got\n   children, we're older, but there's this wonderful excitement at having\n   a mental crush, a fascination, a thing going on with someone you hope\n   won't lead to anything. It's boring talking about your marriage, and\n   somehow too revealing - you can't talk about married sex because it's\n   too intimate. We talk about other people instead.\"\n\n   Some would argue that emotional infidelity can actually help a primary\n   relationship, but Hall disagrees: \"Just because chocolate makes you\n   feel good, it doesn't make you healthy. There's a tendency to say,\n   'I'm getting my emotional needs met elsewhere, which cuts down my\n   frustration with my partner.' Men have used that excuse for years to\n   have sex.\"\n\n   Names have been changed.\n\n    Joanna Briscoe's novel, Sleep With Me, is published on July 4 by\n   Bloomsbury at 12.99.

        "articleBody": "Explaining loss of positions to a future employer\n\n   By Andrea Wolf, Globe Correspondent, 6/20/04\n\n    Q. At the end of 2000, I was laid off from a job that I loved.\n   The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work.\n   I was devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my\n   way. I wasn't thrilled with the job but I worked hard and was rewarded\n   with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three\n   years of employment. Last month, I found myself standing in the\n   unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor\n   business climates and not performance, I feel embarrassed and\n   discouraged. I have stellar references from both employers, including\n   the managers who made the layoff decisions, but I am concerned about\n   what future employers may think. I also wonder if I may be in the\n   wrong profession since I have been dispensable to two employers. Do\n   you have any suggestions as to how I can handle the interview process\n   to put a more positive spin on the situation?\n\n    A. You are faced with a common situation in today's job market.\n   Many companies are downsizing and cutting strong performers like\n   yourself. It is evident that you were highly valued by both companies.\n\n   What is important for you to internalize is that your position was\n   eliminated for business, not personal reasons. Remember to reflect on\n   the key strengths and benefits you brought the company.\n\n   You raise the uncomfortable feelings of how to explain your job loss\n   to a future employer. Prepare a ''reason for leaving'' statement. You\n   want to develop a statement that is truthful and acceptable to your\n   previous and prospective employer. Keep it short, factual, and\n   positive. I recommend a three-part story:\n\n   Background: A brief and positive description of your role and\n   responsibilities.\n\n   Facts: The company faced an economic downturn and your position was\n   eliminated.\n\n   Moving forward: Therefore, you are looking to utilize your skills in a\n   new position.\n\n   As a result of the layoff, you seem to be questioning if you are\n   working in the wrong profession. It sounds like you jumped too quickly\n   into your second job without evaluating the fit.\n\n   Consider this as a good time to do some self-assessment. You can start\n   by looking at the skills you most enjoyed in your positions and ask\n   for feedback from colleagues. Then you could explore other interest\n   areas through networking. Since you are at a turning point, you may\n   want to consider career coaching so that you can make a good decision\n   in your next position.\n\n   IT workers may need to reevaluate careers\n\n    Q. I'm one of the many IT workers who have been out of work in my\n   field for a very long time. I had not planned a career change as I\n   enjoyed what I was doing. However, I'm really starting to wonder if\n   it's time to think about doing something else. I just don't feel from\n   what I read about outsourcing that the IT sector will recover. What\n   are your thoughts?\n\n    A. Offshore outsourcing is a growing phenomenon affecting\n   technology professionals who remain underemployed or out of work, like\n   yourself.\n\n   Although some areas in IT are expected to rebound as the economy\n   strengthens, outsourcing to India and Southeast Asia has caused great\n   competition for existing industry positions.\n\n   According to market research firm, Gartner Inc., business process\n   offshoring is expected to reach $1.8 billion in 2003 on a global\n   basis, representing a 38 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n   Two years is a long time to be out of work. Such a hiatus from the\n   workplace is worthy of a serious reevaluation of your IT career. The\n   field has been hit hard but there are some opportunities that are\n   beginning to open up depending on expertise.\n\n   As a starting point, determine what skills you have that tap into the\n   current market needs for IT specialists. If your skill set is valued,\n   then you need to evaluate your job search strategy.\n\n   Ask yourself: How and where did you deliver value in your previous\n   job? What did you contribute that made your business group successful?\n   How current is your skill base?\n\n   It's also worth exploring whether you have the required qualifications\n   and skills the market demands. You may want to pursue further\n   education or training to broaden your experience.\n\n   What other skills and knowledge do you have? For example, do you have\n   experience with administrative IT programs in project management,\n   payroll, or accounting systems? These skills may help you present\n   yourself to other industries. If you have an understanding of an\n   industry sector and its technology needs, then that may be an\n   advantage to you.\n\n   I have seen many IT professionals who have thoroughly scoured the job\n   market with no success and have decided to work as contract\n   consultants or take project-based work assignments on a temporary\n   basis. This allows employers some staffing and cost flexibility.\n   Sometimes these assignments can lead to full-time positions.\n\n   With all the changes in the market, everyone needs to be current in\n   their field. In addition, we need to understand outsourcing's impact\n   on business. The nature of work is changing so dramatically that most\n   economists haven't even figured out the implications yet. Although we\n   see the trend of outsourcing IT jobs to some countries and a decrease\n   in these jobs in the United States, it is unclear what the future\n   holds.\n\n   With any change comes both risk and opportunity. IT professionals may\n   need to focus on the career paths that globalization is creating.\n\n   If many programming positions have disappeared, consider developing\n   skills in understanding and translating business processes and\n   utilizing project management experience. Doing so might enable IT\n   professionals to position themselves as the liaison for offshore\n   development projects.\n\n   To be competitive, IT professionals can no longer rely on their\n   technical expertise solely but need to have expertise in industry\n   specific business practices. They will need to be able to translate\n   business needs to IT practices.\n\n   Some points to consider as you examine your career options:\n     * Look at your additional skills and become more of a generalist as\n       you will be better positioned if you are skilled in both\n       technology and the business side of IT.\n\n     * Look to smaller organizations. Fortune 500 companies will focus\n       most on offshoring.\n\n     * Start your own consulting business if you have the entrepreneurial\n       spirit.\n\n     * Look into areas of growth such as healthcare and education.\n\n     * Get further education to update skills and retrain.\n\n     * Explore changing career fields through the help of one-stop career\n       centers or career counseling.\n\n\n   Staying, complaining won't help your career\n\n    Q. I will be leaving my current position in about a year. My\n   annual review is in a few weeks. I recently discovered that someone\n   hired five months ago started at a salary $1,500 a year higher than\n   mine, even though we both have an identical job title and description.\n   I was told by my headhunter when the job was offered to me that there\n   would be no negotiation of salary, so I accepted the offer as it\n   stood. There are multiple problems at work including rampant turnover,\n   low employee morale, and favoritism on the part of the office manager.\n   Do I ignore the salary imbalance and just say ''good riddance'' to the\n   job when it comes time to move on? Do I confront the office manager\n   during my annual review and ask about the disparity in salaries? Do I\n   contact the firm's human resources manager and discuss the disparity\n   with him? Do I contact him now or wait to see what is offered at my\n   review?\n\n    A. You may want to reevaluate your plan of staying in your\n   present job for one more year. Why are you waiting to leave if you\n   detest your boss and see both an unequal salary as well as limited\n   future growth potential? If you are holding on for one more year in\n   hopes of a higher salary, don't hold your breath.\n\n   You do not describe any positive actions you have taken. I wonder what\n   efforts you have made to work more effectively with your boss.\n   Remember, you were hired to provide skills that help your company and\n   it is your job to meet your boss' needs.\n\n   If the differences are too great, then you have a choice: leave the\n   company. To stay, complain, and hang in there demonstrates an attitude\n   that will not help you progress in your career.\n\n   Regarding the salary issue, you can always ask for what you think is\n   fair in the negotiation with your hiring manager before accepting the\n   offer. At this point, however, I think that raising the salary issue\n   is a waste of your time and may create ill will.\n\n   In the future, be wary of a headhunter who says there is no\n   negotiation. They are working for the company to fill the job and not\n   necessarily for your best interests. Understand that negotiation is a\n   natural part of developing a win-win situation with a future employer.\n\n   I advise you to view your situation as a learning experience so that\n   moving forward you can proceed at your professional best.\n\n   Be upfront about need for flexible schedule\n\n    Q. I am looking for a 24- or 30-hour-a-week position, and I am\n   considering applying for positions that are advertised as full time.\n   My hope is being able to negotiate shorter hours, or do job sharing.\n   My field is health services research. Positions are often grant-funded\n   in this field, and I have been told that there is often room for\n   flexibility in setting work hours. At what point in the application\n   process should I disclose that I am seeking part-time work?\n\n    A. The field of health services research may allow for\n   flexibility in scheduling, but my advice is go for the position as\n   advertised so that you do not eliminate yourself up front. In the\n   interview, you can ask about the job expectations to get a fuller\n   picture of the position without hinting that you want part time.\n\n   Your goal is to interview well, get the job offer, and then have a\n   follow-up meeting where you can negotiate for flex time or reduced\n   hours. Be prepared to share how you will get all the work done within\n   that time frame and how you can be most productive.\n\n   You are at a much greater advantage to ask for changes after you have\n   received the offer. Since the company offered you the position, they\n   value you above the other applicants and may be willing to accommodate\n   you.\n\n   Andrea Wolf is vice president of career management at Right Management\n   Consultants.\n\n   Need advice about managing your career or workplace?

        "articleBody": "FEBRUARY 16, 2004\n\n   NEWS: ANALYSIS & COMMENTARY\n   The Budget: Hey Guys, Get Real\n   President Bush says he wants to cut the deficit in half by 2009.\n   Here's why that's not likely to happen\n   Under increasing pressure from conservatives, George W. Bush, a man\n   not known as a penny-pincher, is seeking to make fiscal restraint a\n   centerpiece of his fiscal 2005 budget. After three years of surging\n   deficits, Bush is sounding like an old-school GOP budget hawk. \"With\n   spending restraint and continued pro-growth economic policies, we can\n   cut the deficit in half over the next five years,\" he says.\n\n   Bush's Feb. 2 fiscal blueprint indeed proposes to cut the deficit in\n   half by 2009. And, if it were adopted, it would effectively freeze\n   funding for one high-profile chunk of domestic spending for the next\n   five years. But critics argue that in the end, as they say in Texas,\n   the President is all hat, no cattle.\n   Why? For starters, the budget does nothing to trim massive spending on\n   entitlements, by far the largest chunk of federal spending. Instead,\n   to hit his deficit target, Bush relies on a five-year freeze on the\n   much smaller spending that goes into hundreds of domestic programs,\n   such as law enforcement, environmental protection, housing, and\n   education.\n   FIVE-YEAR PLAN.\n   Yet even that is largely illusory, given that Congress\n   has never accepted that level of restraint. Even less realistic: The\n   budget calls for no additional funding for Iraq and Afghanistan after\n   Sept. 30, even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\n   figures reconstruction of the two war-torn countries could cost $50\n   billion and continued occupation will cost at least an additional $20\n   billion a year.\n   Perhaps most misleading, Bush is offering up a five-year budget rather\n   than the traditional 10-year plan. In doing so, he is hiding the\n   long-term costs of last year's Medicare drug law, big future hikes in\n   Pentagon spending for non-Iraq-related projects, and the impact of his\n   latest $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan. Indeed, the President's latest plan\n   includes the $990 billion cost of making his '01 and '03 tax cuts\n   permanent as well as $300 billion in new subsidies for saving and\n   buying health insurance. But less than 20%, or about $200 billion, of\n   the revenue drain will take effect through 2009. The rest will occur\n   in 2010-14 -- meaning ballooning deficits just past the horizon of the\n   five-year budget estimates.\n   So how serious are Congress and the President about deficit reduction?\n   Politicians will come to blows over a handful of fiscal matters in the\n   coming months. Pay special attention to battles over two major bills\n   -- one to build and repair highways, airports, and mass transit; the\n   other a long-awaited energy bill aimed at providing subsidies to\n   domestic producers with the stated goal of reducing reliance on\n   foreign oil. And don't forget the fight over Bush's proposed tax cuts.\n   Capitol Hill conservatives are putting heavy pressure on Bush to\n   restrain spending even more than he has proposed. And, already, rising\n   deficits have opened a major rift within the GOP. On one side,\n   hardliners such as House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) see the\n   deficit as a wedge into the issue they really care about -- shrinking\n   the size of government. On the other, traditional fiscal conservatives\n   such as Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.) favor government spending for\n   domestic programs but worry about red ink. Then there are the\n   lawmakers whose main concern is protecting home-state projects. The\n   GOP chairmen of both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees\n   are warning that they can't pass Bush's freeze.\n   With an election looming, most Democrats and many Republicans prefer\n   to avoid chopping popular programs. \"It's going to be a very difficult\n   budget year,\" says House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle\n   (R-Okla.).\n   The first test of fiscal credibility will come when Congress acts on a\n   massive six-year transportation bill. House committees favor spending\n   $375 billion. The Senate is debating a $318 billion version. But the\n   Administration warns that Bush will veto any measure that costs more\n   than $256 billion. There is little chance Congress will O.K. less than\n   $285 billion. So in any my-way-or-the-highway showdown with Bush, who\n   has yet to veto any spending bills, bet on the highway to win.\n   A second test will come once debate on the long-delayed energy bill\n   starts again. Bush initially asked for $20 billion in production\n   incentives. That has ballooned to $31 billion as a result of added\n   congressional pork. The White House is trying to trim the measure. But\n   unless lawmakers scale it back to $20 billion or less, it will be hard\n   to claim fiscal discipline.\n   Then there are taxes. There's no chance Bush will win approval of his\n   full $1.3 trillion tax package. But GOP lawmakers will push to make\n   permanent a fistful of middle-class breaks that were first adopted in\n   2001 but due to expire over the next few years. They include\n   marriage-penalty relief, an increase in the child credit, and a\n   temporary fix to the painful alternative minimum tax. But if Congress\n   is serious about deficit reduction, it will have to ditch much of the\n   tax package\n   NICKELS AND DIMES?\n   Already, legislators are looking at finessing the\n   Bush budget. One strategy: delay key spending votes until after the\n   elections. Another idea is to grant Bush's total $800 billion-plus\n   spending request for all nonentitlement programs but shift funds from\n   defense to domestic priorities. Congress would still give Bush the\n   money he wants for the Pentagon -- but in a later supplemental bill of\n   about $50 billion. In the yearend confusion, the President could take\n   credit for holding down spending, while getting all the money he wants\n   for defense.\n   But even if such a strategy succeeds in holding spending down in 2005,\n   it is unlikely to have much impact on long-term deficits. That's\n   because the programs the President wants to freeze represent barely\n   one-fifth of the budget, making his newfound deficit concerns seem\n   illusory at best. Environmental protection, crime prevention, and the\n   like may be important to many Americans, but they don't cost much --\n   at least not by Washington standards. Of the $2.4 trillion that Bush\n   would spend in '05, these domestic programs account for just $485\n   billion. \"This is not the problem,\" says Robert L. Bixby, director of\n   the Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit group.\n   The real money is in defense -- which will cost nearly $428 billion\n   next year, even without Iraq -- and the entitlement programs such as\n   Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The big three will soak up a\n   staggering $1 trillion next year. And, says the CBO, they will cost\n   more than $1.4 trillion a year by 2010.\n   To put it another way, Washington will be arguing over a mere $10\n   billion in domestic programs. By contrast, Medicare spending will\n   increase by more than twice that next year -- even before a costly new\n   drug benefit kicks in. \"Spending will not be brought under control\n   until entitlements are seriously reformed,\" says Heritage Foundation\n   budget expert Brian M. Reidl. \"You can't nickel-and-dime your way to\n   balancing the budget.\"\n   Not that $10 billion doesn't matter. And fiscal responsibility needs\n   to start somewhere. But Bush's budget -- and the likely congressional\n   response to it -- will prove to be little more than election-year\n   gamesmanship. It may help Bush, who could claim progress toward fiscal\n   restraint. And it will allow lawmakers to campaign with new ribbons to\n   cut. What the budget gymnastics won't do, however, is reduce the\n   deficit by very much.\n   By Howard Gleckman, with Paul Magnusson and Stan Crock, in Washington"

My\n   research up to the present will be continued, but with modifications\n   in equipment and methods of data.  The two troops differ since Troop I\n   consists of a family group with four members; the breeding male Corey,\n   his son Tomas and daughter Sara, and a non-breeding female named Sissi\n   who is the Coreys sister.  The mother of Tomas and Sara died while\n   giving birth to Sara.  Troop II consists of three unrelated males,\n   with two more unrelated males who are currently in isolation to be\n   introduced in the near future.  Troop I is one of only two captive\n   family troops of woolly monkeys in the world; the other is located in\n   London, England.\n\n               The video recordings were analyzed frame-by-frame using a\n   proprietary video digitization program.  The vocalizations were\n   recorded by the video camera as well and analyzed using Sound Forge to\n   make sound spectrographs, or sonograms.  A programmed Palm Pilot was\n   used to record the movement and behavior of both troops in order to\n   make ethograms to display patterns of behavior and vocalization.\n\n               The following was anticipated:\n\t\t\t   1. vocalizations would be\n   correlated with visual displays;\n   2. display function would be\n   identified through context;\n   3 individuals would be identified through\n   harmonics in the sonograms;\n   4. the behavior and vocalizations of the\n   two troops would differ; and\n   5. the behavioral analysis would be\n   useful for maintaining and breeding captive troops.\n\n\n\n   Introduction\n\n               The common woolly monkey (Lagothrix lagothricha), also\n   known as Humboldt's woolly monkey, is found only in South America in\n   the Amazon River Basin of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and\n   Venezuela.  They range in all canopy levels of primary rainforest as\n   well as gallery forests, and have been found in mountainous areas and\n   cloud forests up to 3,000 meters.  The classification of the common\n   woolly monkey is as follows:\n\n   Taxon\n\n                              Classification\n\n   Kingdom\n\n   Animalia\n\n   Phylum\n\n   Chordata\n\n   Class\n\n   Mammalia\n\n   Order\n\n   Primates\n\n   Suborder\n\n   Haplorrhini\n\n   Family\n\n   Cebidae\n\n   Subfamily\n\n   Atelinae\n\n   Genus\n\n   Lagothrix\n\n   Species\n\n   lagothricha\n\n\n               The morphology of the common woolly monkey is similar to\n   that of other monkeys in the Atelinae subfamily.  The woolly monkey is\n   the largest monkey in South America, with the female weight averaging\n   11 pounds and the male weight averaging 15 pounds.  They have a\n   prehensile tail that can support their full weight and is used for\n   feeding and locomotion.  Woolly monkeys can have dark brown, pale\n   brown, dark gray, pale gray, reddish-brown, or black fur.  The limbs,\n   tail, and head are usually darker than the back, with the face being\n   black and the palms of the hands and feet being pink.  Slight sexual\n   dimorphism exists including the canines, body, and head in the males\n   being longer than females.  However, the female's tail is longer than\n   the male's and the female's clitoris is longer than the males' penis,\n   which sometimes makes it difficult to determine the sex in the wild.\n\n               Humboldt's woolly monkey is primarily frugivorous, but\n   they also feed on leaves, seeds, flowers, and some invertebrates and\n   small mammals.  In captivity they have been known to prey upon birds\n   that fly into their cages.  The group size for woolly monkeys averages\n   10-12 group members, but much larger groups are known to exist.\n   Subgroups sometimes form and travel independently from the larger\n   group.  Woolly monkeys are not territorial and allow group ranges to\n   overlap and have been known to forage alongside each other as well as\n   other species in their family.  The woolly monkey travels through the\n   forest quadrupedally using its tail as a fifth arm.  They rarely come\n   down to the ground and, therefore, are known to be almost totally\n   arboreal.  They even sleep 150 feet above the ground in the canopy.\n   When on the ground, which is especially rare in the wild, they walk\n   bipedally, using their arms and tail to balance.  The tail is\n   extremely important and is always anchored to something; it is used to\n   pick up objects and sometimes even allows the monkeys to rest by\n   hanging from just the tail.\n\n               The social structure of the common woolly monkey is a\n   multi-male-multi-female group in which a hierarchy exists between the\n   males in the group.  The dominance hierarchy is determined by\n   play-fighting and age.  The species' mating system is polygamous\n   because each receptive female mates with every male in the group, with\n   the most dominant males receiving the most copulations.  Because of\n   this, the male that succeeds in passing on his genes is the one that\n   releases more and better-fit sperm per session, with multiple sessions\n   increasing the likelihood.  Therefore, every male mates with every\n   female, but only one female is copulated with at any given time.  In\n   addition to receiving the most copulations, the most dominant males\n   also receive the most social grooming and are known to protect mothers\n   and their infants from others in the group.  In general, adult and\n   subadult males are dominant over all other members in the group.\n\n               Male woolly monkeys are philopatric, which means that the\n   males stay in the group in which they were born, known as their natal\n   group, while the females leave their natal group.  Female dispersion\n   usually occurs between the ages of five and a half years to six years,\n   the same ages that females begin to mate.  Although females begin to\n   mate between those ages, they remain sterile and do not conceive until\n   one to three years after they leave their natal groups.  The gestation\n   period averages seven and a half months, or about 223 days, and the\n   female gives birth to one young about every two to three years during\n   the birthing season, which occurs between the months of August and\n   December.  After birth, the infants nurse from sixteen to twenty\n   months, traveling independently by six months.\n\n               Little research on woolly monkeys exists, with the\n   majority of the research focused on ecology, morphology, location,\n   social structure, and so on.  Research on the behavior and\n   vocalizations of the common woolly monkey is almost completely\n   nonexistent.  The research on woolly monkey behavior and vocalization\n   that has been done was performed by M. Ramirez and published through\n   the World Wildlife Fund in 1988.  His research was made into a\n   \"dictionary\" that explained the behavior or reason behind each\n   vocalization, which he spelled out using human phonetics.  He also\n   explained some of the woolly monkeys' visual communication.  Although\n   thorough in some respects, his research did not investigate sequences\n   of behavior and vocalization or analyze each individual separately\n   with respect to behavior and vocalization sequences.\n\n   Methods\n\n               My research on the common woolly monkey was conducted at\n   the Louisville Zoo, one of only two places in the world that have a\n   captive family troop.  After being formally introduced to the monkeys\n   by the head veterinarian, I was able to begin collecting data.  Before\n   starting the data collection process, I decided to spend a few weeks\n   observing the two troops in order to become acquainted with the\n   individuals.  During the three weeks of strict observation, I took\n   notice of each behavior and began compiling a list of the observed\n   behaviors.  This list is located in the results and discussion\n   section.  I also realized that not only could I tell the monkeys apart\n   visually, but vocally as well.  After becoming familiar with the\n   behaviors (displays) and vocalizations of the monkeys, I began\n   collecting data.\n\n               The data collection consisted of a variety of methods\n   including the use of an 8 mm video camera to record behaviors, a mini\n   disk recorder to record the vocalizations, and a proprietary Palm\n   Pilot program to record the movement and behavior of each individual\n   in the two troops as well as the overall behavior of each troop.  At\n   first, I videotaped the woolly monkeys individually.  This method was\n   not effective because the behavior of the other woolly monkeys could\n   not be seen and the monkeys move extremely fast and it is difficult to\n   follow them around the cage.  I then tried to videotape sections of\n   the cage, but that did not work well either because I could not\n   differentiate between the monkeys because of the cameras bad\n   resolution.  After four hours of recording over one month, I realized\n   that I needed a much better video camera in order to continue with the\n   research.  For my future research I will have a video camera with\n   superior resolution.  The video recordings that I had were used to\n   learn and practice the digitization process.  The recordings were\n   digitized and transferred to compact disk for later analysis.  The\n   digitized version of the video recordings could be analyzed at 1/10 of\n   a second, with the potential advantages including the ability to\n   record the behavior at set intervals, allowing the viewer to record\n   the behavior of all the monkeys in view.\n\n               The mini disk recorder was used in conjunction with the\n   video camera.  I experienced multiple difficulties and problems with\n   the mini disk recorder that eventually led me to discontinue using it\n   in this project.  This will be discussed further in the results and\n   discussion section.  Because I did not have any vocalizations\n   recorded, I decided to use the sound from the video recordings for my\n   vocalization analysis.  Sound Forge, a computer program used for the\n   sound analysis, enabled me to make sound spectrographs, or sonograms,\n   on the woolly monkey vocalizations.  In order to analyze just the\n   woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of the background noise,\n   adjustment was required. With Sound Forge, I was able to delete all of\n   the outside and background noise that included crickets, birds,\n   trains, human voices, and so on.\n\n               The proprietary Palm Pilot program used for recording the\n   behaviors was called Pen Recorder and the program used to analyze the\n   recordings was called Pen Reviewer.  Below are diagrams of Pen\n   Recorder, Pen Reviewer, and View Data.\n\n   When using Pen Recorder, I had to designate letters of the alphabet to\n   the observed behaviors.  Once I started Pen Recorder, I wrote the\n   letter of every behavior that I observed an individual doing until\n   they went inside or went to sleep.  This method was difficult because\n   it was impossible to keep up with the behaviors while having to\n   remember which letter went with which behavior as well as write the\n   letter and then keep going.  The collected data was viewed in Pen\n   Reviewer under View Data, displayed above, and then analyzed in the\n   form of a graph, time line, and matrix, displayed below.\n\n   After using this technique for a while, I decided to change my method\n   of recording because of the above stated reason as well as the fact\n   that certain monkeys were more active than the others and I had to\n   start and stop recording for the different individuals, which does not\n   heed good results for analysis.  For my further research, I will be\n   using a new method of recording behaviors.  Instead of using the\n   proprietary Palm Pilot program, I will be using a tablet PC with a\n   voice recognition program so I can just speak each behavior as it\n   occurs.\n\n   Results & Discussion\n\n               The individual woolly monkeys of Troop I each have\n   extremely different personalities, rank, age, relationships, etc.  The\n   family troop consists of four related individuals:\n\n\n   Name\n\n                                Birth Date\n\n                                    Age\n\n   Corey\n\n   11/13/91\n\n   11 years\n\n   Sissi\n\n   09/29/95\n\n   7 years & 2 months\n\n   Tomas\n\n   12/01/98\n\n   3 years & 11 months\n\n   Sara\n\n   12/07/00\n\n   1 year & 11 months\n\n          Corey                              Sissi\n        Sara                           Tomas\n\n\n               Corey is the dominant breeding male and is father to both\n   Sara and Tomas.  Sissi is Corey's sister and is the dominant\n   non-breeding female.  Sissi has never had any offspring and is\n   considered sterile.  The position of the second most dominant member\n   of the troop is currently being fought over between Sissi and Tomas.\n   Because Tomas is a subadult male and Sissi is an adult female, he and\n   Sissi fight over everything, from food to where to sleep.  Thomas and\n   Sara are siblings and fight and play in ways similar to human\n   siblings, but still show affection quite often, grooming each other\n   and resting next to each other.\n\n               Tomas and his father Corey appear to have the closest\n   relationship within the group.  Tomas follows Corey around, mimicking\n   certain behaviors.  When Tomas and Sara are resting together or\n   grooming each other, Corey generally joins them.  Strange to human\n   viewers, the family troop members are sexual with each other,\n   especially Corey and Tomas and Corey and Sara.  Sexuality between\n   family members is surprisingly common in the primate world.  According\n   to primate research, it is quite normal for a father and son to feel\n   on each other's genitals and have erections when around one another.\n   These behaviors are considered greetings and are meant to establish\n   friendly contact, usually occurring between adult males and juveniles\n   of both sexes.  During my observations, I noticed that Corey and Sissi\n   rarely interact, while the same is true for Sara and Sissi.\n\n               The monkeys in the family troop have differing\n   personalities, with Corey as the alpha male.  He is the largest\n   monkey, with huge canines and constant eye movement that indicates a\n   neurological disorder, though not apparent in any other way.  Corey\n   never plays and is always pacing the cage, eating, grooming himself or\n   others, staring at outside disturbances, or resting.  Only after about\n   a month of observation Corey appeared not to consider me an outside\n   threat anymore, showing behaviors indicating a friendly greeting and\n   then calming down other group members through appeasement behaviors.\n   This meant that I could now observe their behavior undisturbed by\n   outsiders.  Tomas is more of a loner for the majority of the time; shy\n   toward outsiders, he never makes eye contact with me, which is unlike\n   all the others in the group.  When not off by himself, Tomas is\n   playing or play fighting with Sara, fighting with Sissi, or grooming\n   or resting with Corey and/or Sara.\n\n    Corey staring      Tomas hiding    Sissi & Tomas    Sissi\n   walking         Sara eating\n\n                                                                 fighting\n\n\n               Sissi is the most unsocial member of the group, only\n   interacting with the others when fighting with Tomas.  She is,\n   however, active toward me, cage shaking, which is a sign that she\n   feels threatened, and intense staring sessions at me, most likely\n   indicating that she does not approve of my presence.  When not\n   interacting with Tomas or me, Sissi rests high up in the top of the\n   cage, far away from everything and everyone else.  Sara on the other\n   hand is the most active and social member of the group.  Sara is\n   always doing something, whether watching me, playing with Tomas,\n   resting with Corey and/or Tomas, eating, playing by herself with toys,\n   or just running around bipedally on the cage floor.  The youngest,\n   most curious and loving of the group, she is the one that has tried to\n   make contact with me the most and is the most affectionate toward\n   others.\n\n               Below is a table listing the observed behaviors, their\n   description, and the individuals in which the behaviors were observed.\n\n   Behavior\n\n                                Description\n\n              Individuals In Which The Behavior Was Observed\n\n   Eat\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Play\n\n   Self explanatory; includes biting, running, climbing, rolling around,\n   etc.\n\n   Sara, Tomas\n\n   Chestrub\n\n   Rub object against chest to scent mark; usually only done by males\n\n   Corey, Tomas, Sara\n\n   Swing\n\n   Self explanatory; on ropes or around the cage\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Walk Quadrapedally\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Fight\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Groom\n\n   Each other or themselves\n\n   Corey, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Walk Bipedally\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Teeth Chatter\n\n   Dominant male moves jaws up and down rapidly, chattering his teeth;\n   threat display or sexual arousal display\n\n   Corey\n\n   Jump\n\n   Self explanatory; on floor, up to cage or rope, etc.\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Climb cage\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Climb Rope\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Cage Shake\n\n   Use all four limbs to shake the cage; threat display\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara\n\n   Rub\n\n   Use hands to rub on each others bodies; brings appeasement and\n   strengthens close relationships\n\n   Corey, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Bite\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Grasp With Tail\n\n   Use 5^th limb to hold on to objects or pick up objects\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Stare\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara\n\n   Hump\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Tomas\n\n   Copulation Attempt\n\n   Attempt to copulate with another individual; practice for actual\n   copulation; occurs between males and females and between males\n\n   Corey, Tomas, Sara\n\n   Run\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Yawn\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Lick\n\n   Themselves, each other, or various objects including the floor and the\n   cage\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Masturbate\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Tomas\n\n   Feel On Genitals\n\n   Feel on own or another individuals genitals; display of friendship and\n   is thought to bring appeasement\n\n   Corey, Tomas\n\n   Reach For Me\n\n   Self explanatory; reach out of cage to try to touch me\n\n   Corey, Sara\n\n   Rest\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Sneeze\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Drink\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Scratch\n\n   Self explanatory; usually themselves\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Hang\n\n   Upside-down with tail grasping object and supporting entire body\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Reach Out Of Cage\n\n   Self explanatory; usually to get leaves, sticks, or other food dropped\n   outside of the cage\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n   Sit\n\n   Self explanatory\n\n   Corey, Sissi, Sara, Tomas\n\n\n   In addition to using the video recording of the woolly monkeys for\n   behavioral analysis, it was also used for sound analysis.  I used a\n   computer program called Sound Forge, which enabled me to make sound\n   spectrographs, or sonograms, of the woolly monkey vocalizations. In\n   order to analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of\n   the background noise, adjustment was required.  Using Sound Forge\n   enabled me to delete all of the outside and background noise including\n   crickets, birds, trains, human voices, and so on.  I was able to\n   produce several sonograms from the data collected by listening to the\n   sounds while watching the screen and marking where I heard common\n   sounds of the woolly monkey.  These common sounds included shrieks,\n   squeaks, and grunts.\n\n   I then performed a spectrum analysis, an option in Sound Forge, in\n   order to view the vocalizations in the form of a sound spectrograph.\n   Although this analysis is not yet complete, it will be continued in\n   the future.  After more spectrographs are made and analyzed, I will be\n   able to differentiate between individuals just by looking at their\n   sonograms because it is my hypothesis that each individual produces\n   different sound spectrographs although they make the same\n   vocalizations.  The human ear might not be able to differentiate\n   between individuals when they are making the same sounds as others so\n   this data will be useful in further vocalization research in woolly\n   monkey populations.\n\n   The sound spectrograph below is of a squeak.\n\n\n\n\n   The next sound spectrograph is of a screech.\n\n\n\n               The last sound spectrograph is of a grunt.\n\n\n\n\n   For my further research, I will be using a new method to record\n   behaviors.  Instead of using the proprietary Palm Pilot program, I\n   will be using a tablet PC with a voice recognition program so I can\n   just speak each behavior as it occurs.  The program is called Dragon\n   records what I say and analyzes the data in a similar manner to that\n   of the proprietary Palm Pilot program.  I will also be using an Elura\n   40 digital video camcorder, which has superior resolution and sound\n   quality combined with the ability to take digital photographs.  The\n   camera also has a steadier that eliminates most of the shakiness from\n   holding the camera.\n\n   The observation of Troop II will begin when the two new unrelated male\n   monkeys are introduced to Monkey Island.  I will continue recording\n   more vocalizations and perform more in depth analysis using Sound\n   Forge.  This research will be helpful in teaching zoo personnel and\n   others interested in woolly monkeys about their behaviors and\n   vocalizations, as well as being useful for maintaining and breeding\n   captive troops.\n     _________________________________________________________________"

Many people are totally unaware of this. The\n   courtship of fishes in not as complex nor as varied as that of men and\n   women, and the courtship of fishes is not complicated by innuendos,\n   hidden meanings and cryptic signals as in Homo sapiens. Rather,\n   courtship in fishes, as with birds, mammals and other animals,\n   comprises sets of recognisable signals, following set sequences which\n   for fishes, provided the partners are physiologically ready, culminate\n   in spawning. Courtship behaviour of fishes might be a simple set of\n   signals and answers or it might be very elaborate and complex,\n   depending on the type of fish. However, the signals are always easy\n   for potential mates to read. Indeed, it is easy for biologists to read\n   and interpret these signals.\n\n   Among the most interesting and best known to aquarists is the\n   elaborate courtship of cichlid fishes. Typically a male develops a\n   territory which he defends from all intruders. Many species also build\n   nests, which might be elaborate sand castles, or excavations with\n   tunnels or burrows, or may simply be a cleaned part of the rocky or\n   sandy area in which the territory is held. Once the tasks of\n   developing a territory and building a nest are complete the male is\n   ready to invite females to his nest to spawn. Eager males may attempt\n   to do this even before the nest is complete, but they are nearly\n   always refused as the female does not get all the correct messages if\n   the nest is not there. One of the reasons for this is that part of the\n   courtship ritual includes the nest, and each nest type is\n   species-specific; it is a characteristic of the species that is\n   important to mate recognition and the acceptance of the correct\n   partner.\n\n   The initial invitation is `side-shake' during which the male\n   approaches a female, extends his fins and flexes so that the anal fin,\n   which usually has attractive spots and colours on it, towards the\n   female. If the female is interested the male then turns away and\n   facing the spawning site beats its tail in a movement inviting the\n   female to follow (`follow-shake'). If the female is still interested,\n   then with exaggerated, undulating movements the male leads the female\n   to the spawning site (lead-swim). Once in the nest or spawning site,\n   the couple circle each other, perform a variety of shakes (nest shake,\n   vertical nest shake etc) and gently nudge each other till the female\n   lays eggs. The female then picks up the eggs in her mouth, sometimes\n   doing so before the male has had time to fertilise them. This would be\n   a waste of eggs, so to solve the problem the males of many species\n   have dummy eggs on the anal fin. This fin is spread out in front of\n   the female to display the egg dummies and curled slightly to hold\n   spermatozoa that he will release. The female tries to pick the egg\n   dummies from the male anal fin and in doing so collects spermatozoa,\n   that fertilise the eggs in her mouth. The need to collect the eggs\n   before they are fertilised arose from the fact that eggs are often\n   stolen almost as soon as they appear by other fishes which feed upon\n   them. Another problem is that males that do not have territories, and\n   were not chosen as mates by the female, try to sneak spawnings by\n   darting down between the spawning couple and fertilising eggs that are\n   exposed. By collecting the eggs promptly, the efforts of robbers and\n   sneakers are largely circumvented.\n\n   Once in the mouth the eggs develop into young fish that remain there\n   until they are ready to feed for themselves. Most cichlids will then\n   look after their young for sometime (a few days to four or more\n   weeks), taking them into their mouths when there is a threat from\n   predators. The fry are also taken into the mouth at night for\n   safekeeping. Once the fry are independent they leave the care of the\n   mother. Some cichlids behave as cuckoos; they give their fry to\n   another species to care for. It seems that the foster parent can\n   recognise the foreign young, but she is unable to chase them away or\n   swallow them as both activities will endanger her own brood. Chasing\n   foreign fry that are mixed tightly in a school with ones own fry is\n   not possible without chasing away the own fry too. Similarly, how does\n   the mother swallow foreign fry and not her own?\n\n   Submitted by: Dr Tony Ribbink\n\n   Email:\n   A.Ribbink@ru.ac.za"

At all times, there was always one\n   program that dominated the others in searches. First it was Napster,\n   which ended as the #3 term of 2001. When the government took Napster\n   down, that led to the rise of Morpheus, the #5 term of 2002. Then\n   Morpheus had troubles and was replaced as the dominant software by the\n   capitalization-challenged KaZaA and its spyware-free cousin, KaZaA\n   Lite.\n\n   KaZaA shot up the Lycos 50 in mid-2002 and ended last year as the #64\n   term of 2002. This year, it spent 15 weeks as the number one search\n   term on our weekly list and only dropped out of the top five for two\n   weeks during the Iraq War when The Lycos 50 was dominated by\n   war-related search terms. During 2003, KaZaA received twice as many\n   searches as all other file-swapping softwares put together. Only one\n   other file swapper, WinMX (#86), makes the top 100. Napster falls from\n   #49 to #165, while Audiogalaxy, which was #74 for 2002, falls out of\n   the top 500 terms.\n\n   Dragonball falls from two straight years at #1 to the #3 spot, and in\n   between comes the resurgent Britney Spears at #2. Actually, Britney\n   had fallen out of the weekly top ten by the middle of 2003, but in\n   August she climbed back to the top following a succession of publicity\n   stunts generating oodles of queries from curious Lycos users. Between\n   her topless photos on the covers of Elle Magazine (U.K. edition) and\n   Rolling Stone, her bottomless photo on the cover of Esquire and most\n   significantly, her kiss with Madonna (#84) during the MTV Video Music\n   Awards, Web users were searching for Britney one more time.\n\n   2003 was also a very significant year for huge stories that dominated\n   Internet traffic for weeks at a time. The two biggest stories we have\n   tracked since we began the Lycos 50 in 1999 were the September 11\n   terrorist attacks and the 2000 election and recount, but the next\n   three biggest events -- if you count searches over a two- to\n   three-week period -- all occurred in 2003. They were the War in Iraq\n   (#15), the rape allegation against NBA star Kobe Bryant (#6), and the\n   Paris Hilton sex tape. (#4)\n\n   March and April saw Lycos inundated for searches related to the war.\n   This was a more conventionally fought war than the one in Afghanistan\n   last year, and for the first time in history people could follow the\n   news of the war in real time through the Internet. In particular,\n   people at offices without access to television used the Internet to\n   keep up to date on the latest news. The Internet also significantly\n   changed the way people followed the Iraq War because of the\n   availability of foreign news sources offering differing opinions of\n   the actions taken by the United States. Lycos users searched for\n   newspapers from around the world, such as Le Monde, Arab News, and The\n   Jerusalem Post.\n\n   By far the most-searched news source from outside the United States\n   was the Arabic Al-Jazeera cable news network. Whenever information is\n   not available through conventional news sources, we've found that\n   Internet searches multiply, and this is what happened when the video\n   of American prisoners of war captured in Iraq became available through\n   the Al-Jazeera website. For a brief period in 2003, Al-Jazeera\n   searches were three times more popular than searches for sex.\n\n   The desire to find information not given by conventional news sources\n   also drove many of the searches in July and August that made Kobe\n   Bryant the highest-searched male of 2003. During these months, over\n   half of the searches for the Kobe Bryant rape case searched not for\n   Bryant himself but for information about the name and biography of his\n   accuser. These searches demonstrated a major dilemma for high-profile\n   sexual assault cases in the Internet era. With so much information\n   available online, and so little policing of what sites are publishing,\n   no high-profile rape victim can count on remaining anonymous. Major\n   news organizations kept the woman's name and picture private but\n   independent websites and radio talk show hosts revealed this woman's\n   name and stories about her past that may or may not be true. The\n   accuser actually finished the year as the sixth most-searched woman of\n   2003, with more searches than Anna Kournikova (#37), Christina\n   Aguilera (#25), or Madonna, but only one of six searches asked for her\n   by name.\n\n   The end of 2003 has been dominated by celebrity scandals like the\n   Prince Charles rumors (#156), the Michael Jackson (#73) arrest, and,\n   most significantly, the Paris Hilton sex tape. Interest in the\n   debutante party girl had been growing gradually all year, and she\n   finally appeared in the Lycos 50 for the first time in October. But\n   once the homemade video of her having sex with ex-boyfriend Rick\n   Solomon was released on the Internet in November, searches for Hilton\n   exploded. It's just the latest example of how search activity goes\n   sky-high whenever someone we don't expect to see naked appears naked,\n   or is rumored to be naked, on the Internet. During the second week of\n   November, Paris Hilton and the sex tape generated more search activity\n   than all of the search terms from number two through number 15\n   combined.\n\n   On the entertainment front, the significant development of 2003 was a\n   higher-than-usual number of stars who seemingly came out of nowhere to\n   take prominent places in pop culture. Actually, in the case of Clay\n   Aiken (#24), one star literally came out of nowhere. In January, Aiken\n   was a 24-year-old just out of college and working with the mentally\n   disabled in North Carolina. By midsummer, he was one of America's\n   biggest musical superstars thanks to American Idol (#30), and for the\n   year he finishes as the third most-searched male on the Internet\n   behind only Kobe Bryant and rapper 50 Cent (#18) -- another star who\n   never received searches until late 2002.\n\n   What's most astonishing about Aiken's popularity is that his fan base,\n   perceived as consisting of teenage girls, actually consists primarily\n   of women aged 30 to 50. Those teenage girls instead turned their\n   attention in 2003 to two new musical stars, Canadian rocker Avril\n   Lavigne (#51) and sitcom-actress-turned-singer-and-movie-star Hilary\n   Duff (#61). Out-of-nowhere entertainment stars also included the\n   Russian pop group t.A.T.u. (#39) and the goth-rock band Evanescence\n   (#71).\n\n   OTHER BIG BREAKOUTS OF 2003: Pop psychologist Dr. Phil, Atkins\n   competitor The South Beach Diet, Japanese cartoon Inuyasha, maturing\n   teen queens The Olsen Twins, wrestling babe Torrie Wilson, Jamaican\n   dancehall rapper Sean Paul, porn star-turned-politician Mary Carey,\n   rockers Coldplay, jazz-pop chanteuse Norah Jones, and celebrity dirt\n   website The Smoking Gun.\n\n   HOT IN 2002, NOT HOT IN 2003: all file-swapping software except KaZaA,\n   the sex tape scandal of Asian politician Chu Mei-Feng, pop star\n   Shakira, actor Josh Hartnett, Summer Olympics, toy and cartoon Zoids,\n   rock bands Incubus, Blink-182, and System of a Down, Super Bowl\n   commercials, and searches related to the September 11 attacks on\n   America.\n\n   WHERE ARE THEY NOW: If you are looking for tattoos, the term which\n   ranked #3 in 2002 and #4 in 2001, we made an editorial decision in\n   June to retire the term from the Lycos 50 after 200 weeks. The\n   searches had become so constant that tattoos belonged on the list of\n   generic subjects like lyrics and games that we don't include on our\n   weekly list.\n\n   ONES TO WATCH 2004: There hasn't been a movie in years as\n   controversial as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, which is\n   already getting lots of searches... Other hot 2004 films getting\n   searches already include Brad Pitt in Troy, Harry Potter and the\n   Prisoner of Azkaban, and Catwoman, which also should make Halle Berry\n   a summer staple of the Lycos 50... Rock band Nine Inch Nails gets\n   plenty of searches but has never made the Lycos 50; that should change\n   when 2004 brings their first album of new material since 1999... Chad\n   Michael Murray looks like the next hot teen heartthrob... The latest\n   game in the Grand Theft Auto series is scheduled for fall 2004...\n   Since female artists usually get even bigger once they go solo\n   (example: Beyonce), expect big things from No Doubt's Gwen Stefani in\n   2004... A couple of previously unknown athletes become huge stars\n   during each Olympics, and two U.S. names to watch are gymnasts\n   Chellsie Memmel and Carly Patterson... Anti-impotence drug Cialis is\n   hugely popular in Europe and is coming to challenge Viagra in the U.S.\n\n   ONES TO WATCH 2003: Our predictions for 2003 turned out to be quite\n   successful. Daredevil boosted Jennifer Garner to stardom, even though\n   the movie didn't do as well as expected. The Matrix Reloaded and\n   Terminator 3 both made plenty of money. LeBron James went from high\n   school prospect to the NBA player with the most-purchased jersey.\n   Beyonce became a true R&B superstar with her first solo album. On the\n   other hand, computer game Doom III was delayed and never came out, and\n   actor Eric Bana went nowhere as star of The Hulk.\n\n   KEEP WATCHING: That's not all for the Web's Most Wanted awards.

        "articleBody": "Clearinghouse on Early Education and Parenting\n\n\n   Early Childhood Research & Practice (ECRP) is a bilingual Internet\n   journal on the development, care, and education of young children.\n\n   The Clearinghouse on Early Education and Parenting (CEEP) is part of\n   the the Early Childhood and Parenting (ECAP) Collaborative at the\n   University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. CEEP provides publications\n   and information to the worldwide early childhood and parenting\n   communities.\n\n   Grade Configuration in K-12 Schools\n   Nancy McEntire\n   2002 (Last updated May 2005)\n   Many educators and communities are searching for evidence on the best\n   way to provide a high-quality education for their children and to make\n   the best use of their education funds. One area that is of perennial\n   interest is how to best configure the grades in local schools. Public\n   education in the United States provides for kindergarten through grade\n   12 in a variety of grade arrangements, from the K-12 school to\n   separate schools for single grades. Unfortunately, as Paglin and Fager\n   (1997) point out: \"Research has not provided definitive answers to the\n   myriad possible questions about grade span, but the questions have\n   never gone away. They are questions which arise whenever school\n   reform, increasing or declining enrollment, or financial\n   considerations bring about a reorganization of existing schools, the\n   building of new schools, or consolidation of districts\" (p. 2). Much\n   of the research available has been done on rural or middle schools.\n   The research on the \"best\" grade configuration is inconclusive. At\n   best, it indicates factors to be considered in deciding on a school's\n   grade span or a community's configuration of grades within its\n   elementary and secondary school system.\n\n   Contents\n\n     * How do schools differ in grade configuration?\n     * Single-grade-level configurations\n     * Other grade-level configurations: Middle schools, K-12\n     * How do grade configurations affect transitions?\n     * What factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade\n       configuration?\n     * References\n     * Web Resources\n     * ERIC Resources\n\nHow do schools differ in grade configuration?\n\n   Schools in the United States are organized in different ways: some\n   schools include K-3, K-4, K-5, K-6, K-8, K-9, or K-12; others are\n   organized as middle schools, junior high schools, and senior high\n   schools; and still others consist of students in just one grade, such\n   as a kindergarten center or a ninth-grade center. Some schools include\n   pre-kindergarten. The U.S. Department of Education's National Center\n   for Education Statistics (2002) provides data on the number of regular\n   public school districts providing instruction and the percentage of\n   students in membership, by grade span and by state, for the school\n   year 2000-2001.\n\nSingle-grade-level configurations\n\n   The literature suggests that some school districts have found\n   advantages to schools that contain students at one grade level,\n   although these advantages are not necessarily supported by research\n   (Reents, 2002):\n     * A single-grade center, such as a school only for ninth-graders,\n       can develop programs specific to the needs of that age group.\n     * Siphoning off students from several schools can relieve\n       overcrowding at those schools.\n     * Students may be able to participate on an equal level in more\n       activities and be less influenced by older students.\n     * The greater number of students in single-grade centers may enable\n       the school to increase course offerings.\n\n   The literature also suggests some possible disadvantages to separate\n   single-grade configurations (Hopkins, 1997):\n     * The cost and length of student travel increases, particularly in a\n       school district that covers a large area.\n     * Parent involvement may decrease, possibly affected by the distance\n       to the school and the number of schools a family's children\n       attend.\n     * Students are required to make an increased number of school\n       transitions.\n     * Fewer opportunities are provided for interaction between age\n       groups.\n\n   Hopkins (1997) also suggests some additional factors for school\n   districts to consider:\n     * Combining schools into separate grade centers may affect whether\n       neighborhood schools close or remain open.\n     * Current buildings may have a design more suitable for several\n       grade levels.\n     * School population may increase or decrease substantially as\n       configurations change.\n\nOther grade-level configurations: Middle schools, K-12\n\n   \"Much of what has happened with regards to school grade structure can\n   be attributed to the development of the middle school\" (Franklin &\n   Glascock, 1996, p. 4). The separation of students in grades 5 or 6 to\n   7 or 8 in middle schools is justified by some school districts because\n   districts believe that middle schools better meet the developmental\n   needs of preadolescents. As Howley (2002) points out, the\n   developmental needs of young adolescents differ from those of\n   elementary school children and older teenagers. \"Developmentally\n   responsive middle schools must take into account all that is known\n   about young adolescents and the cultural context in which they live\"\n   (Lounsbury, 1996). The number of middle schools increased by 35% from\n   1967 to 2000.\n\n   In the past decade, researchers also have demonstrated renewed\n   interest in schools that include grades kindergarten through 12. A\n   study of rural schools that examined the relationship between grade\n   configuration and student achievement in Louisiana found that students\n   in K-12 rural schools did as well or better on achievement tests as\n   students in separate elementary, middle, or high schools. Students in\n   high poverty areas also did better in the K-12 schools (Franklin &\n   Glascock, 1996). A similar study in Texas analyzed data from a study\n   of 1001 Texas high schools, including 116 K-12 schools. This study\n   produced similar results (Bickel, Howley, Williams, & Glascock, 2000).\n\nHow do grade configurations affect transitions?\n\n   The division of elementary schools into configurations that include\n   fewer grades requires that students make several transitions from one\n   school to another. Researchers note that transitions can be stressful\n   for students:\n     * Alspaugh (1999) found a significant achievement loss during each\n       transition year. He also found that some students regain what is\n       lost in the following year, but it would seem that students who\n       make fewer transitions need fewer years to make up for achievement\n       losses caused by transitions.\n     * Another study found that each time students switched schools,\n       their feelings of anonymity increased. Researchers who found that\n       sixth-grade students in both elementary and combination K-12\n       schools outperformed students in middle schools or junior high\n       schools considered the number of transitions a significant factor.\n       This study considered 8 schools with 7 different grade spans with\n       student populations of 82 to 1,200. The schools were located in\n       both urban and rural settings in 5 northwest states. The number of\n       grades in the schools ranged from 1 to 11 (Paglin & Fager, 1997).\n     * Another research study found that girls in early adolescence\n       suffered from a drop in self-esteem, extracurricular\n       participation, and leadership behaviors when they made the\n       transition into middle school or junior high, but not if they\n       remained in an elementary school setting. This study found that\n       the effects of this transition lingered throughout the school\n       years. For boys, the study found similar negative effects in\n       extracurricular participation and grades, but not in self-esteem,\n       when they made the transition into middle school or junior high.\n       The authors concluded that the relatively protected elementary\n       school setting made the entry into adolescence less stressful for\n       both boys and girls. The students who had not had the stress of\n       the earlier transition seemed to cope better with the transition\n       into high school than did other students (Simmons & Blyth, 1987).\n     * Franklin and Glascock (1996) found that sixth-grade boys\n       experienced more suspensions in middle schools or junior high\n       schools than in elementary schools, possibly related to the\n       effects of the transition, the school organization, or school\n       size. This study was based on information gathered from all\n       Louisiana public schools during the 1992-1993 school year.\n\nWhat factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade\nconfiguration?\n\n   Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory looked at\n   eight schools with seven different grade spans. They examined the\n   history of each school's decision on grade configuration along with\n   observed advantages and disadvantages of each configuration and\n   principals' comments on the success of their programs (Paglin & Fager,\n   1997). Based on this research, Paglin and Fager compiled a list of\n   nine factors that school districts might want to consider when making\n   decisions about grade configurations of individual schools:\n     * the cost and length of student travel, particularly in a school\n       district that covers a large area\n     * a possible increase or decrease in parent involvement, possibly\n       affected by the distance to the school and the number of schools a\n       family's children attend\n     * the number of students at each grade level, which may affect class\n       groupings and courses offered\n     * the effect of school setting on achievement, particularly for\n       grades 6-9\n     * effect on whether the neighborhood schools close or remain open\n     * the number of school transitions for students\n     * the opportunities for interaction between age groups\n     * the influence of older students on younger students\n     * the building design-is it suitable for only a few or for several\n       grade levels?\n\n   Paglin and Fager concluded that designing a school system to use a\n   particular span of grades in individual schools will not in itself\n   guarantee that students will learn well and be well adjusted.\n\nReferences\n\n   Alspaugh, John W.

Since this\n   study was limited to a single school district that included all four\n   elementary school configurations in communities that were found to be\n   similar, variables that historically confuse the application of\n   results to conclusions were systematically eliminated as causal\n   factors. To study the effect of the remaining variables on student\n   outcome, educational instructors that had experience teaching in both\n   a K-2 and other configurations within the district were surveyed. The\n   survey findings revealed the magnitude of the variance between causal\n   agents known to affect future student success that exists in the K-2\n   versus other configuration elementary schools. In order of decreasing\n   magnitude, the following variables are more prevalent in the K-2\n   environment than in other configurations, and their increased presence\n   related to superior student achievement in later years: Resources,\n   Parental Involvement, Collaboration (among administrators, teachers,\n   and special services personnel), Foundation (ability to establish\n   social and emotional competence, language, cognition, teaching\n   strategies that lead to next levels of accomplishment), Relevant\n   Teacher Training, Teacher Efficacy (with regard to aligning primary\n   students' interests and abilities), High Expectations, Principal's\n   Leadership, Teacher's Stability, and School Climate.

A traditionally strong argument against smaller\n   schools, however, is that they are too expensive. Large consolidated\n   schools with narrowly specialized grade spans are typically offered as\n   necessary to save money and to meet the needs of different age groups.\n   This paper examines whether the size-by-socioeconomic status\n   interaction effect proves robust across alternative regression model\n   specifications, as it did across different states. It also explores\n   whether the equity gains associated with smaller schools are\n   incompatible with the need to save money. Analysis with four different\n   regression model specifications consistently found that increased\n   school size was related to increases in achievement-test-score costs\n   associated with economically disadvantaged students. School size was\n   negatively related to expenditure per pupil, but this relationship\n   became increasingly tenuous as size increased, and eventually savings\n   became negligible. In addition, organizational factors, especially as\n   manifest in the distinctive components of the single-unit school, were\n   related to cost reduction. For those interested in balancing\n   expenditure per pupil with achievement-based equity, the best\n   grade-span configuration seems to be a small single-unit school.\n   (Contains 76 references.)

The\n   larger the number of less advantaged students attending a school, the\n   greater the decline. This study also examined the claim that large\n   schools with a narrow range of grades necessarily save money by\n   achieving economies of scale. Results indicate that school size was\n   negatively related to costs, but this relationship became increasingly\n   tenuous as school size increased, with savings eventually becoming\n   negligible. In addition, analysis of organizational factors distinct\n   to the single-unit school indicates that if schools are designed\n   solely to minimize expenditure per pupil, the best configuration may\n   be a large single-unit school. However, if expenditure per pupil is\n   balanced with achievement-based equity, the best configuration seems\n   to be one small single-unit school per district. While decreased size\n   would increase costs, the fact that there is only one school with\n   13-15 grade levels would substantially diminish costs. (Contains 69\n   references.)

The booklet examines questions\n   relating to grade configurations, its purpose being to increase\n   awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding grade span. It\n   explores the ways that schools have addressed concerns associated with\n   particular grade spans and suggests avenues for further inquiry. The\n   text focuses on historical trends in grade configuration and the\n   various contexts of grade spans, such as whether a school is in a\n   rural or an urban area. Most research on grade span focuses on the\n   middle grades and addresses such questions as: Which grades should be\n   grouped together in one school? How many grades should be in one\n   school? and How many school transitions will students make during the\n   K-12 years? Some tips for starting a school with a grade span new to a\n   school system are offered, followed by an overview of grade-span\n   considerations. The bulk of the volume describes eight schools'\n   experiences with grade spans, discussing such issues as how the grade\n   span came about and how the schools were structured to meet the needs\n   of the particular grades it contains.

Of the 706\n   districts operating unit schools, 157 districts in 27 states responded\n   to the survey. The majority of respondents (106) were superintendents\n   of one-school districts, that is, districts in which the K-12 unit\n   school was the only school. Of the 53 multischool districts, about\n   half operated just one K-12 unit school. Data reveal that K-12 unit\n   schools were usually located in an agricultural region where\n   socioeconomic status was lower than the national average; the average\n   unit school enrollment was 414; most unit schools in multischool\n   districts were comparatively remote from key resources such as\n   hospitals, interstate highways, and cities; superintendents of\n   single-school districts reported higher rates of above-average test\n   scores, postsecondary attendance, and high school completion than did\n   superintendents of multischool districts; satellite and Internet\n   systems were the most prevalent forms of distance learning\n   technologies in use; community attitudes toward single-school\n   districts were moderately and positively related to the sustainability\n   of the school; single-school districts spent almost 50 percent more\n   per pupil than multischool districts; and single-school districts more\n   often than multischool districts employed cooperative strategies for\n   maximizing resources such as joining regional service agencies or\n   cooperating with other districts.

Middle school advocates focus\n   on early adolescents' need for developmentally appropriate\n   institutions, but show only a weak historical understanding of the\n   emergence and status of middle schools. Critical factors in early\n   support for the middle school movement included urban interests in\n   countering de facto school segregation without use of busing, urban\n   overcrowding of elementary and high schools, and a \"bandwagon\n   effect\"--the desire to appear modern and reform oriented. The\n   emergence of rural middle schools under the cloak of psychological\n   progress can be destructive to both the declining sense of community\n   in America, and to the actual persistence of many rural communities\n   still organized around K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools.\n   Examination of the National Center for Education Statistics's Common\n   Core of Data indicates that the construction of rural middle schools\n   has led to the closing and consolidation of rural elementary schools.\n   During the school years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that\n   were middle schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged\n   in suburban areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same\n   time, the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined\n   precipitously. Emerging school reform agendas that provide\n   alternatives to the \"inevitability\" of consolidation include efforts\n   to restructure schools as caring communities (requiring active parent\n   and community participation), and the development of rural schools as\n   centers for integrated social services.

The organization of the\n   middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based on a\n   philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet the\n   special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate\n   unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary\n   and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one or\n   the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a \"failed\"\n   promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation\n   of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number of new\n   middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively\n   increased. A review of research on middle-level education indicates\n   that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by\n   attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact on\n   middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms \"junior\n   high school\" and \"middle school\" do not define a school's program.\n   Additionally, the effective schools research has given rise to\n   discriminant analyses of effective middle school variables and allowed\n   researchers to identify those characteristics most commonly found\n   within \"exemplary\" middle schools.

Although the\n   K-2, 3-5 structure is often implemented in response to declining\n   enrollment, other educational benefits cited may include better\n   concentration on the educational and psychological needs of children\n   in the two age groups, though one research study showed no significant\n   differences in student achievement, attitude toward school,\n   extracurricular participation, or career aspiration. The goals of the\n   South Allegheny reorganization (in response to declining enrollment)\n   were to equalize class sizes to facilitate multilevel instruction in\n   reading and math, and to make better use of staff, school buildings,\n   and instructional resources. Each of these objectives is described in\n   detail, along with perceived disadvantages. An evaluative report\n   revealed that the new grade structure saved money and resulted in\n   improved discipline, student attitudes, and student interaction.\n   Finally, literature on the implementation process is briefly reviewed,\n   emphasizing the need for clear articulation between grade levels.\n   Notes and references are included.

        "articleBody": " Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith post-release\n   discussion\n  Ahoatam\n   05-06-2005, 05:28 PM\n   Planned, foreseen, whatever. The point is, I knew the minute that Shmi\n   talked about the circumstances of Anakin's birth that he was\n   \"planned,\" and that meant to me that it was meant for him to\n   eventually become Darth Vader. I mean, D'uh!\n   SINCE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS.\n   Ask George Lucas this: \"George, did you mean for Anakin to become\n   Darth Vader, and that the Sith were involved in his creation? Did you\n   intend for Palpatine, who becomes Emperor, to be the driving force (by\n   way of what he learned from his own master) behind the creation of\n   Anakin/Vader?\n   Let me guess . . . the answer would be . . . \"YES.\"\n   Okay, I've been hanging around here for a couple of months, as well as\n   anxiously awaiting this movie to see if the series can be redeemed.\n   I've finally decided to break my silence and speak up and call\n   \"bullshit\" on this.\n   There's no \"well 'duh!\" moment, Jim. You may have assumed that GL was\n   going to head that way with the story, but you never knew, and neither\n   did we. Technically, with what we've been told in this thread about\n   ROTS, we can still only make an assumption. You have no call talking\n   down to someone about a couple lines in TPM because the only thing\n   those lines imply is immaculate conception.\n   As far as your ask GL question, it's irrelevant to the subject. The\n   subject is whether or not one can infer from Episodes 1 and 2 if\n   Anakin was definitely created via Palpatine. And the answer is \"no.\"\n   One can certainly hypothesize this - hell, the morons over at\n   TheForce.net have been arguing this possibility for years. But even\n   the rapid fanboy repeat viewer can't extrapolate your assumptions\n   about the storyline from the material presented in Episodes 1 and 2.\n   All you can do is guess at the possibilities until the text gives you\n   an answer.\n   For what it's worth, I also appreciate this plot turn - it rings truer\n   to the machinations of Palpatine than the will of microscopic life\n   forms.\nBailey\njabba there's a difference between guessing that plot revelation and\n   it having been previously cemented in the text. there was all kinds of\n   speculation as to the nature of the immaculate conception, but there\n   was nothing in episodes 1 or 2 that indicated palpatine had to be\n   behind it. I mean, you might as well reason since he talks so much\n   about \"planning\" and \"forseeing\" that he was behind lando losing the\n   falcon to han in a game of intergalactic texas hold 'em. it was a\n   possibility, sure, but it was left open until now.\nSamurai Mike\n   I find the idea that Palpatine is Anakins father one of the most\n   unimaginative and mind-bogglingly unoriginal plot contrivances in\n   movie history. Lucas came up with THAT in 20 years?!\n   But I digress, can anyone give me a good rating of the lightsaber\n   duels? Is it really just a case of quantity over quality, or were you\n   just expecting a bit too much? There are supposed to be 5 duels in\n   this film, but they've barely warranted a mention so far. Are they\n   really that bad?\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   Yeah, call bullshit. I am sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The\n   REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the\n   birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the\n   creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen.\n   I cannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this\n   coming. I fucking saw it coming, and I have discussed this ad nauseum\n   with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it\n   is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are,\n   apparently, more intuitive than others. I can't help it that this is\n   so.\nCharlie Brigden\n   Did Palpatine name me Sean too?\ndevincf\n   I think the duels are fairly lifeless most of the time, and The Duel\n   is a major disappointment.\n   BTW, I think it's interesting that people here are saying my take is\n   negative. I am definitely more positive than negative on the film, and\n   my review at rottentomatoes will be fresh rated. But Episode III is a\n   pretty mediocre movie, and it fizzles more than it sizzles - and\n   frankly, Episode III needed to be the one to hit it out of the\n   ballpark. As a generic action film it's OK, as the most important\n   episode of the PT it's a bummer.\ngravedigger\n   Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean\n   ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about\n   Palpatine being Anakin's old man.\nWaker\n   Yea I don't see where anybody'd get the impression that you hated the\n   film, besides of course your several posts happily bashing it.\n   And Fatboy is a douche, if only because he goes over the top about\n   everything he ever writes about or discusses, and has no\n   self-awareness; he's wound up leaving, dramatically, every board on\n   the internet, and critiquing them at length on the next board he\n   wanders to. But that doesn't necessarily invalidate his points.\nSamurai Mike\n   Man that sucks, after the cool but way too short duels in AOTC. So\n   what IS good?\ndevincf\n   McGregor is good. The scene at the ballet, minus the whole thing about\n   Palpy making Anakin, is good. The slaughter at the Jedi temple is\n   good. Obi Wan leaving Anakin to die is good.\n   The back and forth plotting between Palpatine and the Jedi Council\n   (each is trying to use Anakin against the other) would be GREAT if it\n   happened in more than two back to back scenes. That should have been\n   the main plot of the movie, with Anakin increasingly torn.\ncognizant\n   Noob question: Why would Palpatine 'create' someone powerful enough to\n   beat him? He looked pretty comfortable using Maul, Dooku, etc, aways\n   staying on top.\ndevincf\n   I think it's a good question. I guess he thought he could control\n   Vader?\n   The other question is: how does Vader go from being the right hand man\n   of Palpatine in III to Tarkin's bitch in IV?\nRuss Fischer\n   He fell in with a bad crowd....Chewbacca.\ncognizant\n   I think it's a good question. I guess he thought he could control\n   Vader?\n   We could stretch it and hypothesize that Palpatine's masterplan was to\n   create and then ensure the Skywalker line would continue and he would\n   use each member like lapdogs for his nefarious schemes (because he's a\n   lazy bastard or something), first Anakin, then his son Luke, and so on\n   forever, but this plan (ludicrous as it sounds) is shot to shit from\n   the beginning because of Anakin's duel with Obi 1 which leaves him\n   more machine than man.\n   Or something equally contrived.\nCharlie Brigden\n   I guess Palpatine was so overconfident in his powers of control that\n   he though no apprentice would ever try to overthrow him, even with the\n   Sith's history. Maybe he saw himself as the ultimate Sith Lord, and\n   after Vader decided he wouldn't need any more to do his bidding, but\n   didn't think what had gone on in the past with Sith overthrowing Sith\n   would ever happen to him.\n   I always saw Vader as a kind of advisor. Tarkin was the main military\n   commander, and Vader was always just there in the background to\n   represent the Emperor. A kind of Sith Advisor I guess.\nRuss Fischer\n   That's the problem with foreseeing things. Unlike Jim, most seers\n   can't actually see how everything is going to work out. Palpatine\n   could control Vader easily -- that's the great thing about\n   conditioning someone with hate and loss.\n   Vader was supposed to kill Yoda and Kenobi. With their deaths, Padme\n   and the kids might not have lived, or the children could have been\n   raised as Sith. (Like Jordan, Minnesota for dark jedi.) If Vader\n   hadn't failed to kill those two jedi, none of the OT would happen, and\n   Palpatine and Vader would still be steering the ship.\nLitmus Configuration\n   Hmmm. I used to like Fatboy. Now he's proven himself to be both a\n   coward and a liar. A shame he went off the deep end and started\n   fabricating all sorts of nonsense regarding people's honest opinions.\n   Oh well.\n   Frankly, I think my opinion of EP3 has been pretty balanced, pointing\n   out the good and the bad. And compared to how I feel about EPs 1 and\n   2, I feel my overall opinions about EP3 are downright positive. I\n   guess everything either has to be a \"masterpiece\" or a \"failure\" for\n   most people these days.\nDarth Chocula\n   How is Jimmy Smits in this as Organa? Thats the only thing I can think\n   of that wasn't covered here...\nAhoatam\n   \"Well, D'uh!\"\nSamurai Mike\n   What did you think of Eps 1 and 2 when you first saw them? I ask\n   because a lot of people (like me) liked them first up, then saw\n   through the eye candy soon after. I guess I'm asking you if you think\n   you're current opinion on Ep 3 will change?\n   I don't know quite what to make of the opinions here. Most of the\n   reviewers seem to be more interested in pointing out whats wrong with\n   it, then saying \"but I think overall I like it\". I'm so confused! (Not\n   difficult to achieve).\nseantree\njust to clear up the Palpatine fathering Anakin deal. I'm glad that\n   was not true as it would have ruined the saga for me.\nLitmus Configuration\n   I strongly disliked both EPs 1 and 2 right out of the gate...but in\n   different ways. My hatred of EP1 was very confusing because I had been\n   such a die-hard STAR WARS fan for so many years. It took me a while to\n   fully reconcile my disappointment. I had no such hesitation with EP2.\n   EP3 is a different animal. The more I think about it, the more\n   questions I end up asking. Unfortunately, I'm not finding satisfying\n   answers. But still, I consider it a significant improvement over EPs 1\n   and 2, and for that, I remain somewhat grateful that at least one of\n   the Prequels wasn't a total failure.\nCanned Food\n   Although I haven't seen the movie yet, I noticed some of you guys were\n   speculating on \"what ifs?,\" such as \"what if Anakin had killed Obi Wan\n   Kenobi.\"\n   It's interesting to see how the future shifts dramatically throughout\n   episode III, causing people to wonder how things could have been if\n   they had not transpired as they did in the film:\n   Anakin and Padme were gonna retire to Naboo after their secret got out\n   and both were expelled from their homes.\n   Then, Anakin converted to the Sith, and things were going to be that\n   the Jedi would be extinguished, Palpatine would be killed by\n   Anakin/Vader, and Padme would sit as his side as the new Imperial\n   family in the galaxy. Kinda neat to imagine how their kids would have\n   been like had they been raised as Sith.\nAndre Dellamorte\n   Fatboy's argument wouldn't hold up in court. Sidious is a liar, and\n   evil. But... that said, who's to say that he's lying?\ndevincf\n   Fatboy is simply full of shit on that point. On both points, probably.\n   Has he seen the movie? Because the way that Palpatine talks about\n   it... anyway, ANakin shows no reaction to the creating life thing.\n   Weak seduction.\ndevincf\n   And frankly, these films are not so subtle that he would be lying\n   about that (after leaving the immaculate conception door open from I)\n   without us being told.\nRuss Fischer\n   From my perspective, it doesn't matter.\n   Immaculate/Jesus Anakin is terrible.\n   Created Anakin is terrible.\n   And what of the midichlorians? Using the Jesus example (as in the\n   thread) they don't fit. Midichlorians weren't necessary to create\n   Jesus. Granted, they're another very stupid idea, but an idea that\n   doesn't fit well with the Jesus theory nonetheless.\nGraham\n   It's important to be totally honest here...I watched this (TPM) in\n   Leicester Square(sp) and paid out a shitload of cash to 'enjoy'\n   it...the enjoyment lasted 'til I hit sunlight,,,(AOTC) was in a\n   similar but not so expensive venue...as for where I'll see ROTS, I'll\n   see where I take myself......\nseantree\n   could be. I'll have to wait until I see it on the 19th to be sure.\n   But, would Lucas throw that line in there and never mention it again\n   if it were true? Some of the arguements mad ein that thread and the\n   one at theforce.net are valid. Such as, If Palpatine could create\n   force sensitive children why not build an entire army of them? The\n   fact that anakin was worried over Padme's death would be a great\n   reason for Palp's to lie about this power also. On the other hand it\n   would be a great blow to the Jedi. I mean finding out that your\n   prophecy had been fulfilled by genetic enhancement? Makes all of their\n   beliefs go down the tubes.\nSamurai Mike\n   I'm glad to hear Ewan is finally getting a chance to shine here (well\n   I hope so). Compared with the first two films, what would you rate\n   Obi-wans 'kickass factor' in this one? With say TPM being a 7 (cool\n   Maul fight, little else), and a 3 for AOTC (generally clueless,\n   unsatisfying fights, needs kids to help him etc.)\n   Also, what amount of time does he have onscreen?\ndevincf\n   He didn't create an army because it probably isn't easy. He may have\n   needed to have found the right person.\n   Lucas never mentioning the line again is what shows that it's true.\n   Also, how many times does Palpatine really lie to Anakin?\nAhoatam\n   Actually, I have to agree with Fischer on this one. While I prefer the\n   Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like\n   having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved\n   under your fingernails. I happen to be a fingernail guy, because I\n   like my nuts.\n   I saw early drafts of TPM script in which Anakin's father was a krayt\n   dragon hunter on Tatooine. It would have worked just fine if Anakin's\n   father was some long-dead hero, which would satisfy both needs: Anakin\n   having the burden of high expectations because of his lineage, and the\n   want of a father-figure, which Obi and Palpatine jockey to replace.\nSamurai Mike\n   It's important to be totally honest here...I watched this (TPM) in\n   Leicester Square(sp) and paid out a shitload of cash to 'enjoy'\n   it...the enjoyment lasted 'til I hit sunlight,,,(AOTC) was in a\n   similar but not so expensive venue...as for where I'll see ROTS, I'll\n   see where I take myself......\n   You want honesty? I really liked TPM when it came out. There were\n   reasons for this:\n    I was young and naive.\n    I was not the jaded moviegoer I am today.\n    Most importantly, I had never been near an internet messageboard in\n   my life.\n   Over the years I came to see it for the soulless toy commercial it is,\n   but for a while there I DID like it, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.\n   AOTC I liked the first time, got caught up in it, cheered when Yoda\n   got his groove on. However, by the second showing I was over it, too\n   many crap scenes to forgive, and it seemed the characters had\n   regressed (Obi-wan and Padme, I'm looking at YOU). I haven't watched\n   it at all since its theatrical run (except for a crappy vcd copy I\n   borrowed from a friend that had hilarious subtitles. \"The Jedi will be\n   finished, fella!\":)\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean\n   ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about\n   Palpatine being Anakin's old man.\n   I don't think I was guessing. It was my take on things once Shmi\n   started talking about the circumstances of Anakin's birth. I mean, it\n   wasn't just coincidence that Qui Gon ended up on Tatooine, it wasn't\n   just coincidence that he met Anakin there. It was part of Palpatine's\n   plan, or that is what I thought. That was how I took it at the time.\n   After all, doesn't Yoda say later to \"not underestimate the powers of\n   the Emperor?\" I took that line from Ep. 6 and applied that logically\n   to what happens in the PT. I was wrong about one thing I considered,\n   that Qui Gon was secretly a Sith, so I'm not that good of a guesser.\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   Actually, I have to agree with Fischer on this one. While I prefer the\n   Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like\n   having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved\n   under your fingernails.

It could also be considered that the\n   midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow\n   manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to\n   the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated\n   the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. I know\n   I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not\n   they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some\n   level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars\n   cartoons, or the live action series he's planning.\ngl2899\n   SPOILERS\n   This film has a higher number of laugh out loud moments than the other\n   two. Sadly, they are all in the more intense and emotional scenes.\n   Lucas seems to be emotionally tone deaf.\n   The movie ended up being what I expected: reasonable eye candy with a\n   groaner of a story. It's full of fairly ridiculous stuff:\n   The Emperor is a joke (although Palpatine at the opera/ballet is\n   great)\n   Lucas should have stopped having old men fight\n   Mace vs Sidious is one of the worst fight scenes ever\n   The Duel is a huge disappointment. It's actually sort of boring and\n   has none of the emotional heaviness of the one at the end of JEDI.\n   The opening rescue sequence is like the Jedi Knight Follies\n   Lucas insists on crowding his frame in every fight scene. There's no\n   emotional component to any of this stuff.\n   Padme's death is frankly ludicrous\n   So is Vader as Frankenstein\n   Vader cries. Twice.\n   General Grievous is a villain who belongs in a spoof. At one point he\n   wrings his hands because i guess he has no mustache to twirl\n   There is some good stuff:\n   McGregor, once the movie picks up steam\n   There are a couple of choice shots, including SPOILER the one where\n   Vader goes to kill the younglings END SPOILER\n   Either the effects shots are much better this time than AOTC or I'm\n   just really used to digital stunt men.\n   Well, sounds like they stuck to the [bleep]ing script.\n   Padme dies of a [bleep]ing broken heart?\n   Anakin is more whiny psycho than galactic badass?\n   General Grievous is Snidely Whiplash in a tin suit?\n   Yeah, the people that said that the leaked script wasn't indicative of\n   what was to come were wrong.\n   Thats as believable as Anakin as Christ.\n   Shouldn't have bought into the hype.\n   Shame on my thrice.\n   I hope some people can enjoy it though. My nephew is going to love it.\n   Seeing him enjoy this movie will be worth it to me. But I am just not\n   the target audience for Star Wars anymore.\n   *edited because I swear too much*\nBailey\n   Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't\n   Anakin who is \"the one\" it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come\n   from any virgin birth. It could also be considered that the\n   midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow\n   manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to\n   the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated\n   the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. I know\n   I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not\n   they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some\n   level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars\n   cartoons, or the live action series he's planning.\n   or maybe lucas just didn't know exactly how it was going to play out\n   either-- and during the course of writing it he painted himself into\n   some corners that were resolved less than satisfactorily. it happens\n   in single screenplays all the time, let alone a story that takes place\n   over six. that wouldn't be the worst of the PT's faults. whether\n   palpatine helped to conceive anakin or not, it's still contrived. I\n   don't see why palpatine helping would make it less so, as it just adds\n   another level to it (and takes more of the human element out of\n   anakin's failure not to mention further complicates the \"prophecy\".) I\n   think if it's only a single line in the movie then fatboy's\n   interpretation is still a possibility, at least for those of us who\n   may want to willfully ignore the added twist. I don't mind ambiguity-\n   but to detail the whole midichlorian\\immaculate conception\\prophecy\n   thing and still leave it ambiguous seems really dumb.\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   GL knew exactly how it was going to play out. He's had this whole\n   vision in his head for many years.\n   Also, I think maybe many of us are taking all of this way too\n   seriously. Star Wars is a movie series, that is all that it is. It is\n   popular entertainment, not something that is going to get food into\n   the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet. We need to\n   maintain perspective here.\nTimmay\n   \"Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it\n   wasn't Anakin who is \"the one\" it is actually his son, Luke, who did\n   not come from any virgin birth.\"\n   But it wasn't Luke that killed the emperor, it was Anakin, hence\n   destoying the Dark Side and such.\n   I just had to chime in at least once on this. Personally, I tried to\n   not get too excited about this last episode, but as a 27 year old with\n   older brothers who grew up with Star Wars toys all around me and\n   having Return of the Jedi as my seminal movie event of my childhood\n   it's impossible.

The circle is now complete; when I left you, I was but\n   the learner, now I am the master.\n   And now the people who've watched The Duel aren't even mentioning it\n   as one of the high points of the film, as particularly emotional or\n   even memorable.

It's really pretty simple...Lucas had the pick of many\n   excellent story ideas and every conceivable technical resource at his\n   disposal to ensure thoughtful, well crafted movies.

Now does the fact that Lucas took it out mean he threw out\n   the idea completely to go with the immaculate conception/Chosen One\n   idea, or did he just not want to spell out Palpatine's hand in\n   Anakin's creation and leave it up to the audience to make the\n   connection?\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   Actually, the story of Star Wars has changed constantly since 1977.\n   The prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along.\n   He may have had the vaguest outline in mind, but the \"whole thing\" has\n   not been in his head for years at all.\n   So why do you write about movies and not the poor and starving of this\n   planet?\n   And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of\n   things that were made up as they went along?

The\n   REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the\n   birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the\n   creation of Darth Vader.

Sure, certain details had to\n   be, by necessity, \"on the fly,\" but the overall story line has been in\n   his head for many years.\n   From what I've seen from both fansites and official materials, like\n   Bouzereau's Annotated Screenplays, the \"overall storyline\" has changed\n   so much over the years that the final version is virtually\n   unrecognizable from the original conception.\n   Answer me this: Why is it essential for fans to maintain the myth that\n   Lucas planned everything out in advance back in 1974? Film, unlike\n   books, is a medium based on contingency. Stuff is always going to be\n   going in and out of a movie based on the availability of performers,\n   the amount of money involved, and totally random events. On top of\n   that, some ideas just become unworkable or silly or just plain bad\n   over time. I'm sure that Lucas had a much bigger role planned for Jar\n   Jar over the course of the prequels, but minimized his presence when\n   it became apparent that everyone --EVERYONE!-- hated the shit out of\n   the character, and not just rabid fanboys and movie critics.\n   There's no shame in enjoying an epic saga, even if the author was just\n   making it up as he or she went along. What matters is that the author\n   maintains a certain level of quality and consistency over the course\n   of the story-- i.e., \"as long as it's good.\" Insisting on a single\n   unifying vision, especially as it pertains to characters like Boba\n   Fett, Maul, and Grevious --all more the products of toy licensing\n   conferences than some grand Joseph Campbell mythopoeic crap-- suggests\n   an inability to enjoy the movies for what they are. Or maybe you\n   aren't enjoying them all that much to begin with? Search your\n   feelings, you know this to be true...\n   Besides, as everyone knows by now, Lucas swiped the plot and\n   characters from Jack Kirby's New Gods comics and the Kinks' Part 1\n   Lola Versus Powerman and the Money-Go-Round.\nLitmus Configuration\n   You have to give props to Lucas, he is the greatest spin doctor and\n   marketing genius of all time.\n   Absolutely 100% correct. (Well, aside from certain dictators\n   throughout history.)\n   I guess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago,\n   he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films,\n   then 9 films again, then 6 films. And yet he did. He said in\n   interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives\n   JEDI. So much for that story. It wasn't until 1996 that Lucas first\n   publicly stated that the whole Saga would be comprised of only six\n   films, nearly 20 years after the first film hit screens and became a\n   global pop culture phenomenon (contrary to apologists trying to\n   downplay the impact of STAR WARS in order to make the lackluster\n   Prequels look better in comparison.)\n   I don't believe a damn thing Lucas or his cronies say anymore. I can\n   only look at his work and judge it on its own merits.\nLitmus Configuration\n   Great post, Louie!\nJim Pappas/Jabba\n   I can't understand how any of you believe that George Lucas \"made up\"\n   the plots of the PT as he went along.

If some of you want to think what it is you\n   think, don't let me try and convince you otherwise.\n   Actually, I could swear that I just read an interview in which Lucas\n   said that most of the prequel trilogy was \"filler,\" and that Ep. III\n   was the real \"meat\" of the PT. In other words, most of the events in\n   Eps. I and II were just a means of killing time before Anakin's\n   fateful lava slalom.\n   Believe what you want. I think Lucas had the idea of doing a big outer\n   space adventure in his head back in the '70s, but that was about as\n   specific as it got. He narrowed down his focus by reading SF novels\n   and Marvel Comics, and possibly Joseph Campbell as well, but probably\n   more Castaneda. I suspect the theme of kids redeeming the father\n   probably didn't occur to him until well in the pre-production of\n   Empire, and I seriously doubt Leia was even going to be a blood\n   relation until sometime between Empire and Jedi, regardless of the\n   rumors about Fisher wanting a bigger role. In short, most of the\n   transcendent themes were things Lucas came up with after 1977 and\n   applied retroactively to the saga through the magic of filmmaking and\n   the gullibility of fans who couldn't accept that he'd improvised most\n   of the storyline.\n   Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth\n   Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central character of the\n   entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and\n   is never seen or mentioned again.\nMiasta\n   Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth\n   Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central character of the\n   entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and\n   is never seen or mentioned again.\n   Wouldn't it be cool if Lucas let some ILM underlings or intern types\n   at Lucas film, who have been waiting in the wings, getting coffee and\n   stuff for the senior artist for years, have a go at doing an animated\n   version of the first draft of Star Wars just for a goof?

After reportedly offering up a\n   mixed review of The Phantom Menace, Kurtz shared the original plans\n   for all nine episodes of the Star Wars saga circa 1980, according to\n   TheForce.net. When Lucas changed course with Return of the Jedi, Kurtz\n   opted to leave the Star Wars saga and produce The Dark Crystal with\n   Jim Henson. What follows is the fan site's description of what Kurtz\n   allegedly relayed (no doubt to a room full of stunned Star Wars fans),\n   and a very cool glimpse into what might have been:\n   EPISODE 1: Was to focus on the origins of\n   the Jedi Knights and how they are initiated and\n   trained.\n   EPISODE 2: Introduction and development of\n   Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n   EPISODE 3: Introduction and life of Vader.\n   EPISODE 4: There were seven different drafts\n   of the film. At one point, they pursued buying\n   the rights to Hidden Fortress because of the\n   strong similarities. At one point, Luke was a\n   female, Han was Luke's brother, Luke's father\n   was the one in prison (interesting point for\n   some debates) and the film featured 40\n   wookies.\n   EPISODE 5: Once written, the screenplay of\n   Empire is almost exactly what is seen on\n   screen. The only cut scenes were those\n   involving wampas in the rebel base (cut\n   because of time and unsolved technical\n   glitches) and about two minutes of Luke/Yoda\n   Jedi training with no real dialog.\n   EPISODE 6: Leia was to be elected \"Queen of\n   her people\" leaving her isolated. Han was to\n   die. Luke confronted Vader and went on with\n   his life alone. Leia was not to be Luke's sister.\n   EPISODE 7: Third trilogy was to focus on\n   Luke's life as a Jedi, with very few details\n   planned out.\n   EPISODE 8: Luke's sister (not Leia) appears\n   from another part of the galaxy.\n   EPISODE 9: First appearance of the Emperor.\n   And then there's this passage in the 1980 work Once Upon A Galaxy: A\n   Journal of The Making of Empire Strikes Back, by Alan Arnold (pp.\n   247-48):\n   Alan Arnold: Tell me more about the overall concept of the Star Wars\n   saga.\n   George Lucas: There are essentially nine films in a series of three\n   trilogies.The first trilogy is about the young Ben Kenobi and the\n   early life of Luke's father when Luke was a little boy. This trilogy\n   takes place some twenty years before the second trilogy, which\n   includes Star Wars and Empire. About a year or two passes between each\n   story of the trilogy and about twenty years pass between the\n   trilogies. The entire saga spans about fifty-five years.\n   AA: How much is written?\n   GL: I have story treatments on all nine. I also have voluminous notes,\n   histories, and other material I've developed for various purposes.\n   Some of it will be used, some not. Originally, when I wrote Star Wars,\n   it developed into an epic on the scale of War and Peace, so big I\n   couldn't possibly make it into a movie. So I cut it in half, but it\n   was still too big, so I cut each half into three parts. I then had\n   material for six movies. After the success of Star Wars I added\n   another trilogy, but stopped there, primarily because reality took\n   over. After all, it takes three years to prepare and make a Star Wars\n   picture. How many years are left? So I'm still left with three\n   trilogies of nine films. At two hours each, that's about eighteen\n   hours of film!\n   Straight from the equine's embouchement. Plus there're other Nine-Film\n   LucasQuotes in other sources, like his Splinter of the Mind's Eye\n   foreword.\nAhoatam\n   For all his film interestsnot just the companies but the extension of\n   Raiders' Indiana Jones character into two more features and a TV\n   serieshe was, and remains, a doting, full-time dad. But he had a\n   neglected child, the Star Wars saga, that needed his help in growing\n   up. Lucas began writing the new trilogy, starting with Phantom Menace,\n   in 1994.\n   Furthermore, Lucas says in the commentary of ANH DVD that he wrote a\n   backstory for each character, and that fed into what eventually made\n   the prequel story. He didn't have 6 or 9 ready-to-go screenplays, as\n   is the popular belief.\n   I, too, subscribe to the paint-himself-in-corner viewpoint.\nAmphibatron\n   And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of\n   things that were made up as they went along? That is just so wrong. GL\n   has had the entire story as an idea in his mind, since day one. He has\n   said this himself many times, and he is meticulous and does nothing\n   without much planning and foresight. I suggest you do a little\n   research.\n   If you look at early pre-production artwork of episode 1 you will see\n   that Qui-Gon is nowhere to be seen. Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to\n   himself. Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why\n   else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of\n   Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku?\n   Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department\n   to design a droid general. Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in\n   episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode\n   III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting\n   with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of\n   ROTJ because the darkside had slowly degraded his appearance. He\n   obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible.\n   If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels:\n   Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of\n   book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest\n   has been made up as he went along. I mean he said himself in a recent\n   interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints\n   he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same\n   percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority\n   of the back story Lucas originally planned out.\nAhoatam\n   05-07-2005, 05:11 PM\n   Back on topic:\n   The script seemed to have a lot of not-so-subtle remarks that related\n   directly to today's political and military situation. Until now, Star\n   Wars has really been a reflection on past political/military conflicts\n   (like the Third Reich) and this marks a noticable turn towards current\n   events.\n   How much of this carried over into the final film, and how much of it\n   do you think audiences will pick up on?

I'm all for bipartisanship in enjoyment of arts and entertainment.\nLightningLouie\n   Wouldn't it be cool if Lucas let some ILM underlings or intern types\n   at Lucas film, who have been waiting in the wings, getting coffee and\n   stuff for the senior artist for years, have a go at doing an animated\n   version of the first draft of Star Wars just for a goof? Well, woudn't\n   it? No? Fine! I'd buy it, or watch it on The Cartoon Network! Cary\n   on...\n   Hell no, I'd pay to see that.\n   Someone actually wrote a fan script of A Princess of Ondos, the\n   proposed second installment of The Adventures of The Starkiller,\n   mentioned in passing at the end of Lucas' first draft of Star Wars:\nEschatos\n   I think you're saying that Kenobi should have been the central\n   character of the PT. I couldn't agree more.\n   That's exactly what I was saying. (I was more focused on why\n   Anakin/Vader should have been a supporting character in that post, so\n   I understand the cautiousness of your post.) If you think about it,\n   actually, the films could be much more solid as they if they were\n   edited to focus more on Kenobi and less on Skywalker. The whole\n   problem with the PT is that Lucas, even during Ep. I, was too\n   concerned with giving Anakin significant screen coverage. Most of\n   Anakin's involvment in I and II are just subplots on steroids anyway\n   ...\n   Also, if they had gone that route, it would have made for a stronger\n   saga. The PT could have been the story of the benevolent father\n   failing to deliver his son from a path of evil and the OT would have\n   been the negative of that: the benevolent son delivers the father from\n   that path. The ramifications just cascade from there ... especially\n   when you consider the tension it would have given the Yoda and Sidious\n   relationship by making them the mentors of the central figures in the\n   story: the patriarchs.\nLightningLouie\n   Straight from the equine's embouchement.

In the somewhat divided\n   political state the US is in now, does Lucas risk alienating a portion\n   of his fan base by comparing the President to the Emporer? Comments\n   from those who have seen the film, please.\n   It's nothing new from Lucas; the political subtext was there from the\n   beginning, though it got submerged as the movies went on. The Emperor\n   was conceived of as a Nixon figure, a crafty politico turned paranoid\n   and inaccessible, and there was always the idea of a technologically\n   superior military force being thwarted by primitive indigenous\n   guerillas, like the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam. (Remember, Lucas was\n   originally going to follow up American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now,\n   so the Ewoks were probably his way of exploring that theme after\n   losing control of the project to Coppola.) In one of the deleted\n   scenes of Luke and Biggs on Tatooine, Biggs expresses concern that the\n   Empire will draft Luke into service. Star Wars is definitely a product\n   of the Watergate era, but it came out during the Carter\n   administration, so everybody associates it with the goofy, hedonistic\n   late '70s. By the '80s, Reagan and his speechwriters were using Lucas'\n   imagery as a metaphor for the Cold War, something he probably never\n   anticipated or desired. He never got over the use of \"Star Wars\" as a\n   collective term for orbital missile defense. In Ep. I, Lucas repays\n   Reagan in kind by naming the perennially befuddled and dim-witted\n   Trade Federation leader Nute Gunray; the \"Nute\" comes from Knute\n   Rockne All American, one of Reagan's best-known films, and as for\n   \"Gunray,\" just transpose the syllables. For a guy who celebrates\n   forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure hold a grudge; after\n   all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael,\n   who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier.\n   I would be genuinely surprised if most viewers made any sort of\n   connections between the storyline in Ep. III and current events,\n   mainly because it sounds as though the political aspects of\n   Palpatine's rise to power are dowplayed in favor of balls-to-the-wall\n   action. (Besides, as we all know, Lucas had it planned out in advance\n   all along, so any parallels are purely coincidental.) In all\n   likelihood, there will be one or two batshit crazy right-wing Medved\n   types who label Lucas a traitor after making all those good movies\n   about upholding conservative values, but most people won't care or\n   notice. And they'd be wrong about Lucas' politics, too; despite being\n   insanely wealthy, he still seems to regard himself as a radical\n   experimental filmmaker and unreconstructed liberal who managed to beat\n   the Man at his own game, acquiring his independence one marketing\n   license at a time. (Insert sarcastic comment about billionaire\n   entertainer lecturing about the dangers of attachment and materialism\n   here.) But even if he wanted to make Ep. III overtly political, I\n   doubt he'd be canny or subtle enough to pull it off, even in a dorky\n   Star Trek kinda way.\nAhoatam\n   Well put, Louie, thanks.

You asked\n   why people believe the prequels are full of things made up as he went\n   along and I gave you numerous examples.\nmastronikolas\n   I finally saw it.\n   It's a very powerful piece of film-making and the first time we get\n   real characters and real emotion in the prequel trilogy. The ending is\n   near-perfect. Vader being entombed in the suit, Yoda's humility after\n   failing the Jedi and the Republic, the delivery of the twins. Amazing\n   stuff.\n   It's perfectly obvious that the Jedi were responsible for their own\n   fall, paying the price for being blinded , dogmatic and overconfident.\n   And Lucas doesn't shy away from the fact that his movie is about\n   brother turning against brother. The characters face horrible dilemmas\n   and no one walks away unscathed.\n   The opening battle is awe-inspiring. Words can do it no justice. The\n   only thing I can say is that the reveal of the hundreds of capital\n   ships fighting far surpasses the reveal of the Star Destroyer in\n   Episode IV.\n   Grievous is a total red herring and a wild goose chase for Obi-Wan. If\n   you expect that, you'll like his part (which is a very minor one). If\n   you expect the death machine from the cartoons, you'll be\n   disappointed.\n   And there's a wickedly irreverent homage to E.T.\n   Finally, I predict that there will be a lot of wee ones crying their\n   little hearts out when Anakin starts burning alive. It's very graphic\n   and heart-wrenching. This is definitely not a movie for small\n   children.\nAlan \"Nordling\" Cerny\n   Oddly enough, mastronikolas, of all the CHUD posters yours was the one\n   I was waiting for. Thanks for that. Can't wait...\nLitmus Configuration\n   And there's a wickedly irreverent homage to E.T.\n   I missed that. Where is it?\nmastronikolas\n   Yoda's departure from Kashyyk:\n   \"I'll miss you Tarful.

But then\n   again, I guess he doesnt fully come to grips with the SW Buddhist-lite\n   notion of reality until episode 5.\nLitmus Configuration\n   Yoda's departure from Kashyyk:\n   \"I'll miss you Tarful. I'll miss you Chewbacca\". And then he blasts\n   off in his little rocket ship!\n   I guess the close-up on Yoda's face as the hatch shuts closed is what\n   really makes it an homage to E.T., if that's what it really is. The\n   good-byes and ship take-off also work as homage but are also necessary\n   to getting Yoda off Kashyyk.\n   By the way, I saw the film version and there was no scene depicting\n   Wat Tambor's epic fight against anakin. Was that scene in the DLP\n   version?\n   Wat Tambor was barely in the DLP version. Just enough for the Cult of\n   Wat to jizz their slacks and for the rest of us to roll our eyes.\n   To be fair, I was actually hoping to see more of Wat before he got\n   diced. I was hoping to have a quick reminder of why I hate this\n   ill-conceived character before he is then thankfully murdered. No such\n   luck. Wat is merely a blur in his demise.\nEstel\n   My take, copied and pasted from a message I wrote someone on the night\n   I saw it. I reserve the right to modify this kneejerk opinion when I\n   see it again with a normal audience on release.\n   Yeah, it's not so good, but it's not a disaster. This one is\n   particularly frustrating for me, though, because it has entire moments\n   and scenes that DO play, that work emotionally, thematically, or\n   whatever, but are constantly being undermined by glaring problems:\n   poorly written/delivered lines, moments of weird, choppy, meaningless\n   editing (Ben Burtt fucks this movie backasswards just like Clones),\n   small scenelets that are over before they start (the 2nd act is\n   plagued by this), and just mismanaged stuff that could have been\n   great, or at least passable.\n   It's just so painfully obvious that Lucas' reach exceeds his grasp.\n   There's some great non-verbal bits set to music: I loved the clones\n   turning on the jedi across the galaxy, beautiful score, and a real\n   sense of loss, but it's pretty contextless. Similarly, he goes for\n   this Coppola-esque Birth of the Twins/Birth of Vader intercutting\n   that's really magnificent all by itself (Padme's screams during labor\n   cutting to the absolutely wrecked Anakin screaming as his limbs are\n   re-attached) but it belongs in a different, better movie. He breaks\n   his own SW rules all over the place in this scene (there's actually a\n   POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation\n   chamber being in the suit is).\n   McDiarmid is nasty, campy fun, just as he was in ROTJ, and everyone\n   else pretty much acquits themselves admirably. McGregor has fantastic\n   moments, but also many, many others, where he clearly just can't take\n   this bullshit seriously anymore (see his lines to Dooku before they\n   fight). Portman and Christensen are much improved, especially\n   Christensen, who I think does an admirable job with an almost\n   unplayabe character. Who knows why anyone in this movie does anything,\n   other than puppetmaster Lucas.\n   I thought that much of the duel was really good, actually, contrary to\n   the Chud crew consensus. I actually thought that bar a few lines, the\n   last fourth of the film was a hint of the A-game that Lucas could have\n   brought to the whole deal, back in the day, had he cared to. He\n   clearly took his time with certain sequences (the purge/assault on the\n   temple, the massacre/baptism, oops I mean \"Birthing\" sequence), and he\n   pretty much went ahead and neglected the connective tissue that makes\n   such sequences make sense, just like in the last film.\n   Again, before I'm torn to shreds, this is just quick thoughts jotted\n   down after seeing it last week. I actually feel a little nicer to it\n   in the light of day. I'll make up my mind on the 19th.\nAmphibatron\n   Wait, can someone confirm that the Wookiees give Tarzan yells like\n   Chewbacca in Jedi?

At least not in the foreground.\nmastronikolas\n   ...there's actually a POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a\n   frightening isolation chamber being in the suit is\n   My favourite shot in the whole film. It really ads depth to Vader\n   asking Luke to remove his helmet, so that he can see him with his own\n   eyes.\n   My favourite sequences (apart from the amazing opening) were centered\n   on Obi-Wan. His realisation of what he must do, his confrontation of\n   Padme and his final words with Anakin are really strong. Terrific\n   acting by Ewan.\nAmphibatron\n   It does.\n   Mother of fuck.\nEli Ca$h\n   I don't think I have much to say about the film that hasn't already\n   been said in this thread. My take is pretty much right in the middle\n   of everything mentioned here. I didn't love it like I wanted to, but I\n   did enjoy it overall.\n   The sad thing is, I think if Anakin's turn to the dark side had\n   worked, everything else would be forgivable.\n   My biggest regret about these films will always be that he directed\n   them all himself. He could have stepped aside after TPM and let\n   someone else handle AOTC and ROTS. Considering some of the names that\n   were said to be interested, I don't think we would have seen most of\n   the things that bugged me in those films.\n   I can't imagine Spielberg doing that crappy space diner scene or the\n   floating fruit scene. I think He would have found some way to make the\n   Anakin-Padme dialogue work. I can't imagine David Fincher having so\n   much droid comedy in ROTS, nor the terrible Windu death/Anakin turns\n   scene. I also can't imagine him having Anakin hop on a droid's head\n   and ride over to continue the duel with Obi-Wan.\nAmphibatron\n   Not in my print. At least not in the foreground.\n   Does this mean I have to call the theatre and ask them if they are\n   showing the print with the retarded tarzan yell or without it?\n   Seriously, the only theatre getting my money is the one without. I'll\n   be damned if I'll relive the lowest point in the OT come may 19th.\nAlan \"Nordling\" Cerny\n   Oh c'mon. If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here.

Can't Lucas make one\n   goddamn movie where I don't have to either stomach something , forgive\n   something, overlook something, pretend that didn't happen, fast\n   forward through that part, cover my ears, scratch out my eyes....\nSuttytx\n   The Tarzan yell and the Sarlac burp in ROTJ are the two lowest points\n   of humor in the OT for me.

All he had to do was admit that\n   Star Wars fans scare the bejesus out of him.\n   McGregors thoughts on the basement-dwelling fanboys were as follows:\n   \"There's this huge following, which is weird. They have big meets and\n   conventions, and I find it all a bit frightening. Once this guy met me\n   at a stage door when I was doing a play in London. The guy yelled,\n   'Obi-Wan. Do you have any advice for a trainee Jedi?' I just said,\n   'No, don't be so ridiculous.' If McGregor thinks that constantly being\n   asked to whip out his light saber is creepy, then he better prepare\n   himself for the reaction hell get from his upcoming project Gnomeo and\n   Juliet. Ewan will voice the character Gnomeo to Kate Winslets Juliet\n   in the story of indoor gnome-outdoor gnome love (and, no, we\n   absolutely did not make this up). Once McGregor gets a taste of those\n   psychotic garden gnome fans, hell be begging to appear next to Mark\n   Hamill at every Star Wars convention.\nThe Sphinx\n   Spracht Scott. Pseudo-random excerpts:\n   This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the\n   best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my\n   inner 11-year-old shudders as I type this): it's better than \"Star\n   Wars.\"\n   ...\n   But every picture, however ravishing, needs a story, and the best way\n   to appreciate how well this one succeeds is to consider the obstacles\n   it must surmount in winning over its audience. First of all, though\n   there are a few surprises tucked into the narrative (which I won't\n   give away), everybody knows the big revelation of the end, since it\n   was also the big revelation at the end of the previous trilogy: Darth\n   Vader is Luke's father. We also know, for the most part, which of the\n   major figures are going to survive the various perils they face. So an\n   element of suspense is missing from the outset.\n   More than that, the trajectory of the narrative cuts sharply against\n   the optimistic grain of blockbuster Hollywood, in that we are\n   witnessing a flawed hero devolving into a cruel and terrifying\n   villain. It is a measure of the film's accomplishment that this\n   process is genuinely upsetting, even if we are reminded that a measure\n   of redemption lies over the horizon in \"Return of the Jedi.\" And while\n   Mr. Christensen's acting falls short of portraying the full\n   psychological texture of this transformation, Mr. Lucas nonetheless\n   grounds it in a cogent and (for the first time) comprehensible\n   political context.\n   \"This is how liberty dies - to thunderous applause,\" Padm observes as\n   senators, their fears and dreams of glory deftly manipulated by\n   Palpatine, vote to give him sweeping new powers. \"Revenge of the Sith\"\n   is about how a republic dismantles its own democratic principles,\n   about how politics becomes militarized, about how a Manichaean\n   ideology undermines the rational exercise of power. Mr. Lucas is\n   clearly jabbing his light saber in the direction of some real-world\n   political leaders. At one point, Darth Vader, already deep in the\n   thrall of the dark side and echoing the words of George W. Bush,\n   hisses at Obi-Wan, \"If you're not with me, you're my enemy.\" Obi-Wan's\n   response is likely to surface as a bumper sticker during the next\n   election campaign: \"Only a Sith thinks in absolutes.\" You may applaud\n   this editorializing, or you may find it overwrought, but give Mr.\n   Lucas his due. For decades he has been blamed (unjustly) for helping\n   to lead American movies away from their early-70's engagement with\n   political matters, and he deserves credit for trying to bring them\n   back.\n   But of course the rise of the Empire and the perdition of Anakin\n   Skywalker are not the end of the story, and the inverted chronology\n   turns out to be the most profound thing about the \"Star Wars\" epic.\n   Taken together, and watched in the order they were made, the films\n   reveal the cyclical nature of history, which seems to repeat itself\n   even as it moves forward. Democracies swell into empires, empires are\n   toppled by revolutions, fathers abandon their sons and sons find their\n   fathers. Movies end. Life goes on.That's a solid three stars at the\n   very least. Interesting that Scott thinks the middle-is-the-end\n   chronology of the two trilogies works... that it not only works, but\n   resonates with the whole 'Force' theme of Star Wars.\n   I'm a little encouraged by that review. It's a better explanation for\n   liking the film than 'Darth Vader's in it!' and 'Wow, it looks just\n   like the original Star Wars at the end!' On the other hand, I wonder\n   if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting\n   George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth. Good fun for liberals like\n   myself, but not necessarily right for Star Wars.\nSamurai Mike\n   Isn't it funny how Padme comments on loss of liberty, when it was HER\n   fucking off and giving Jar Jar the vote in AOTC that led to it!! She\n   complains about genocide in TPM, then shrugs her shoulders when Anakin\n   admits to it in the second film. And I hear she has even LESS to do in\n   this one, other than gestate.\n   Thats stupid.\nsmugbug\n   Oh c'mon. If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here. It's\n   as if people must have their SW totally humorless. So Lucas can't tell\n   a joke to save his ass, get over it.\n   I intend on seeing this flick after consuming the sufficient amount of\n   beer. By \"sufficient\" I mean, whatever amount necessary that it would\n   make me at least laugh out loud to even the bad jokes.\n   Hmmmmm....and thats the dilemma. Not enough beer, and I will feel my\n   ass getting numb. Too much, and I'll just pass out and miss the whole\n   thing. Er....my vote is for too much.\n   Beer seems to be the necessary item so that someone could tolerate\n   this movie. Hey, is there even a \"beer drinking game\" possible in this\n   installment?\nMicah Robinson\n   The Ebert review is up:\n   Also, I'm going to close this thread and start with a fresh clean\n   slate shortly before the Wednesday midnight screenings.\nAhoatam\n   On the other hand, I wonder if Scott is just a little giddy over the\n   idea that Lucas is putting George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth.\n   Good fun for liberals like myself, but not necessarily right for Star\n   Wars.\n   This is what I'm trying to get at. While most of the folks here\n   probably won't mind, and even enjoy such thinly-veiled criticism of\n   the current administration, I think to a decent portion of the\n   population it may come across as extreme partisanship. While many of\n   you have illustrated Lucas' political subtexts in other SW films, I\n   think it's a lot more in-your-face in ROTS, which is very un-Star\n   Wars.\n   So forgetting the fact that the film may endorse your own personal\n   view of the current administration (by your own, I mean anyone here),\n   it is wise for Lucas to risk dis-associating half of his audience who\n   simply wanted to see the end of a space opera and not an idictment on\n   the guy they voted for and maybe still have faith in? Seriously, not\n   looking for a political lecture here, because no one's going to change\n   anyone's mind, just looking for some honest looks at what this means\n   for Star Wars.\n   Granted, it could be argued that Lucas had this story set in '99,\n   before Bush, but I think the sudden thrust of politics to the center\n   of the Star Wars stage warrants some discussion.\ncognizant\n   The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely\n   wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin\n   Skywalker with politics involved. The trilogy could have just focused\n   on him and Obi 1. The Emperor and his political manoeuvres could has\n   just been vaguely hinted at in the background of the universe. I think\n   the focus on politics was in part, written to raise SW slightly above\n   that often derided concept of 'mass popular culture' to be taken\n   slightly more seriously by adults and prehaps be perceived as\n   something even integral, or meaningful to culture, rather than\n   something to simply escape to for a few hours, but obviously Lucas has\n   failed at this, the story has suffered as a result. Seeing geeky\n   teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important\n   Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable.\n   SW shouldnt be taken seriously, its an escapist adventure tale without\n   logic, but full of spunk. Well, the first trilogy was anyway. The\n   second trilogy appears to me as a schizophrenic mish mash of mediocre\n   sci-fi, and the frantic attempts of an ageing man trying to\n   update/modify/remix his legacy.\nMicah Robinson\n   That's just silly. You can't depict the creation of a dictator-led\n   military empire without focusing on politics. Anakin's turn occurs\n   within this context, not outside of it. Besides, Palpatine's\n   machinations were scripted and depicted BEFORE Bush's war on Iraq.\n   Besides, the Jedi are the UN, and they certainly don't come off as\n   heroic, smart, or helpful in the least in this film, so there's\n   criticism of the Right and the Left to be found in spades. If people\n   can only see the obvious Bush metaphors, then they're not even really\n   looking at the film.\nCharlie Brigden\n   The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely\n   wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin\n   Skywalker with politics involved.

Seeing geeky\n   teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important\n   Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable.\n   I disagree. The trilogy isn't just about Anakin, but also the Empire,\n   and especially since Palpatine plays such an important role in\n   Anakin's development and eventual turn, all of Palpatine's\n   maneouverings are entirely necessary. For example, showing him getting\n   into the chancellor's position, his growing influence over the Jedi,\n   and subsequent acts against them. It's also the most interesting stuff\n   in all of the prequels.\n   To be fair, ever since the 70s and the whole journal of the whills\n   deal, the rise of the Empire has always been described as this big\n   corruption of politics. I think saying it's trying to be taken\n   seriously by including politics is overly-cynical.\nLitmus Configuration\n   Actually, I would liked to have seen more of Palpatine's politics and\n   less of Jar Jar's...well, anything. All of that precious screen time,\n   wasted. (And that's not another tired criticism of what a terrible\n   character Jar Jar is...more like a criticism of Lucas' storytelling\n   priorities.) When Palpatine and Anakin discuss the Sith during the\n   opera, I actually leaned forward in my theater seat. More of the\n   phantom menace's origins would have been appreciated by this viewer.\nmastronikolas\n   The politics were absolutely necessary for the story.\n   There's a clear parallel between the Republic rotting from the inside\n   and turning into a dictatorship and Anakin starting out as a decent\n   person and turning into evil incarnate.\n   And ultimately, the Senate scenes were about 20 minutes of screen time\n   out of six-and-a-half hours of story.\ncognizant\n   Meeeh, I'll concede that it works with emphasis on politics, just\n   didnt work for me with this specific vision. Besides, the OT hardly\n   has any politics, and those films are meant to depict the end of an\n   empire and the re-establishment of the status quo, or some type of\n   equilibrium, and all we get is a few throwaway lines about some senate\n   or something.\n   I still think the PT could have worked without any direct emphasis on\n   politics, it just would have been in the background, like online\n   political debates/campaign adverts, or news of conflicts or coup de\n   tat's, that characters would watch ocassionally to keep up to date\n   with the situation, or the presence of stormtroopers slowly\n   multiplying in more and more worlds, etc, it just could have been done\n   subtlely, rather than the way we've seen it.\n   And I'll admit, that when it comes to SW, I'm very cynical, but I cant\n   help it, the over the top, and increasinly ridiculous merchandise\n   aspect just leaves me cold.\nMicah Robinson\n   Yes, relegating Ian McDarmid - the shining jewel of this installment\n   according to almost every review, even the negative ones - to a less\n   prominent role would certainly help the current Star Wars films work\n   better. Slice his screentime in half and let's have some more witty\n   battle droid banter.\nCharlie Brigden\n   Because the merchandise levels of the OT were low?\n   The point is, the OT never had politics because it was a different\n   time. The Emperor dissolves all the diplomatic bits early in ANH, with\n   Tarkin stating \"the remnants of the Old Republic have been swept\n   away.\" This is the point, that any chance of democracy, of change has\n   been completely and utterly destroyed, giving the motivation for the\n   whole movement of the Rebellion.\ndevincf\n   Because the merchandise levels of the OT were low?\n   The point is, the OT never had politics because it was a different\n   time.

I like the prequels\n   for what they are, but I know in my gut they could've been so much\n   more. I really wish Lucas would've kept his producing hat on, directed\n   the effects and animation sequences (where his true passions lie), and\n   left the screenwriting and directing the actors to someone(s) who\n   could interject a little humanity.\n   Most of the ideas, themes, even design and set pieces in the PT are\n   intellectually sound. The problem is that no one feels anything. And\n   if they do, generally its out of a sense of nostalgia rather than\n   immediate tugging at the heartstrings.\n   Lucas is a master visualist. He also has a pretty good sense of story\n   structure and has some really innovative ideas. The problem is the guy\n   is admittedly impatient when it comes to the writing and directing\n   processes.\n   The politics of the PT are an interesting inclusion to the SW\n   storyline, but they are far too talky and overcomplicated for their\n   own good. Much like this post. Ahem, there is no immediate drama\n   involved in the politics until ROTS. That to me, is a huge mistake.\n   The PT as well as Matrix: Reloaded and Matrix: Revolutions are\n   examples of first draft scripts, directors with too much power and no\n   one to check them, and misplaced priorities. Best intentions, even\n   when they are completely revealed via commentaries, interviews, etc.,\n   cannot make up for lackluster execution.\n   Remember that old Godzilla dig that ILM had? PLOT DOES MATTER? How\n   about DRAMA DOES MATTER?\ndevincf\n   You can't cheat like that when your main villain is the man taking\n   over the government.\n   No, that's the main villain of the PT where boring politics are the\n   forefront. A PT with less politics could have had the Emperor in as\n   minimal a role as he had in the OT.\nMicah Robinson\n   No, that's the main villain of the PT where boring politics are the\n   forefront. A PT with less politics could have had the Emperor in as\n   minimal a role as he had in the OT.\n   No thanks. McDarmid's evolution from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor\n   is not only one of the best parts of the PT, but also the perfect\n   platform for illustrating the arrogance and flaws of the Jedi.\n   Now, the separatist talks, along with the other irrelevant races and\n   the senate debates could have been minimized for sure. But anything\n   subtracting from McDarmid's screentime hurts these movies, IMHO.\ncognizant\n   No thanks. McDarmid's evolution from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor\n   is not only one of the best parts of the PT, but also the perfect\n   platform for illustrating the arrogance and flaws of the Jedi.\n   Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been\n   the wankers we have seen them to be. Making them incredibly dull,\n   brainless and flawed, makes their downfall so much easier to write.\n   Its harder to creatively bring about the downfall of something thats\n   working right, but Lucas...\n   Anyway my opinion still stands, the story of Anakin's fall did not\n   need focus on politics, or even the Emperor, as Devin says, this I'm\n   sure is a minority opinion, but I think still a valid one, any one of\n   us could come up with three screenplays that could be on par with the\n   OT without resorting to real world political allegories. Well not any\n   one of us, but you get the jist. If we were basing the PT off of what\n   we'd seen in the OT, all we'd essentially need, is the Clone Wars, and\n   thats it.\n   Defending the focus on politics, simply because of McDarmid's\n   performance, surely means that everything else was bollocks. I'd\n   rather downsize his role, in exchange for a better trilogy of films as\n   a whole, with an exciting, original and involving narrative.\nAhoatam\n   From the very beginning, the PT is infused with overly complicated\n   politics, when in the OT there were virtually none. Dispute over the\n   taxation of trade routes? Wat???\n   Why can't we give Padme a couple of throwaway lines to cover what's\n   going on in the Senate? \"Okay, Anakin, pookie, I'm going to go vote\n   against the creation of a republic army, because that would give the\n   Chancellor a chance to be naughty. See you later.\"\ndudalb\n   I think where Lucas shoots himself in the foot with his political\n   commentary is in Obi Wan's reply \"Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes\".\n   Considering that for five films one of the basis is a very absolute\n   idea of good vs evil (Empire/Sith Bad, Republic/Jedi Good) it's a\n   little late to be condemning absolutes. A reply from Obi Wan like \"You\n   are truly from the Dark Side, Chacellor\" would have been a hell of a\n   lot better.\n   Lucas leaves himself wide open with that remark.\nSamurai Mike\n   Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been\n   the wankers we have seen them to be.

How could a group of such ignorant,\n   close-minded, arrogant and just downright stupid people be the\n   guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations?

Richard\n   ok I just read most of the thread, and having just finished watching\n   the film I still don't understand the anakin conception deal.\n   Palpatine tells Anakin a story of a great Darth lord that knew the\n   darisk side of the force so well he could blah blah blah midichlorians\n   blah blah with merely a look. All right, so according to the story,\n   Darth Plagus (Plagius, Plageus? whatev) conceived Anakin while Sidious\n   was his apprentice. Sidious murders his master in his sleep and takes\n   over the Anakin plot himself. That's what I got from it. And assuming\n   Palpatine is lying and did the whole scheme himself seems like a\n   pointless assumption. \"Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.\"?\n   Not good enough. He plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting\n   axed in his sleep by his apprentice as if he was the one who did it.\n   If we can believe that part, why can we not believe that Palpatine\n   wasn't the telepathic sperm donor?\n   I think the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who\n   murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up\n   stories that take away from his supposed genius.\nRene A. Moncivais\n   I didn't know Jerry Jones was in this?\nMrMushnik\n   \"Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.\"? Not good enough. He\n   plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting axed in his sleep by\n   his apprentice as if he was the one who did it. If we can believe that\n   part, why can we not believe that Palpatine wasn't the telepathic\n   sperm donor?\n   I think the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who\n   murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up\n   stories that take away from his supposed genius.\n   Good liars mix their lies with the truth though. He could be telling\n   Anakin the truth about his master and at the same time leading Anakin\n   to believe that he is the one responsible for his creation. That way\n   he hooks Anakin with the \"creating life\" part and then goes on and\n   pits himself against Obi-Wan as a father figure. And plus we've alrady\n   seen more or less the same scenario in Episdode 2 when Dooku tries to\n   recruit Obi-Wan.\nLitmus Configuration\n   I think the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who\n   murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up\n   stories that take away from his supposed genius.\n   I agree. This whole silly \"Palpatine is lying\" theory is incredibly\n   thin. Besides, Obi-Wan has told far more lies than Palpatine. \"Certain\n   point of view,\" my ass. I'd wager that if you took all of Palpatine's\n   dialogue from the films and do the same with Obi-Wan, Palpy would win\n   the \"Who's More Truthful?\" contest hands down.\nmastronikolas\n   The fact that Palpatine seduces Anakin by essentially telling the\n   truth (even if it is \"from a certain point of view\") is one of the\n   most interesting facets of Sith.\n   Besides, I don't get the whole uproar about his \"revelation\". I enjoy\n   the fact that Lucas leaves it to us to choose if Palpatine was behind\n   Anakin's creation or not. I much prefer that than being spoon-fed a\n   definite answer.\nSatan's Hamster\n   I intend on seeing this flick after consuming the sufficient amount of\n   beer. By \"sufficient\" I mean, whatever amount necessary that it would\n   make me at least laugh out loud to even the bad jokes.\n   Hmmmmm....and thats the dilemma. Not enough beer, and I will feel my\n   ass getting numb. Too much, and I'll just pass out and miss the whole\n   thing. Er....my vote is for too much.\n   Beer seems to be the necessary item so that someone could tolerate\n   this movie. Hey, is there even a \"beer drinking game\" possible in this\n   installment?\n   Don't go crying if you get alcohol poisoning! I think there sould be a\n   drinking game where you have to do a shot of vodka every time someone\n   says something stupid, in which case, should you die after seeing the\n   film and you were too be cremated, your body would burn for three\n   months!!!\nmastronikolas\n   Smugbug and little fury fourteen-year-old, I envy your prescient\n   abilities.\nSatan's Hamster\n   First of all you fucking twats, there was no need for politics in the\n   OT because The Empire had been in control for close to 20 years and I\n   doubt that the Rebellion would have very successful by launching a\n   political attack when the Emperor would just fry their ass with Sith\n   Lightning. If this was Mr. Skywalker Goes To Washington, A New Hope\n   wouldn't have been about trying to destroy a Death Star, it would have\n   been about Luke going to the Galactic senate and making his case that\n   the Empire is evil and that the Emperor and Darth Vader were very\n   naughty men while wagging his finger at them as the senate hiss and\n   boo as they slide into the shadows. Politics are at the very heart of\n   how Palpatine takes over the senate and to ignore that for more space\n   battles would be stupid and Im quite sure that most of the people that\n   are bitching and moaning about the politics here are Republicans and\n   they dont particularly like looking into the mirror because theyre all\n   fucking monkeys with their eyes, mouth and ears closed!\nSatan's Hamster\n   Another thing fuckwads, how the hell did you think Hitler got to\n   power.

God Bless you all.\n       Cathy Teeter (Yorktown, VA) snowflake1959@msn.com\nI loved her from the day she was born, my beautiful\n       grand-daughter, Michelle, now an angel in God's kingdom where love\n       reigns supreme, where pain is no more. Cancer devastated her body,\n       but never her spirit and her love of life she fought for so\n       valiantly, and so long.

She never gave up hope in her\n       battle, she always had her sense of humor and made the best of the\n       situation.. I came in contact with Michelle last year when I was\n       going through a colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. I was very\n       scared, being only 23 and having gone through this at a young age,\n       she was able to relate to the anxiety and fear I was experiencing.\n       She gave me hope and courage no matter what the outcome would be.\n       Thankfully, I was clear, but later that year I lost my grandmother\n       and my grandfather both to cancer. They were both only in their\n       60's and they raised me, so this was like losing my parents. Her\n       words gave me strength, and her story inspired me to make the most\n       of every day and to live my life to the fullest.

My condolences\n       to you, her family.\n       Nathalie Baldwin (Cincinnati, OH)\nI hadn't heard from Michelle in awhile & I hadn't been on here\n       because my cancer came back & I have been very sick. I decided to\n       come on here today to check my e-mail & look at things I hadn't\n       seen in a long time. I decided to check out Michelle's site to see\n       how she was. I am utterly devastasted that she is no longer with\n       us. It is so unfair that such a beautiful person had such a short\n       life. I found her site when I was first diagnosed & everything she\n       went through at first was identical to what I was going through.\n       She helped me so much when I thought I couldn't get through this.\n       She would e-mail when I was down & give me encouragement. She gave\n       me such hope & now I am just totally devastated. I feel so bad\n       that I just found out now. I just want her family to know that I\n       prayed for her daily & that you should be so proud & were so lucky\n       to have had such a wonderful & beautiful angel in your life. I\n       know that she is looking down on all of us that she helped & loved\n       & she will continue to help us. My heart is hurting so much right\n       now. Even though I only talked to her on-line, I considered her a\n       dear friend. My hope was to meet her in person one day. I will\n       miss her more than words can say. I don't know how I'm going to\n       get through this without her. Thank you to her family for sharing\n       her with us. God Bless You All! Love, Maria\n       Maria Bozzarelli (Mt.

        "articleBody": "CITIZENS for Limited Taxation\nCLT Update\nLook quick! -- they're squandering away our tax cut hand over fist\n   then warning that the sky's about to fall, there's not enough left to\n   keep the promise and return the income tax rate to 5 percent,\" they're\n   now trying to tell us. \"Sorry folks, it's all gone and the good times\n   are coming to an end anyway.\"\n\nIsn't it strange how it's never a good time for a tax cut. When times\n   are good they \"invest\" the overpayment while it's available; when\n   times are bad they need the overpayment for \"safety nets\" and \"unmet\n   needs.\" Then they come back for more.\n\nBut note the big error by the reporter when she states: \"If Cellucci's\n   pitch to reduce the income tax rate in stages from 5.95 percent to 5\n   percent is successful, it could take $1.2 billion out of the coffers\n   in just the first year...\"\n\nThis is an inaccurate statement. Gov. Cellucci's plan would phase in\n   his tax rate reduction over three years; when fully implemented, in\n   the third year, it would reduce revenue by about $1.2 billion.\n\nRegardless, when the pols took the money from us with their\n   \"temporary\" rate increase, did anyone ask if you could afford it, or\n   whether you'd rather if they phased it in gradually over a number of\n   years?\n\nAnd what's this \"take $1.2 billion out of the coffers\"? It shouldn't\n   still be going into the coffers!\n\nChip Ford \n\nThe Boston Globe\nEconomists say state should temper spending\nPossible slowdown could squeeze budget\nBy Tina Cassidy\n\nIt was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill lawmakers, worried\n     about financial crises overseas and a spate of local layoffs, were\n     talking about belt-tightening, hoarding cash, and boosting the\n     state's rainy day fund in anticipation of a recession that some\n     seemed certain was just over the horizon.\n\nBut money kept pouring in. The political rhetoric about how many\n     months the $1.2 billion emergency reserves could sustain the state\n     began to fade. Agendas blossomed. Spending became the order of the\n     day.\n\nGovernor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in\n     Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate\n     and heap millions of dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks\n     later he said he wanted to spend another $300 million from a\n     projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements.\n\nEven before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M.\n     Finneran unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public\n     preschool and full-day kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F.\n     Birmingham cited the surging economy as a reason to sharply\n     increase the minimum wage.\n\nDespite the spending euphoria, economists are still nervous about\n     the not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will be created.\n     The financial service sector could be hit by a stock market crash.\n     And consumer confidence may wane.\n\n\"One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99,\" says\n     Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. \"It\n     doesn't have to go down the tubes like it did a decade ago.... A\n     recession is unlikely and Massachusetts wouldn't do any worse than\n     the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it stayed\n     down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means people\n     should be more cautious, not less cautious.\"\n\nWhile Cellucci's budget message for next year is filled with\n     warnings about \"profligate spending\" and reminders \"of what can\n     happen when government gets caught up in the euphoria that prevails\n     during a robust economy,\" his record $20.4 billion spending plan\n     represents a 5 percent boost over fiscal 1999, giving\n     across-the-board increases to dozens of agencies and programs.\n\nThe Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group,\n     issued two reports last month, \"Reaching the Breaking Point: The\n     Commonwealth's Capital Dilemma\" and \"Budget '99: Containing the\n     Euphoria,\" both flagging the potential for a crisis.\n\n\"We're still phasing in last year's tax cuts. The economy has\n     already outperformed everyone's expectation for much longer than\n     anyone anticipated. This clearly can't go on forever and there are\n     some problems,\" said Michael Widmer, executive director of the\n     taxpayers foundation.\n\nHe points to the so-called budget busters -- funding for the MBTA,\n     health care for state employees, and Medicaid -- climbing to\n     unforeseen levels.\n\n\"The budget is exploding,\" Widmer added. \"At the same time, we have\n     this huge problem of trying to identify enough capital resources to\n     invest in a long list of important priorities while paying for the\n     Central Artery.\"\n\nLast week, Cellucci said he would pour much of the state's cash\n     surplus into one-time highway and bridge projects, taking some of\n     the pressure off the capital budget.\n\nBut such a spending luxury could be short-lived.\n\nThe state's infrastructure -- roads, buildings, bridges, pipes,\n     etc. -- is among the oldest in the nation and could easily siphon\n     millions out of the general fund for needed repairs over the next\n     few years. If Cellucci's pitch to reduce the income tax rate in\n     stages from 5.95 percent to 5 percent is successful, it could take\n     $1.2 billion out of the coffers in just the first year [sic],\n     possibly eliminating any surplus, thereby stretching the capital\n     budget thinner.\n\nFrederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank who\n     believes the state's soaring times are in for a \"soft landing,\"\n     said it is evident that politicians are struggling to determine how\n     to spend this year's cash without permanently elevating\n     expectations.\n\n\"Growth is likely to diminish,\" Breimyer said. \"The political\n     establishment here is trying to find a middle line. I think they've\n     done a reasonably good job. There has been a sense of prudence. And\n     I think prudence is warranted.\"\n\nHowever, cities and towns, which have received local aid increases\n     each of the last eight years -- a 113 percent overall jump in\n     spending since 1992 -- are already clamoring for more than the $4.5\n     billion Cellucci is offering for next year.\n\nHolyoke Mayor Daniel Szostkiewicz says major local aid increases\n     over the last four years have fueled a renaissance in his city,\n     luring young families back who once would have shunned the shabby\n     schools, which now have new books and are wired for the Internet.\n\n\"It was great. It was absolutely phenomenal,\" Szostkiewicz. \"But\n     when you go from multimillion dollar increases to level funding, it\n     feels like you're just hitting a wall.\"\n\nOf course, he is already talking about \"working the Legislature\" on\n     getting more than the $60 million Holyoke is already promised.\n\nAll this frustrates the governor's office.\n\n\"You can't open the piggy bank for everyone all the time,\" said\n     Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer. \"You have to impose controls.\n     The most critical way to do that is to take money off the table by\n     reducing the income tax.\"\n\nWill the Legislature approve the rate cut?\n\nSenate President Birmingham hopes not.\n\n\"I'm not Nostradamus,\" he said. \"And I don't know if the governor\n     has Nostradamus advising him. I don't know when the economy will\n     slow down ... and for that reason I take a cautious approach.\""

        "articleBody": "Cocoa Dev Central\n\n Advice on Learning C\n\nby William Moss\n\nWhen you first start playing around with Interface Builder and\n   prototyping some cool interfaces, it's easy to get excited about\n   Cocoa's potential. If you've ever read an old-school book on Mac\n   programming like Scott Knaster's \"How to Write Macintosh Software\"\n   you'll appreciate the power and simplicity of just drawing your user\n   interface. (If you haven't played around with these tools yet, check\n   out Erik J. Barzeski's \"Two Lines of Code\" article for a gentle\n   introduction.)\n\nCocoa's Interface Builder is even better than other \"visual interface\"\n   toolkits like HyperCard, FaceSpan, and FileMaker's layout tools\n   because what you create doesn't just try to imitate the feel of a Mac\n   interface, it really is a Mac user interface. There are other toolkits\n   on other platforms which offer this simplicity, but the Mac OS X\n   developer tools will be the first time they have been freely available\n   for all levels of Mac developers to use. In the past, I had tried\n   unsuccessfully to master old-school Mac programming. Interface Builder\n   was what convinced me that perhaps things were changing now and\n   learning to program a Mac was an attainable goal for a scripter like\n   me.\n\nThere was a big gap for me though. Apple provides some good\n   documentation for learning Objective-C, but they didn't write anything\n   about learning standard ANSI C. This omission is intentional and\n   understandable. Apple doesn't provide developer documentation to teach\n   you how to touch type, use the mouse, or perform other \"basic\"\n   pre-requisites. So it looked like I was going to have to start out\n   either learning C or Java before I could get to anything remotely\n   Apple relevent like Cocoa.\n\n\nWhat About Java?\n\nWhen I started, I wanted to learn Java. It was a language with a lot\n   of industry \"buzz.\" It had huge class libraries already written. It\n   had a syntax that was more understandable to my Hypercard and\n   AppleScript roots than C did. And I really didn't fancy the idea of\n   having to learn two languages (C and Objective-C) before moving on to\n   what I was really interested in.\n\nI spent a lot of time finding good references on Java. If you want to\n   pursue this route I highly recommend Bruce Eckel's \"Thinking In Java\"\n   Second Edition. It is one\n   of the most readable and understandable introductions to Java, and\n   ultimately it was why I gave up on the language for the time being.\n   The book's CD-ROM includes a multimedia introduction to the C\n   programming language and encourages the reader learn the basics of C\n   from the tutorial before going very far into Java.\n\nThis seemed odd at first, but after moving through the C tutorial it\n   really started to make sense. Learning C is a good foundation for Java\n   (and Objective-C). The C language isn't terribly obscure or complex;\n   it's a concise language that makes writing procedural code\n   straightforward. And in both Objective-C and Java, when you get down\n   to the level \"inside\" the objects you still must be able to program in\n   a traditional procedural fashion that's vey similar to standard C.\n\nWhat I discovered after learning some of the basics about C was that\n   Objective-C was a very simple step beyond standard C. Java has some\n   nice features and, one day, I will go back and try to learn it. Java's\n   wide assortment of class libraries, industry-wide acceptance\n   (including WebObjects), and garbage collection scheme make me curious\n   about whether it would be a better language to use. But for my\n   learning purposes, Objective-C was a very simple step forward. If you\n   already know Java, your decision will likely be different, but if you\n   are as new to \"real\" programming as I am, you may find that\n   Objective-C is the simpler path.\n\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nAt first, I resisted even writing this section. C isn't terribly\n   complicated and if you try to learn it on a \"need to know\" basis you\n   probably won't really be learning it but just checking items off on\n   your list.\n\nTo start though, you should learn how to write C, don't try to learn C\n   by reading other people's code. I learned lots of scripting languages\n   by reading samples and scripts of others, but this didn't work well\n   for C. After people get the hang of writing C, they start taking\n   shortcuts to make typing easier. When I was just starting out, I found\n   that I ended up doing more decoding of these examples than actual\n   learning. What was worse was that sometimes my decoding was wrong and\n   I'd end up very confused. You'll be much better off following a\n   tutorial and writing out your own code that is clear and\n   understandable.\n\nAs for the topics themselves: You should learn about the different\n   types of variables and how to change one into another when needed. You\n   should learn some of the basic string functions like printf, sscanf\n   and strcopy, but Cocoa includes a lot of great string manipulation so\n   there's not a need to get too in depth about string functions and\n   techniques. You should learn how to read and use the order of\n   operations table but it's probably not necessary to commit it to\n   memory. You should learn about the various types of loops (while, for,\n   and so on). You'll need to learn about some of the more advanced\n   structures like enums and structs. And you will need to learn what a\n   pointer is and how it's used is a good thing, though you probably\n   don't need to learn a great deal of pointer arithmetic or pointer\n   tricks.\n\nOne topic that you may not want to get into (that many introductory\n   courses cover) are the bit operations. Twiddling bits isn't something\n   that's you have to do in Cocoa (but you can if you want). But I found\n   the subject really helped me understand C better. Nevertheless, if\n   your goal is strictly Cocoa and calculating in base two makes your\n   head hurt, you're probably safe skipping the subject.\n\n\nReferences for Learning C\n\nLearning C takes some patience and attention. There are many books on\n   the shelves and there are a number of tutorials on the Web that will\n   help you.\n\nI recommend reading at least one of these books and doing the\n   suggested exercises in it to learn C. Personally, I used all of them\n   (in addition to some others I would not recommend), but that's mainly\n   because I like reading different writing styles and perspectives.\n\"The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition\"\n       By Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie (Prentice Hall)\n       ISBN: 0131103628 274 pages, $40.00\n\"Practical C Programming, 3rd Edition\"\n       By Steve Oualline (O'Reilly Publishing)\n       ISBN: 1-56592-306-5 451 pages, $34.95\n\"The Waite Group's C Primer Plus\"\n       By Stephen Prata (Sams)\n       ISBN: 1571691618 820 Pages, $29.99\n\nReviewing these books would be a huge undertaking itself, but here's\n   an unjust summary of their use to me. \"The C Programming Language\" is\n   the definitive guide to C but it can be a difficult introduction to\n   the language; if I had to get only one book this would be it though.\n   \"Practical C Programming\" gives some very good advice about C writing\n   style and how to avoid writing \"unreadable\" programs. And the \"The\n   Waite Group's C Primer Plus\" is very helpful if you aren't familiar\n   with programming in any form (AppleScript, FileMaker, Basic, etc). I'd\n   also suggest looking at some book review sites (like Amazon) for some\n   opinions of what other readers thought.\n\nI'd strongly recommend buying real books to learn from. There's\n   something about the editing and review process that made them more\n   useful and lucid to me than the tutorials available on the web. But if\n   money is a concern or you just want the convenience of having an\n   online reference, there are some tutorials available on the world wide\n   web.\nTom Torfs' \"An Introduction to C\"\n\nPaul Sheer's \"Trivial Introduction to C\" on Source Forge\n\nDaniel Thomasset's \"An instantaneous introduction to C\" at the\n       University of Kansas\n\nMarshall Brain's \"How C Programming Works\" on the How Stuff Works\n       site\n\nDave Marshall's \"Programming in C\" on the Cardiff University site\n\nSteve Summit's \"C Programming\" and \"Notes to accompany K and R\"\n\nAnand Mehta's \"A Crash Course in C\"\n\nRemy Saville's \"C Tutorial\" on the Programmer's Vault site\n\n\nA word of advice though, don't cheat by cutting and pasting code into\n   your practice programs. Just like your fourth grade math teacher\n   prohibited you from using a calculator to learn your multiplication\n   tables, you will learn C better by typing all of your code from\n   scratch for each and every exercise. It's a pain, but the mechanics of\n   the process is just as important as learning the logic. When you start\n   making programs over fifty or a hundred lines long, then you probably\n   will want to start taking typing shortcuts.\n\n\nDifferences from Scripting Languages\n\nComing from the world of Mac scripting, some of the conventions of C\n   were confusing for me. Here's a list of a few of them. They may or may\n   not make sense to you yet, but if at some point you get flustered or\n   confused someone else may have been there too.\n\nChoosing Sizes for Variables\nSome scripting languages make the user choose a type of variable\n       (number, text, date) but few require the user to pick how big to\n       make the variables. In C you must decide whether your variables\n       will hold small or big numbers, lengths of text, and other\n       \"sizing\" considerations. This can be flustering to a new\n       programmer, but don't overthink yourself when you're getting\n       started. \"I need to provide a variable to hold a name, but should\n       it be able to hold Susan O'Donnel or Marguerite Elizabeth\n       Wolverhampton-Morrell?\". If in doubt, choose something longer than\n       you need. When you get more adept at the language you can learn\n       how choosing the right size will help speed up your program and\n       not use as much memory. But learning how to optimize C is\n       definitely something you need to learn after learning basic C\n       programming.\nThere is no Symbol for Exponentiation\nIf you look at a table of the order operations will be performed\n       you will see the upper pointing caret '^' that's commonly used to\n       denote exponentiation. Don't be fooled: the caret really\n       represents a bit shifting operation (a very powerful but \"machine\n       level\" sort of operation). If you want to use exponents you'll\n       need to use a library such as math.h\nWhite Space Almost Doesn't Matter\nSome langauges like Python actually pay attention to the way you\n       indent your code. Some tools like FileMaker or Hypercard read your\n       code and put in the indentation that it wants based on what you've\n       written. The C compiler (as you will learn) doesn't care at all\n       about your indentation. Inded one of the things that can mess you\n       up is paying too much attention to the indentation and not enough\n       to what your code is actually saying. But even though the C\n       compiler doesn't care about your indentation, other things do. In\n       particular, the C preprocessor requires that some of it's\n       directives be written in certain places. If your #define macro\n       appears anywhere other than the start of a new line, there will be\n       an error.\nObjects are not All the Same\nSince you probably will only learn C to the extent that you will\n       start using it to learn other object-oriented programing\n       langauges, you might see reference made to objects and get\n       confused. Don't. In ANSI C the term object refers to the machine\n       code that's generated from the compiler just before the linking\n       stage. These files aren't readable by a human and they end in '.o'\n       (dot oh). Additionally, when you start getting into Objective C,\n       C++, and Java you may start reading things about objects that\n       don't fit with each other. You may share programming principles\n       between the different languages. You may even have different\n       \"langauge objects\" in your project, but they should be treated as\n       ghosts in their own planes of existence. But in general it's good\n       to think of objects seperate to their own context.\nAssignment is Just Another Operator\nLet X = X + 1 or Let Y = Y^Z + LOG (G) * SIN (T). In Applesoft\n       Basic, Excel, Hypercard, FileMaker and many other scripting\n       languages allow you to build very simple or elaborate assignment\n       statements, but the last thing which will always happen is the\n       assignment itself. In C, an assignment is just another operation\n       with a precedence just like addition, division, or parentheses.\n       This gives you the flexibility to do some crazy things with\n       assignments. It lets you put multiple assignments in an\n       expression. It lets you perform an assignment, perform more\n       operations, and then assign things to yet another expression. You\n       can even build a very elaborate set of operations and then forget\n       to actually assign the result to anything. Be careful.\nC Counts from Zero, not One\nThe short snippet of text \"Wretched\" is eight characters long. If\n       you want to take the first character of the string (in this case\n       'W') you would use an expression like =MID(A1,1,1) in Excel or\n       Middle(\"Wretched\",1,1) in FileMaker. In C, a similar expression\n       would get you the character 'r' because C doesn't count things\n       starting with one. In most cases it starts counting with 0. I\n       asked a real C programmer why this was. \"Isn't it more intuitive\n       to start counting at 1?\" \"Why would you want to waste a number?\"\n       \"Waste a number? isn't it arbitrary where the numbers start?\"\n       \"Nope. All types, signs, and sizes of variables include zero in\n       their range of acceptable values. If C started counting at one you\n       would loose the use of a whole digit.\" There may be other reasons\n       beyond what my friend told me, but generally C tries to do as\n       little as possible that would artificially limit the machine even\n       if it makes things a bit more complex for the programmer. That's a\n       very different mentality from scripting languages which go to\n       great ends to simplify the logic for the programmer. In truth,\n       this isn't as big a deal as it seemed it would be when I first\n       discovered this counting scheme, but it did take me a while to get\n       into that mindset. It may take you some time to do so as well.\n\nThat about wraps up this topic. Be sure to look at some of the other\n   tutorials for more information. In the meantime, get out there and\n   learn C. Good Luck!\n   Comments\n\nThank you for the information and guidance your article provides.\n\nC counts from zero rather than one because it's just an offset from\n   the base address of the array. Since the first element of array foo\n   begins at the base address, the offset is zero, so we write foo[0], or\n   *(foo+0), or *foo.\n\nThe next element is one away from the base address, so it is\n   referenced as foo[1], or *(foo+1).\n\nAnother excellent book on C is \"Expert C Programming,\" by Peter van\n   der Linden.\n\nIncidentally, Mr. van der Linden's \"Just Java\" book is a nice gentle\n   intro to Java, but it needs to be followed by the already-mentioned\n   \"Thinking In Java\" from Bruce Eckel, or at least the O'Reilly book\n   \"Java In A Nutshell\" by David Flanagan.\n\nJava is such a great language (once one understands the whole\n   CLASSPATH thing) because it's so easy to learn and to use (so it's\n   great as a first language), and it's plenty powerful for real-world\n   development.\n\nThat said, I use it only for server-side development. I never grokked\n   the GUI side, and the Java GUI apps I've run were both slow and\n   frustrating to use.\n\nI wrote a few C tutorials (\"Programming in C\" and \"Programming in ANSI\n   C\") many years ago. Next month (Dec. 2003), my Objective-C tutorial,\n   \"Programming in Objective-C\" will be released.\n\nI decided to teach the language from the ground up, that is, without\n   having the reader learn C first. I did this so that the programmer can\n   avoid learning procedural programming techniques before establishing a\n   good foundation with object-oriented programming. Just because\n   Objective-C is layered on C, it doesn't mean you have to learn C\n   first!\n\nAfter learning how to program in Objective-C and use the Foundation\n   classes (which I teach in the book), then I recommend the reader go\n   back and learn more of the details about C (such as arrays, functions,\n   and pointers). These are covered in the book, but you really don't\n   need to learn about them before you start writing Objective-C\n   programs.\n\nI will be curious to get feedback on whether my approach works."

        "articleBody": "Relations with the United States\n\nJapan-United States relations were more uncertain in the early 1990s\n   than at any time since World War II. As long-standing military allies\n   and increasingly interdependent economic partners, Japan and the\n   United States cooperated closely to build a strong, multifaceted\n   relationship based on democratic values and interests in world\n   stability and development. Japan-United States relations improved\n   enormously in the 1970s and 1980s, as the two societies and economies\n   became increasingly intertwined. In 1990 their combined gross national\n   product (GNP) totaled about one third of the world's GNP. Japan\n   received about 11 percent of United States exports (a larger share\n   than any other country except Canada), and the United States bought\n   about 34 percent of Japan's exports. Japan had US$148 billion in\n   direct investment in the United States in 1991, while the United\n   States had more than US$17 billion invested in Japan. Some US$100\n   billion in United States government securities held by institutions in\n   Japan helped finance much of the United States budget deficit.\n   Economic exchanges were reinforced by a variety of scientific,\n   technical, tourist, and other exchanges. Each society continued to see\n   the other as its main ally in Asia and the Pacific. Certain\n   developments in the late 1980s damaged bilateral relations.\n   Nevertheless, public opinion surveys continued to reveal that\n   substantial majorities of Japanese and Americans believed that the\n   bilateral relationship was vital to both countries.\n\nGrowing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing\n   circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created\n   a crisis in Japan-United States relations in the late 1980s. United\n   States government officials continued to emphasize the positive\n   aspects of the relationship but warned that there was a need for \"a\n   new conceptual framework.\" The Wall Street Journal publicized a series\n   of lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late\n   1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United\n   States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or\n   appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and\n   media opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on\n   US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with\n   preserving a close Japan-United States relationship. It warned of a\n   \"new orthodoxy\" of \"suspicion, criticism and considerable self-\n   justification,\" which it said was endangering the fabric of Japan-\n   United States relations.\n\nThree sets of factors stand out as the most important in explaining\n   the challenges facing Japan-United States relations. They are\n   economic, political-military, and domestic in nature.\n\nThe relative economic power of Japan and the United States was\n   undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went\n   well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with\n   Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion\n   annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and\n   budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the\n   middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of\n   Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency\n   gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to\n   make important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s,\n   Japan was the main international creditor.\n\nJapan's growing investment in the United States--it was the second\n   largest investor after Britain--led to complaints from some American\n   constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to\n   use its economic power to invest in the high- technology products in\n   which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United\n   States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many\n   Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and\n   business debt and a low savings rate.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe\n   and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal\n   political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United\n   States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the\n   Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize\n   the security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which\n   should have priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese\n   and United States officials and commentators continued to emphasize\n   the common dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the\n   continued strong Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that\n   until Moscow followed its moderation in Europe with major\n   demobilization and reductions in its forces positioned against the\n   United States and Japan in the Pacific, Washington and Tokyo needed to\n   remain militarily prepared and vigilant.\n\nIncreasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan- United\n   States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as\n   deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably\n   the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Ironically,\n   some United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep\n   Japan's potential military power in check and under the supervision of\n   the United States.\n\nThe post-Cold War environment strengthened the relative importance of\n   economic prowess over military power as the major source of world\n   influence in the early 1990s. This shift affected the perceived\n   relative standing of Japan, the United States, and other powers.\n   Increasingly, Japan was expected to shoulder international aid and\n   economic responsibilities that in the past were discharged by the\n   United States and other Western countries.\n\nThe declining Soviet threat, the rising power of the Japanese economy,\n   increasingly close United States interaction (and related disputes)\n   with Japan, and other factors led by 1990 to a decided shift in United\n   States opinion about Japan and to less marked but nonetheless notable\n   shifts in Japanese opinion. In the United States, this shift was\n   reflected in questions about which was the more serious, the military\n   threat from the Soviet Union or the economic challenge from Japan. In\n   a series of polls in 1989 and 1990, most respondents considered the\n   challenge from Japan the more serious. Similarly, poll data from early\n   1990 showed that most Japanese considered negative United States\n   attitudes toward Japan a reflection of United States anger at\n   \"America's slipping economic position.\" Meanwhile, Japanese opinion\n   was showing greater confidence in Japan's ability to handle its own\n   affairs without constant reference--as in the past--to the United\n   States. Japan's belief in United States reliability as a world leader\n   also lessened.\n\nIn both countries, new or \"revisionist\" views of the Japan- United\n   States relationship were promoted. In Japan some commentators argued\n   that the United States was weak, dependent on Japan, and unable to\n   come to terms with world economic competition. They urged Japan to\n   strike out on a more independent course. In the United States,\n   prominent commentators warned of a Japanese economic juggernaut, out\n   of control of the Japanese government, which needed to be \"contained\"\n   by the United States.\n\nAt the same time, it was easy to overstate the changes in opinion in\n   both countries. The Japanese still considered the United States\n   positively as their closest friend, the principal guardian of their\n   external security, their most important economic partner and market,\n   and the exemplar of a life-style that had much to offer--and much to\n   envy. Moreover, the vast majority of Americans still viewed Japan\n   positively, had high respect for Japanese accomplishments, and\n   supported the United States defense commitment to Japan.\n\nIn the years after World War II, Japan's relations with the United\n   States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end\n   of the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality,\n   the legal basis of which was laid down in the peace treaty signed by\n   forty-eight Allied nations and Japan, was initially largely nominal,\n   because in the early postoccupation period Japan required direct\n   United States economic assistance. A favorable Japanese balance of\n   payments with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a\n   result of United States military and aid spending in Japan.\n\nThe Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the\n   disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and\n   trade with the United States expanded. Self-confidence grew as the\n   country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining\n   economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for\n   greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s\n   and 1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese\n   attitude toward United States military bases on the four main islands\n   of Japan and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds\n   of the Ryukyu Islands.\n\nThe government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating\n   dissociation from the United States against the realities of the need\n   for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return\n   of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the\n   Ogasawara Islands), the United States as early as 1953 voluntarily\n   relinquished its control of the Amami group of islands at the northern\n   end of the Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to\n   return Okinawa, which was then under United States military\n   administration for an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of\n   the peace treaty. Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous\n   resolution adopted by the Diet in June 1956, calling for a return of\n   Okinawa to Japan.\n\nBilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and\n   the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in\n   Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the\n   Diet for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter\n   debate over the Japan-United States relationship and the occasion for\n   violence in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its\n   passage. It was finally approved by the House of Representatives on\n   May 20. Japan Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house\n   session and tried to prevent the LDP deputies from entering the\n   chamber; they were forcibly removed by the police. Massive\n   demonstrations and rioting by students and trade unions followed.\n   These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit to Japan by President\n   Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the resignation of Prime\n   Minister Kishi Nobusuke, but not before the treaty was passed by\n   default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed to vote on\n   the issue within the required thirty days after lower house approval.\n\nUnder the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each\n   other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese\n   administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come\n   to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally\n   forbidden to send armed forces overseas. In particular, the\n   constitution forbids the maintenance of \"land, sea, and air forces.\"\n   It also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \"the threat or\n   use of force as a means of settling international disputes\".\n   Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their\n   \"self-defense\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping purposes.) The\n   scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu Islands, but an\n   appended minute made clear that in case of an armed attack on the\n   islands, both governments would consult and take appropriate action.\n   Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior consultation between\n   the two governments before any major change occurred in the deployment\n   of United States troops or equipment in Japan. Unlike the 1952\n   security pact, the new treaty provided for a ten-year term, after\n   which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by either party. The\n   treaty included general provisions on the further development of\n   international cooperation and on improved future economic cooperation.\n\nBoth countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise,\n   under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese\n   territories acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968 the\n   United States returned the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima) to\n   Japanese administration control. In 1969 the Okinawa reversion issue\n   and Japan's security ties with the United States became the focal\n   points of partisan political campaigns. The situation calmed\n   considerably when Prime Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in\n   November 1969, and in a joint communiqu signed by him and President\n   Richard M. Nixon, announced the United States agreement to return\n   Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June 1971, after eighteen months of\n   negotiations, the two countries signed an agreement providing for the\n   return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.\n\nThe Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the\n   security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question\n   meant that, two major political issues in Japan-United States\n   relations were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the\n   Japanese government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of\n   his forthcoming visit to the People's Republic of China. Many Japanese\n   were chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in\n   advance with Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign\n   policy. The following month, the government was again surprised to\n   learn that, without prior consultation, the United States had imposed\n   a 10 percent surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder\n   Japan's exports to the United States. Relations between Tokyo and\n   Washington were further strained by the monetary crisis involving the\n   December 1971 revaluation of the Japanese yen.\n\nThese events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in relations,\n   a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was not\n   without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres,\n   although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues\n   between the two countries were essentially security-related and\n   derived from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to\n   contribute more to its own defense and to regional security. The\n   economic issues tended to stem from the ever-widening United States\n   trade and payments deficits with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan\n   reversed its imbalance in trade with the United States and, for the\n   first time, achieved an export surplus.\n\nThe United States withdrawal from Indochina in 1975 and the end of the\n   Second Indochina War meant that the question of Japan's role in the\n   security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became\n   central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. United\n   States dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface\n   in 1975 when Secretary of Defense James A. Schlesinger publicly\n   stigmatized Japan as a passive defense partner.\n\nUnited States pressures continued and intensified, particularly as\n   events in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East after 1979 caused the\n   United States to relocate more than 50 percent of its naval strength\n   from East Asian waters to the Indian Ocean. Japan was repeatedly\n   pressed not only to increase its defense expenditures and build up its\n   antisubmarine and naval patrol capabilities but also to play a more\n   active and positive security role generally.\n\nThe Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations and\n   strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for a\n   more rapid buildup of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). It steadily\n   increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and\n   indicated its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining\n   the United States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States\n   and Japan formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation,\n   in the framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee\n   provided for under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in\n   turn, drew up new Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense\n   Cooperation, under which military planners of the two countries have\n   conducted studies relating to joint military action in the event of an\n   armed attack on Japan.\n\nOn the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by\n   agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on\n   products whose influx into the United States was creating political\n   problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese\n   color television exports to the United States was signed, following\n   the pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel\n   exports to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems\n   continued as disputes flared over United States restrictions on\n   Japanese development of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities,\n   Japanese restrictions on certain agricultural imports, such as beef\n   and oranges, and liberalization of capital investment and government\n   procurement within Japan.\n\nTo respond to the call, from its allies and from within the country as\n   well, for a greater and more responsible role in the world, Japan\n   developed what Ohira Masayoshi, after he became prime minister in\n   December 1978, called a \"comprehensive security and defense strategy\n   to safeguard peace.\" Under this policy, Japan sought to place its\n   relations with the United States on a new footing--one of close\n   cooperation but on a more reciprocal and autonomous basis, and on a\n   global scale.\n\nThis policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical\n   Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty\n   hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of\n   international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil\n   companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available\n   when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action\n   brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government\n   \"insensitivity\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a Japanese\n   apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran in\n   concert with other United States allies.\n\nFollowing that incident, the Japanese government took greater care to\n   support United States international policies designed to preserve\n   stability and promote prosperity. Japan was prompt and effective in\n   announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union\n   following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In\n   1981, in response to United States requests, it accepted greater\n   responsibility for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater\n   support for United States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady\n   buildup of the SDF.\n\nA qualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world\n   affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime\n   Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Officials of the Ronald Reagan\n   administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to\n   develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their\n   common security and international outlook. Nakasone reassured United\n   States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat,\n   closely coordinated policies with the United States toward such Asian\n   trouble spots as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked\n   cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The\n   Japanese government welcomed the increase of United States forces in\n   Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the\n   SDF, and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States\n   against the threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued\n   to cooperate closely with United States policy in these areas\n   following Nakasone's term of office, although the political leadership\n   scandals in Japan in the late 1980s made it difficult for newly\n   elected President George Bush to establish the same kind of close\n   personal ties that marked the Reagan years.\n\nA specific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United States\n   included its quick response to the United States call for greater host\n   nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of\n   Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s. The currency\n   realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan,\n   which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing\n   to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness\n   to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to\n   countries considered of strategic importance to the West. During the\n   1980s, United States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's\n   \"strategic aid\" to countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and\n   Jamaica. Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's pledges of support for East\n   European and Middle Eastern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of\n   Japan's willingness to share greater responsibility for world\n   stability.\n\nDespite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the\n   Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States\n   policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from\n   large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were\n   seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of\n   course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation.\n   Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect\n   tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) was\n   subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the\n   positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because\n   of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the\n   construction of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing\n   greater host nation support for United States forces in Japan, and\n   providing loans to Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to join even in a\n   mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an indication to some\n   United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to cooperate with the\n   United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese leaders at home or\n   abroad.\n\nThe main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s\n   was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan\n   to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic\n   practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. A\n   common pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to\n   political pressures from important domestic constituencies that would\n   be hurt by greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of\n   two types--those representing inefficient or \"declining\" producers,\n   manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if faced with\n   full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries that the\n   Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition until\n   they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with domestic\n   pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States, the\n   Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic\n   bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new\n   industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some\n   aspects of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic\n   issues to be dragged out in talks over several years, involving more\n   than one market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes\n   vague and subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the\n   United States.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, United States administrations had favored\n   an issue-by-issue approach in negotiating such economic disputes with\n   Japan. This approach ostensibly limited the areas of dispute. But it\n   resulted in widespread negative publicity, at a time when changing\n   economic and security circumstances were causing both countries to\n   reevaluate the relationship. Notable outpourings of United States\n   congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the\n   disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated\n   machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which\n   reportedly allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid\n   United States detection, and the United States congressional debate in\n   1989 over the Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter\n   aircraft--the FSX--for Japan's Air Self- Defense Force.\n\nA new approach was added in 1989. The so-called Structural Impediments\n   Initiative was a series of talks designed to deal with domestic\n   structural problems limiting trade on both sides. After several rounds\n   of often contentious talks, agreements were reached in April and July\n   1990 that promised major changes in such sensitive areas as Japanese\n   retailing practices, land use, and investment in public works. The\n   United States pledged to deal more effectively with its budget deficit\n   and to increase domestic savings. United States supporters saw the\n   Structural Impediments Initiative talks as addressing fundamental\n   causes of Japan-United States economic friction. Skeptics pointed to\n   them as ways for officials to buy time and avoid an acute crisis in\n   Japan-United States relations. The Bill Clinton administration decided\n   to end the Structural Impediments Initiative in the summer of 1993 as\n   a framework for dealing with United States-Japan bilateral relations."

Upon receiving this\n   suggestion I must confess I met with two contradictory feelings. On\n   the one hand, I was pleased and even also somewhat proud; I felt glad\n   indeed if I could in any way bring a contribution to young Indian\n   students, as being myself a Westerner with a very great moral and\n   spiritual debt towards Mother India, at least and at last I could\n   perhaps do something useful towards Her and her children.\n\n       On the other end, I felt somewhat reluctant because writing such\n   an article meant inevitably speaking at length about myself, which I\n   do hate and find utterly repellent. Even in French we use to say:  le\n   moi est hassable , i.e.  The I is detestable . And I was deeply\n   aware of that long before I read the famous words from the\n   Bhagavatpaada:\n   manobuddhyaha.nkaarachittaani naahaM.\n   But after pondering carefully over the subject the first feeling\n   overcame the second, and here follows my small article (at least I\n   shall try to make it short in spite of an inborn tendency to be often\n   quite talkative and prone to unending comments). I shall make it in\n   three parts:\n   I. My condition as a heavily disabled person\n   II. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma\n   III. My interest in the IITM software\n\n    I. My condition as a heavily disabled person\n\n       I was fortunate enough not to be born disabled nor did it happen\n   during my childhood, which thanks to the Gods was very healthy and\n   happy, apart from the fact that my father died when I was very young,\n   only just more than 10 year old, which had very crucial and long\n   lasting consequences for the rest of my life.\n\n       Now aged 55, my handicap came totally unexpectedly a few days\n   before my 49th birthday in the end of 1994, when all of a sudden as a\n   result of overwork, strain and stress (I was the Managing Director of\n   a medium-sized company and did not hesitate during several years in\n   very difficult business circumstances to work for 14 and to 16 hour a\n   day) I had a brain infarct, which resulted in a stroke of hemiplegia\n   and I remained paralysed on the left side of my body. In one way, I\n   was rather fortunate and blessed by the Gods that, first I did not die\n   on the spot, or during the first three following days, which is often\n   the case, and second that the accident took place in the right side of\n   my brain, thus affecting the left side of my body; should had it been\n   the reverse, I should have lost speech and my hand-writing capability,\n   a full disaster for me who happen to be a right-handed person. After\n   six months of highly dedicated rehabilitation in a physiotherapy\n   clinic, with a lot of will, endurance and determination I could\n   recover pretty well but not enough to be able to take up my old job\n   again. I was dismissed by my company in 1995 and was declared an\n   invalid by the French Social Security. Since then I am so to say a\n   kind of person in early retirement.\n\n       Unfortunately in 1995 and 1997 I experienced some more health\n   problems in my brain that more or less ruined the good recovery I had\n   reached before those complications. In any case, I can walk just a\n   little inside my home with the help of a walking stick and am not\n   compelled to spend the whole day sitting on my wheelchair. The biggest\n   problem for me comes from my left hand that is now virtually dead.\n   Prior to my accident I was very excellent indeed at typing on a\n   keyboard, having learnt at school during my commercial studies, and\n   using professionally and rapidly all my ten fingers from both hands.\n   Now I can type with only three fingers of my right hand.\n\n   II. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma\n\n       Born in France, (in a family native of Alsace near the German\n   border, why my name does not sound typically French, like Dupont or\n   Durand), just after Worl War II, in late November 1945, I had always\n   been a very religious boy, but when I reached 14, I could no longer\n   remain satisfied with the creeds, beliefs and practices of the Roman\n   Catholic Church, in which I had been being born and educated. These\n   did not appear to me  catholic  enough, as this word should\n   originally mean  universal . One day, about November 1960 (i.e. aged\n   more or less exactly 15), while looking at random at books in a\n   bookshop that I used to visit quite often (in Paris where I was born\n   and living at that time), I started to turn over, just by a stroke of\n   luck, the pages of the French translation of  Jna Yoga  of Svm\n   Viveknanda, and was seized with wonder seeing that the book included\n   two chapters on a universal religion. I felt this was exactly what I\n   was longing for, and I bought the book immediately and read it eagerly\n   from cover to cover: I was overwhelmed with joy and wanted to know\n   more. After reading  Jna Yoga   several times, I wanted to know\n   also about S'r Rmakrishna. I started to look for further literature\n   on the Paramahamsa, and in a rather small booklet learnt at last that\n   there existed one Rmakrishna Vednta Centre in France. I got the\n   address from the Indian Embassy in Paris. All these investigations had\n   of course taken some time, and it was only in early May 1961 (it was\n   thus exactly 40 years on the 4th of May 2001), aged 15 year and a\n   half, that I first visited the French Rmakrishna Vednta Centre in\n   Gretz.There, I came fortunately very rapidly into a tight and friendly\n   relationship with a brahmcri, disciple of the late Svm\n   Siddhes'varnanda, who had founded the Centre in 1937 in Paris, and\n   had then established it in Gretz in 1947. Unfortunately he had passed\n   away 4 years earlier, in beginning April 1957 and I could not meet him\n   personally. Svm Siddhes'varnanda was himself a disciple of Svm\n   Brahmnanda, a direct disciple of S'r Rmakrishna, appearing often in\n   the so-called  Gospel  (I do not like the use of this Christian name\n   and prefer to stick to the original tittle  Kathmrita : Svm\n   Brahmnanda was Rkhl, in the inner circle of young disciples, and\n   later he became the President of the Math and Mission). I became\n   fortunately very rapidly an enthusiastic student of the\n   above-mentioned brahmcri.\n   My main subject of study with my Vednta teacher (apart from the\n   teachings of Paramahamsa S'r Rmakrishna) was avasthtraya vicra as\n   taught to Svm Siddhes'varnanda by his own teacher in philosophy\n   S'r V. Subrahmania Iyer, a prominent philosopher of the XXth century\n   (reader in Philosophy of the Mahrja of Mysore) and himself (S'r\n   Iyer) a disciple of His Holiness S'r Saccidnanda S'ivbhinava\n   Narasimha Bharat Mahasvm, Jagadguru of S'ringeri from 1878 to 1912.\n\n       Svm Siddhes'varnanda always insisted on the fact that exactly\n   as one needs two legs for walking or two hands for working (I\n   experience myself this point every day more painfully than anybody\n   else), we need, in this age, for our spiritual life to harmonise the\n   teachings of S'r Rmakrishna and the pure Vednta of S'ankara as\n   taught by the above-mentioned Jagadguru of S'ringeri to S'r\n   Subrahmania Iyer, and mainly emphasizing avasthtraya vicra, the\n   major and unique contribution of the Indian philosophy to the\n   universal philosophy, most of the other aspects of the Indian\n   philosophy or theology having already more or less their equivalent or\n   counterpart in the Western thought. That is what I dedicated my life\n   to.\n\n       Apart from a repeated study of the Bhagavad Gt and of course all\n   major Upanishads I had a special interest for the mANDUkyakArikA of\n   GauDaPAda, which deals only with the avastha-s.\n\n       Also, I read again and again and studied very carefully, and even\n   translated in parts  VEDNTA, OR THE SCIENCE OF REALITY  of S'r\n   K.A. Krishnasvami Iyer.\n\n       Having also studied all four volumes of THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF\n   INDIA, published by the RAMAKRISHNA INSTITUTE OF CULTURE, I translated\n   into French the two articles from volume III:\n   THE ESSENTIALS OF VEDANTA by S'r V. Subrahmania Iyer and\n   PHILOSOPHY OF ADVAITA by S'r K.A. Krishnasvami Iyer\n\n       I also translated into French\n   MAN'S INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY by S'r V. Subrahmania Iyer first\n   published in 1936 by Messrs Allen and Unwin in  CONTEMPORARY INDIAN\n   PHILOSOPHY  edited by S. Radhakrishnan and J.H. Muirhead in the\n   Muirhead Library of Philosophy and also later included in  THE\n   PHILOSOPHY OF TRUTH OR TATTVAGNANA  a collection of speeches and\n   writings by Sri V. Subrahmania Iyer edited by Dr T.M.P. MAHADEVAN,\n   Department of Philosophy, University of Madras, 1955, upon request of\n   S'r Iyer's family.\n\n       But none of these translations have been published so far. I shall\n   hand them to my sons who shall make a good use of it, I feel sure.\n   (more in  III.)\n\n       As my father had passed away when I was only a little more than 10\n   year old, and that we were not rich people, I could not afford long\n   academic studies (quite attracted by languages, I should have felt\n   inclined to study Sanskrit at the University, along with Bengali, to\n   be able to read the S'r Rmakrishna Kathmrita in the original\n   language, and possibly translate it into French), but instead I had to\n   start earning my living just after finishing my military training.\n\n       Thus, slightly over 20 equipped only with basic occupational\n   commercial studies acquired before my military training (from 15 to\n   19), I started a nearly 30-year long career with the Swedish Paper\n   Industry, first as a local salesman, then as the Managing Director of\n   3 different Sales Companies. Instead of Sanskrit and Bengali, I learnt\n   Swedish, which I talk and write just about as fluently as French.\n\n       Although not properly a translator, I had to do a lot of\n   translations from Swedish and English into French, and hence also\n   devoted much of my vacant time to  translation studies  to become as\n   proficient as ever possible on the subject, which also helped me to a\n   large extent for my subsequent Vedantic translations.\n\n       From 1970 to 1981, then still living in Paris, I delivered 104\n   lectures, mostly on Indian philosophy and other aspects of the\n   Santana Dharma. I am extremely afflicted not to have been blessed by\n   the DIVINE MOTHER to reach the sacred number of 108, but with HER help\n   and blessings I shall try again to make it in my next life!\n\n       My professional life was very successful but in 1994, there were a\n   many problems in my Mother Company in Sweden, because of mergers. I\n   was chosen as the Manager for the new French Sales Company resulting\n   from the merger, but this meant a lot of overwork and additional\n   strain, which resulted in the stroke of hemiplegia mentioned in the \n   I, which left me paralysed on my left side (in the beginning of\n   November 1994, 3 weeks exactly before my 49th birthday). In my medical\n   ignorance, I felt pretty sure that problems with brain arteries were\n   always more or less related to cholesterol and arteriosclerosis, and\n   as I had never had any of these, and although a businessman had tried\n   to have a very hygienic way of life, I felt myself somewhat well\n   protected or immune against such problems and I did not hesitate to\n   work more than I should have done. I really had even become what is\n   termed in the U.S., I have heard, a  workaholic . It was only in the\n   hospital that the doctors explained to me that overwork, overtax and\n   stress may as well provoke a  brain infarct  as the most commonly\n   known  heart infarct , all the more as in my case, the  infarct \n   was not a thrombosis (but I do not want to indulge into too many\n   medical details, out of the subject, and for which I do not know all\n   the necessary technical vocabulary in English). Besides, I may have\n   been suffering, without knowing it, of a kind of hereditary weakness\n   of the brain arteries' walls.\n\n       As already said, prior to my stroke, I had quite an excellent\n   typing, very rapid too and highly qualified. But it's now all gone, my\n   left hand being almost dead, and I type with only one or two fingers\n   of my right hand. This is why my e-mail postings take (or at least\n   used to take?) such a long time and are (were?) often full of typing\n   errors.\n\n       Normally, I try to read and read again chasing for these typos\n   prior to sending e-mails. But first, there are always some typos that\n   escape and second, it always gives me the occasion for a further\n   digression, as new ideas are coming while reading and my messages,\n   letters or texts use to become longer and longer with every attempt to\n   get rid of typing errors.\n\n       But in March 2001 I bought a new computer and at the same time I\n   invested in a speech recognition software, which works in French as\n   well as in English and with the help of which I can now dictate my\n   correspondence in both languages, as well as do my captivating\n   translation work. The system runs very well and it is indeed one of\n   the very good achievements of the information technology. And as a\n   consequence, I do hope that a part of the above problems with typos\n   will be eradicated in the future.\n\n       Moreover, instead of typing I can now dictate my translations or\n   the articles I intend to write, which is quite comfortable. Now if the\n   voice recognition software normally does not make typos, it only\n   recognises the sounds that reach the microphone and not the words nor\n   their meaning; the machine does not understand you but only transfers\n   on the screen the sounds it has received, including noises from the\n   environment, which sometimes results in other types of errors very\n   often quite unexpected and sometimes jocular. But this is quite\n   another story. Anyway this digression leads me smoothly to the third\n   part of my article.\n\n   III. My interest in the IITM software :\n\n       As soon as it became obvious to me that my professional life was\n   over and that in this respect I had become socially an invalid or an\n   early retired person, I decided to devote all my time and efforts to\n   the topics that had been in the centre of all my life (even if at\n   times in the background because of my job) Sanskrit and Vednta.\n\n       If I had started to learn some Sanskrit already when I was 15, as\n   a fact I never went farther than some rudiments or basics and always\n   remained a kind of eternal beginner. To be frank I had strictly no\n   interest in learning such enlightening phrases like \"Rma sees the two\n   elephants\". What I wanted was to be able to translate very accurately\n   the few verses from the Bhagavad Gt or the texts from S'r\n   S'ankarcarya that I was quoting and commenting in my own lectures.\n\n       Thus I decided to start afresh my studies of the Sanskrit language\n   in a very serious way this time; and with the development of the\n   information technology and the Internet, there now exists very\n   fascinating and facilitative possibilities that did not exist when I\n   was only 15.\n\n       Moreover I have not the pretence, ambition nor conceitedness to\n   write my Complete Works. But when preparing the already mentioned 104\n   lectures that I delivered in Paris, I have accumulated such a huge\n   documentation that I have a lot of material available for writing\n   articles on several aspects of the Santana Dharma and quite\n   especially on Vednta and my favourite subject viz avasthtraya\n   vicra.\n\n       Married in 1974, my wife and I have two sons now aged 25 and 23\n   who are studying and preparing themselves for the highest posts in the\n   University. The eldest one is studying History and the youngest one\n   Philosophy. When they have finished their studies, if my health is\n   still permitting, and with the blessings of the DIVINE MOTHER, we\n   intend to write all three of us a book on \"some aspects of Vednta in\n   the XXth-century\". In the meantime as they have of course quite a lot\n   of other subjects to prioritise, I have started writing some articles\n   based on the archives I have available here. And this is where the\n   IITM software is proving extremely useful to me. Although I try not to\n   overdo it with them, those articles (or a few other translations I am\n   continuing to do on the subject and some of which might have their\n   place in the main dissertation) often include quotations or footnotes\n   with Sanskrit words or sloka-s. It is obvious that most Westerners\n   cannot the Sanskrit language, but I prefer in any case to supply the\n   Sanskrit text for some translated sloka-s so that the readers can at\n   least recognise the words. This being the case, it is of utmost\n   importance to cite the aforesaid quotations in diacriticised Roman\n   transliteration. But I have decided as a personal discipline as a well\n   as an introduction to the Sanskrit language for my sons to show the\n   text also in devangar. And in this respect the IITM software is\n   really unparalleled. Of course in the beginning things were not very\n   easy for me, all the more as -as far as computers are concerned- I am\n   only an average user and not at all a specialist of the information\n   technology. But Dr R. Kalyanakrishnan spared no effort to help me and\n   to facilitate things for me (even at the expense of explaining very\n   basic details that I should have known, or reminding me some other\n   ones I had known (when starting the computerisation of my firm) but\n   had later forgotten), and I really feel very indebted and grateful to\n   him for all what he has done in this respect.\n\n       I came into contact with Dr Kalyanakrishnan upon suggestion of\n   S'r N. Krishnaswamy of Vidya Vrikshah whom I had got in touch with as\n   to a translation of the maaNDuukyakarikaa, which is as the reader will\n   have understood of the highest importance for me.\n\n       Thus the parts of the IITM software that are of special and main\n   interest to me are the ones that refer to Sanskrit and I.P.A.\n   transliteration. The transliteration into other Indian languages is\n   less primary to me although useful at times for other purposes. As a\n   fact I have some Hindu friends in what was until recently West Bengal,\n   in Kerala and also in Karnataka, and when writing to them by now I\n   always try to write their first names in their own languages, Bangla,\n   Kannada or Malaylam. This is only a small sign of friendship: they\n   know I cannot their language and do not intend to learn it either. But\n   I shall never speak Sanskrit with anybody either at least in this\n   life! My purpose is not to be able to buy milk in Sanskrit (as the\n   CD-ROMs released last year by Samskrita Bhrati would like me to be\n   able to do). My very limited and egoistic aim is nothing but to try to\n   read, understand correctly and if possible translate accurately into\n   French just a few jewels of the Scriptures, of S'r S'a.nkara's\n   bhshya-s and of the Krik-s. Should I succeed in doing that, it\n   should actually be quite enough for this life.\n   mailto:guy.werlings@wanadoo.fr"

The average\n   consumer will spend around $700 this year on gifts; by making only the\n   minimum payment on that $700 at an interest rate of 18% you could take\n   up to 118 months (that's nearly 10 years) to pay off the debt and pay\n   an estimated $665 in interest.\n\nIf you are unable to pay your balance in full, you can avoid holiday\n   hangover and get your holiday bills paid off sooner by calling your\n   credit card company and asking them to lower your credit card interest\n   rate.\n\nGift Cards May Not Be The Perfect Gift\n\nGift cards can be a great gift for someone who is hard to buy for, or\n   for whom shipping gifts is expensive or impractical.

        "articleBody": "How A Local Church Can Have A Global Presence Through Cybermissions  \n\n   Summary: How your church can have a volunteer team of\n   cyber-missionaries that can minister cross-culturally to unreached\n   peoples at a total cost of between $1000 to $5000 a year and see\n   between 100 and 1100 decisions for Christ in that people group. \n\n   Cybermissions - is the front-line use of the Internet for\n   cross-cultural evangelism, discipleship, church-planting and training.\n\nSome Statistics\n\n   Worldwide Internet Population:\n\n   445.9 million (eMarketer)\n\n   533 million (Computer Industry Almanac)\n\n   Projection for 2004:\n\n   709.1 million (eMarketer)\n\n   945 million (Computer Industry Almanac)\n\n   Online Language Populations (September 2002)\n\n   From the above statistics it is clear that the Internet is no longer\n   predominantly an English speaking medium and that Asian languages such\n   as Chinese, Japanese and Korean now occupy a significant portion of\n   cyber-space along with major European languages such as Spanish.,\n   Portuguese and French.\n\n   There are over 275 million Internet searches each day and 80% of all\n   Internet sessions begin at a search engine (Internetstatistics.com).\n   Religion is one of the main topics people search for. Pew Internet\n   surveys found that 28 million Americans get religion information\n   online, that three million do so daily, and that 25 % of net users\n   search for religion-related topics. Barna Research estimates that up\n   to 50 million Americans may worship solely over the Internet by 2010.\n   There is every indication that the Internet is a major source of\n   religious information where people of many cultures and languages\n   collect their spiritual facts and opinions in private. Thus it's a\n   place where missionaries must be.\n\nWhat Is The Role Of A Local Church?\n\n   Local churches can create a Cybermissions Project Team (CPT) that uses\n   the church website, chat rooms and email to reach a specific ethnic\n   group for Christ. A well-run cybermissions website can see three\n   people a day or about 1100 people a year make commitments to Jesus as\n   Lord and Savior.\n\n   This is because the website is a \"perpetual evangelist\" that works\n   away 24/7 witnessing to seekers about Christ. The Internet is\n   seeker-driven. People using the Internet are seeking information via\n   search engines and links on other sites. When people arrive at your\n   website its not an accident. They have typed a query into a search\n   engine and arrived there. People not interested in God simply don't\n   arrive at your church website - they end up somewhere else, reading\n   the weather or the news. So virtually 100% of the people you minister\n   to will already have some level of interest. This makes evangelism so\n   much easier! You can witness, via the Internet 24/7 to people who are\n   already interested in finding out about God!\n\nOK  how do I start?\n\n   1.  Form a small group of say 6 to 8 people which should include a few\n   \"techie\" computer types, a few \"bible\" types and someone with\n   enthusiasm for missions.The pastor does not need to lead the group,\n   he/she can just give it some guidelines and get a monthly report. The\n   group should be led by someone with a passion for missions on the\n   Internet. The group can fit into the church structure in a similar way\n   to creative ministry teams.\n\n   2. Read the articles on cybermissions at http://www.aibi.ph/missions/\n   for some ideas to get you started.\n\n   3.  Get some web space. You need a domain name \"yourchurch.com\" and\n   some space on a server. We use ChristianWebHost.com and have found\n   them to be both affordable and reliable.\n\n   4. Pray about what people group you should be ministering to. For a\n   list of the 43 nations most suitable for a cybermissions strategy\n   click here. Then go to our mission links site and do some research on\n   your chosen nation at any of the mission portal sites listed there e.g\n   strategicnetwork.org.\n\n   5. Decide on an initial strategy (you can tweak it later) and start\n   designing the website. Use the articles in point 2 above for some\n   ideas.\n\n   6. Spend at least four hours a week working on the website and\n   improving it.\n\n   7. Reply to the emails that come in promptly and start ministering to\n   people in your target group.\n\n   8. Become a member of Cybermissions.Org and hang out with other people\n   doing the same thing - its free. (Cybermissions.Org will open\n   officially on 12th August 2003 as a web portal for cybermissionaries.)\n\nHow Much Does Running A Cybermissions Project Team Cost?\n\n   You will probably pay around $19.95 a year for the domain name.\n\n   Then around $10 a month for reliable ad-free hosting and $29.95 a\n   month for broadband access at your home or church office. ($480 per\n   annum)\n\n   Then work on replacing a computer every two years so - $1000 p.a.\n\n   Then maybe you want some expensive software - $1500 a year\n\n   And you do some online advertising at $150 a month - $1800\n\n   Total costs = $4800 per annum. Or around $5000 per annum for a\n   well-equipped active evangelistic outreach that may well bring between\n   100 to 1100 people to Christ.\n\nOn A Shoe-String Budget?\n\n   You can start for  $1000 per annum, $500 for the basics, (website,\n   domain name, broadband) and $500 for extras. For good free open-source\n   software go to http://www.sourceforge.net\n\nWhat Sort Of Things Can The CPT Do?\n\n     * Share testimonies in the target group's language.\n     * Have a chat room/bulletin board\n     * Have a pen-pals page\n     * Have a \"pray for healing\" page so they can ask the church to pray\n       for sick relatives.\n     * Have cross-over articles say on an area of secular interest (say\n       camel-racing if you want to reach Saudi Arabia) then tag a short\n       Christian message at the end or a link to an evangelistic page.\n     * Address the spiritual questions they have: demon-possession,\n       sacrifices to idols, magic, how to endure suffering, who is really\n       God, etc\n     * Online artwork that is culturally appropriate.\n     * Christian songs in their national language.\n     * Recipes for the favorite foods of the target people group.\n     * Have a \"personal advice\" column and articles on family life,\n       relationships, loneliness etc.\n     * Share bible portions, tracts and brief evangelistic sermons.\n     * Have news and weather of that country.\n     * Have a membership section so they keep coming back.\n\nWho Can We Contact For Help and Advice?\n\n   Contact John Edmiston at johned@aibi.ph - I've been doing this since\n   1991, and I'd love to help."

        "articleBody": "The Daily Ablution\n\n\"Washing brains since 2003\"\n\nPelling Pounds Pedant into Submission\n\n   I am aware that I sound pedantic at times, and I do apologise for that\n   (while I'm at it, I'll also apologise for my use of British spelling,\n   which I've adopted mainly to annoy two specific readers, who know who\n   they are). In my defence, I can only point to a constitutional\n   inablility to resist commenting on the mistakes, inaccuracy and poor\n   writing that I see almost daily in the press.\n\n   Take the work of Rowan Pelling, for example. She's apparently quite\n   well known over here, though I had never heard of her until I recently\n   started reading the Independent (because I'm lazy, and there's so much\n   easy grist in its pages).\n\n   Since I've first become aware of her - through noting with amusement\n   her ignorant misuse of the word \"gainsay\" - I've learned that she is\n   in fact past editor of something called the Erotic Review, which\n   purports to bring erotic writing to the intelligentsia. More recently,\n   she's been pressed into service as a judge of the prestigious Booker\n   Prize for literature, as she repeatedly reminded us this summer.\n\n   Incidentally, the first of those last three links is almost worth the\n   1 it costs to access. In it, Pelling complains of suffering from\n   \"judges' tristesse\" - a depression, tinged with guilt, that afflicts\n   literary prize givers after they make an award. In Rowan's case, the\n   tristesse was particularly bad, since she was the very, very most\n   important judge of all - the \"Florida\" of judges, as she put it\n   (referring to that state's role in the 2000 US elections).\n\n   I admit to wondering what she was going to write about once the Booker\n   had been awarded, given the frequency with which she addressed that\n   topic (and, more importantly, her role as judge). In fact, I was\n   afraid that the tristesse would weigh so heavily upon her that she'd\n   be forced to give up writing entirely.\n\n   Thankfully I needn't have worried - she reappears in the pages of\n   yesterday's Evening Standard, having secured a job reviewing Love for\n   Sale: A Global History of Prostitution. The post-Booker Pelling has\n   lost none of her punch, and she mercilessly hits the reader with one\n   shot after another.\n\n   Wasting no time, she lets us have it right from the opening bell, with\n   a couple of glancing jabs:\n\n   \"Legend has it that the Innuits have several hundred words for\n   snow.\"\n\n   Since she at least says \"legend has it,\" the opening combination isn't\n   terribly painful - though including as it does the jarring variant\n   spelling \"Innuits,\" it does impart a bit of a sting.\n\n   But the opening jabs soften us up for this:\n\n     \"In the Hindu kingdoms of India in the last centuries BC, there\n     were more than 300 different Sanskrit words for prostitute. I\n     suppose that amply illustrates the cultural differences between\n     people of hot and cold climes.\"\n\n   Of course, it illustrates exactly nothing at all, not least because\n   the first half of the comparison is so completely spurious. Nils\n   Ringal, author of the book being reviewed, will no doubt be irritated\n   that his factual nugget is sullied by the juxtaposition with one\n   that's been so frequently debunked.\n\n   Second paragraph. The hapless reader is hit with:\n\n     \"Ringal's comprehensive study of turning tricks is equally\n     compelling in its broader picture, whisking the reader from the\n     temple prostitutes of Mesopotamia to the New York Mayfair Madam\n     ...\"\n\n   Who is this 'Mayfair Madam', one wonders? Ms. Pelling, like her\n   headline writer, seems to think that we'll all get the reference, but\n   I've never heard of her. Either I don't know enough about prostitutes,\n   or Rowan is inaccurately referring to the Mayflower Madam, who was all\n   over the New York papers in the mid-80s.\n\n   Although it's distressing to imagine the former Erotic Review editor\n   making such an error, it is again no knockout punch in and of itself -\n   but we're feeling just a tad woozy so early into the column.\n\n   Third paragraph:\n\n     \"He points out that Polynesian women, for example, have almost no\n     concept of selling their favours when they can bestow them freely\n     where they please and without censor.\"\n\n   Censor/censure! Ouch - that one hurts! It might draw only a wince if\n   seen in a freshman essay, but from the \"Florida of the Booker Prize\"\n   it draws blood - the reader, still reeling from the jabs just thrown,\n   staggers.\n\n   Staggers, but carries gamely on - to the next paragraph:\n\n     \"Prostitutes enjoyed some form of legislative protection and paid\n     taxes in civilisations ranging from  Chandragupta's Indian empire\n     of 4BC ...\"\n\n   Or maybe it was the 4th century BC. But what difference does it make?\n   The fight is lost - after four such shots in four paragraphs, the\n   reader is well and truly on the ropes, with no choice but to assume a\n   defensive posture - dreading the next error (logical, linguistic or\n   factual), and doubting every single assertion that Ms. Pelling makes.\n\n\n\nComments\n\n   My favorite quote from Ms. Biddle Barrows:\n   \"Never say anything on the phone that you wouldn't want your mother to\n   hear at your trial.\"\n\n   BTW, Ms. Pelling should check out this info on the folks of\n   Polynesia...she might find it - um - interesting...\n\n   What is it about Mangaia?\n\n   \n\n   The Mayflower Madam has relatives here in Princeton. The Convent\n   Station Madam lived in Morris Township and used to be a real estate\n   agent before the property values went down.\n\n   Never heard of the Mayfair Madam but maybe E. F. Benson might have\n   included her in The freaks of Mayfair\n\n   \n\n   Ms. Pelling's \"The Decadent Handbook\" informs the decadence challenged\n   among us \"how to run a brothel, arouse your pets and rollerblade\n   decadently\". You may not see the connection immediately, but when you\n   start charging by dog hours you'll be roller blading decadently all\n   the way to the bank.\n\n   \n\n   Fausta, completely OT, is the Alchemist and Barrister still on\n   Witherspoon Street?\n\n   \n\n   Hmm. I wonder if she has included any of my postings in her research?\n\n   \n   Arlye, yes, the A&B's still on Witherspoon, and continues to do great\n   business.\n   Another good spot in town is Triumph Brewery, but I don't know if\n   you've been there. They're serving pumpkin ale for Thanksgiving.\n\n  \n   Your killing me Scott!\n\n   Funny stuff man."

        "articleBody": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES\n   IT in the Hands of Field Sales Reps\n\n   A sales force equipped with mobile tools for interconnection to\n   corporate resources can preserve a manufacturer's competitive\n   advantage.\n\n   David Kerr\n\n   The increasing complexity of today's healthcare equipment procurement\n   environment has presented some new challenges for medical device\n   manufacturing companies and their sales representatives. To gain a\n   competitive edge in influencing product selection may require\n   struggle. The emergence of intricate purchasing plans, contract-buying\n   trends, and shifting pricing options constitute one set of challenges.\n   Another relates to the growing complexity of medical technology\n   itself, particularly its incorporation of information technology (IT)\n   capabilities.\n\n   Medical device manufacturers and their field reps are discovering\n   several healthcare industry procurement hurdles that need to be\n   overcome. Group purchasing organizations (GPOs), contractual buying\n   arrangements, on-line ordering, and face-to-face selling are each\n   scenarios that present a distinct challenge for pricing and\n   relationship building. A tool that can be of value in each of these\n   situations is mobile sales force automation (SFA) technology.\n\n   Face-to-face selling is made easier by the development of personal\n   relationships with physicians and surgeons in situations where they\n   play an important role in purchasing. When doctors demand considerable\n   technical data, product training, and manufacturer support, those\n   sales reps armed with real-time data and interactive presentation\n   tools will be the ones most likely to close a sale.\n\n   In an effort to foster better relationships with, and\n   provide more value to, physicians--and to the healthcare industry\n   generally--some medtech companies are investing in integrated sales,\n   marketing, and supply-chain management systems that are known as\n   customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Mobile SFA is a\n   primary tool driving this initiative to meet, on demand and in the\n   field, ever-growing customer needs (see sidebar).\n\n   According to a recent report by market analysts Frost & Sullivan (San\n   Antonio, TX), CRM license revenue from mobile SFA applications, for\n   both wired and wireless devices, is expected to grow from a predicted\n   $169 million in 2004 to $293 million by 2008. The fastest-growing\n   segment, wireless SFA, is projected to grow from $20 million to $115\n   million over that period.^1\n\n   This article examines ways that mobile SFA can make medtech companies'\n   field-based sales forces more effective in a procurement environment\n   trending toward consolidated purchasing and automatic ordering while\n   also serving the interests of institutional purchasers.\n\n   Sales Approaches by Product Category\n\n   Three major categories of medical devices--disposable goods,\n   high-margin devices, and capital goods--call for different sales\n   approaches. Handheld sales technology plays a different role in each.\n\n   In the hospital environment, purchasing departments and GPOs tend to\n   control vendor selection, product pricing, and the awarding of\n   contracts. This holds true especially with commodity-based products\n   such as disposables (surgical gloves, swabs, and so on) where price is\n   the primary differentiator and organizations are reordering more often\n   than making first-time purchases. Rather than buying directly from a\n   sales rep, these purchasing groups use electronic purchasing\n   technology such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to maximize\n   ordering efficiency and optimize savings.\n\n   Since the decisionmaking process and the sales cycle for disposable\n   products are both very short, new purchasing and inventory\n   replenishment tend to be conducted on-line. Here, manufacturers need\n   to distinguish their products from competitors' while offering the\n   lowest price and an efficient ordering process. Despite stringent\n   pricing constraints prevalent in this category, sales reps with\n   real-time mobile access to pricing models, product specifications,\n   inventory information, and delivery schedules during the sales call\n   gain advantage for their employers in terms of better CRM\n   functionality, more-efficient document management, and electronic\n   order submission and tracking. Mobile technology gives reps the\n   ability to capture, store, and view account history during the sales\n   call, and to present new products immediately at launch.\n\n   At the other end of the medical device spectrum are capital\n   goods--heavy, expensive, highly sophisticated medical equipment. In\n   this complex segment, product lines are narrow, sales cycles are very\n   long, and purchasing decisions are made by committee.\n\n\n   Reps typically do not stock such inventory in the field, nor can they\n   demonstrate equipment for each prospect. What is imperative for them\n   is keeping a variety of technical specifications and a detailed\n   account history on hand. They can, of course, benefit from mobile SFA\n   functions that aid in selling, such as interactive presentations,\n   video product demonstrations, side-by-side product comparisons, and\n   display of technical documentation and complex pricing configurations.\n   But the handheld technology enables them also to review and update the\n   account history, check the field service and equipment maintenance\n   history, and manage customer contact information relating to every\n   member of the committee.\n\n   Selling Complex, High-Margin Devices\n\n   In between commodity disposables and capital goods falls the realm of\n   high-margin implantable and diagnostic medical devices. These\n   electromedical products have become increasingly sophisticated as they\n   have incorporated miniaturized electronics and then embedded\n   microprocessors. New IT-based devices in this category now contribute\n   heavily to the ability of physicians to make reliable therapeutic\n   decisions by means of the vital data they gather and record.\n\n   Owing to the complexity of these products, the surgeon or physician\n   who uses them typically makes or strongly influences the purchasing\n   decision. New product sales (rather than repeat sales) are common in\n   this category because physicians focus on meeting the requirements of\n   individual patients. GPOs are more price driven, but physicians\n   purchasing highly complex devices base their decisions on specific\n   patient needs, insurance reimbursements, product performance, and\n   manufacturer support.\n\n   In this situation, a close, trusting relationship between sales rep\n   and physician is critical. Physicians need to be confident of the\n   rep's recommendations, the product's reliability, and the\n   manufacturer's training support. Mobile SFA tools in the hands of\n   sales reps enable device manufacturers to satisfy these buying\n   criteria. They can help physicians make an educated decision by\n   providing:\n     * Details of product features, specifications, and benefits.\n     * Critical data regarding product reliability and accuracy, such as\n       clinical trial results.\n     * Side-by-side comparisons of competitive products.\n     * Interactive presentations and video surgical demonstrations.\n     * Downloadable educational material from the manufacturer.\n     * Reimbursement guidelines.\n\n   The mobile technology provides efficiency benefits for the wider\n   institutional healthcare system as well (see sidebar).\n\n   Mobile SFA technology facilitates relationship building by providing\n   sales reps with all the information and resources they need at the\n   point of purchase, which might be the physician's office, operating\n   room, or surgeon's lounge. Physicians are often challenged to sift\n   through and process a great deal of technical and clinical information\n   in order to make qualified decisions. Real-time access to corporate\n   systems via mobile technology enables the sales rep to anticipate and\n   respond quickly to technical questions about product performance and\n   customization options, as well as refute competitive claims, track\n   inventory, and fulfill orders on the spot. Well-prepared,\n   well-educated reps armed with a complete set of easily accessible\n   resources during the sales call are likely to be considered more\n   credible by physicians and surgeons than those who are not.\n\n   In addition, SFA technology gives sales reps the tools for introducing\n   new products to customers sooner than traditional methods would allow.\n   They can make a professional and information-rich presentation to\n   educate physicians about each new device immediately upon rollout.\n\n   Collateral Benefits\n\n   Mobile technology empowers sales reps and makes them more efficient\n   (see sidebar). But by implementing handheld SFA solutions the medical\n   device manufacturing companies that employ them gain in other ways.\n   These benefits include CRM economy, easy field deployment, greater\n   sales force productivity, and enhanced supply-chain visibility.\n\n   Alternative to Traditional CRM. Integrated CRM systems are no longer\n   restricted by high cost to enterprises with large sales teams.\n   Advances in system security and data integrity protocols allow\n   companies of all sizes to outsource the SFA function of their CRM\n   system with confidence. Also, the evolution of the application service\n   provider (ASP) model--a hosted, pay-as-you-go arrangement--makes\n   customized sales solutions affordable for smaller organizations.\n   Depending on the functionality and support level required, the cost\n   per user of hosted SFA services is comparable to that of telephone\n   service.\n\n   Ease of Deployment. Smaller medical device companies with fewer than\n   50 sales reps can field-deploy such new technologies as mobile SFA\n   quite rapidly. For reasons of economy, they tend to favor\n   subscription-based services, which can be implemented immediately and\n   independently of legacy systems. And because the IT resources they\n   employ are generally not very extensive, requirements for\n   customization and integration into back-office systems are very\n   manageable.\n\n   Larger organizations--those with, say, 500 reps or more--may require\n   more time to deploy SFA technology effectively because of the need to\n   take into account highly complex legacy systems when implementing\n   integrated field solutions. Also, decisionmaking is naturally a slower\n   process, and large internal IT departments have to take time to learn\n   the new technologies before they are prepared to support the mobile\n   sales force. An SFA pilot program involving the rollout of one\n   business unit at a time is one way for a larger enterprise to\n   accelerate deployment.\n\n   Sales Staff Productivity. Such administrative tasks as handling order\n   paperwork and entering call notes for management review can occupy a\n   substantial portion of a sales rep's workday. Medtech organizations\n   seeking ways to minimize these burdens so reps can focus on\n   revenue-generating activities such as prospecting, physician visits,\n   and relationship building may find mobile SFA technology helpful in\n   this regard. A secondary benefit is a clearer window into sales\n   activities.\n\n   Supply Chain Visibility. Most supply chain technology is focused on\n   the movement and storage of assets in the back office. By contrast,\n   mobile SFA illuminates every facet of the dynamic supply chain: in the\n   warehouse, on order, and in the field. This approach to supply-chain\n   tracking--which makes trunk inventory, consignment inventory, expired\n   products, and rep-to-rep inventory transfers completely\n   visible--enables medtech organizations to be more responsive to\n   customers' needs and to be more accountable for their own assets in\n   this era of Sarbanes-Oxley. With their sales reps using handheld\n   tracking technology to report on the movement of their personal\n   inventory in the field, corporations can maintain accurate\n   supply-chain data in real time.\n\n   Conclusion\n\n   Mobile SFA technology promotes streamlined management of the technical\n   and administrative aspects of medical technology sales and provides an\n   attractive vehicle for delivering presentations. Medical device sales\n   reps can use the technology to personalize and automate the sales\n   process for enhanced effectiveness in a progressively competitive\n   market. No matter how complex the environment, the reps have the\n   flexibility to close the sale.\n\n   Relationship- and education-driven sales and those for which\n   profitability depends on efficient, automated ordering are the two\n   poles of modern healthcare equipment procurement. In each scenario,\n   SFA technology arms field reps with detailed, real-time data to\n   satisfy the buyer and organizational tools to function effectively\n   throughout the entire sales process and deliver the competitive edge\n   their employers seek.\n \n   David Kerr is vice president of Everypath Inc.

There's a constant need to keep current\n   on emerging technologies, pressure from your customers to deliver\n   products ahead-of-schedule, and a desire to build robust and scalable\n   architectures.\n\n   Despite understanding the importance of performance to the success of\n   any application, and the attempting to design and architect your\n   application to ensure that it's robust and scalable, performance\n   management is probably more of an after-thought and doesn't become a\n   critical issue until production when the customer experiences a\n   problem.\n\n   If you had a very simple application, it might not be too difficult to\n   diagnose the problem. But, you're probably using Web services, JMS,\n   Servlets, EJBs, and other distributed technologies. When you're given\n   a support request such as, \"the application is slow\", you're most\n   likely spending countless hours trying to identify and diagnose the\n   performance problem. You won't have enough information to know where\n   to even start, which will make it very difficult to recreate the\n   problem outside of production.\n\n   This leads us to the developer's dilemma. If you want to spend more\n   type playing with new technologies such as grid computing or AOP, or\n   you want to build more functionality, you have to balance that with\n   the requirements to support the application.\n\nResolving performance problems today\n\nCommon problem resolution approaches\n\n     * Print statements or log files\n     * Operating system utilities\n     * Thread dumps\n     * Simple management tools\n     * Trial and error!\n\nKey issues in problem resolution today\n\n     * Time to resolution is too long\n     * Developers required to diagnose problems\n     * Problem may not be code-related\n     * Often requires multiple diagnostic tools\n\n   Time spent troubleshooting and fixing application issues...is time not\n   spent on new functionality\n\n   Consider the \"traditional\" approach commonly used to deal with\n   performance issues. We are all familiar with the tried-and-true\n   \"printf\" approach for measuring method call times. This technique can\n   be quite useful, except when you have to correlate individual method\n   times with an end-user experience. Spreadsheets and calculators can be\n   your friend here, but it can be very time consuming.\n\n   You might also be able to leverage a variety of operating system tools\n   to help diagnose the problem. If the production machine is hitting\n   100% CPU utilization, you might leverage a tool such as glance to\n   analyze the problem. Or, if you're experiencing thread contention or\n   Java memory issues, you might leverage specific JVM tools to identify\n   the bottleneck. Often, these techniques are too bottoms-up, making it\n   difficult, if not impossible, to understand how any single component\n   might impact the end user's experience.\n\n   If you're lucky, you may have had the opportunity to work with some\n   simple management tools. Maybe you're leveraging the WebLogic\n   administration console to get some application server statistics. Or,\n   you might have even toyed with ARM, JMX, or Log4J. Even in these\n   situations, the tools at your disposal often only provide part of the\n   answer, and you are left to piece the puzzle together to resolve the\n   problem.\n\n   Bottom line, many of the current approaches used to diagnose\n   performance problems are often very time-intensive, requiring hours or\n   days to diagnose. Many times, the problem isn't even related to the\n   application. It could be a network issue or a database issue, but\n   you've just wasted three days supporting the application instead of\n   enhancing it.\n\nHow can HP OpenView Transaction Analyzer (OVTA) help?\n\n   OVTA - Transaction level monitoring & analysis\n   Are my transactions flowing smoothly across tiers?\n   Where are the performance bottlenecks in my transactions?\n   OVTA-JD - Application/JVM/System Level Monitoring & Analysis\n   Is my application experiencing memory leaks?\n   Where are the source code level performance bottlenecks?\n\n   OVTA from HP helps you isolate application performance problems in\n   your J2EE applications. Rather than spending the time adding those\n   printf statements, stepping through your code, and trying to identify\n   exactly where your performance bottleneck is occurring, you can now\n   use a tool that can provide you with all kinds of information about\n   your application's performance.\n\n   OVTA captures end-to-end transaction information and tells you if your\n   transactions are flowing smoothly across the different application\n   tiers, including the client, the web server, the app server and the\n   database tiers. It will show you right down to the J2EE component, the\n   location of the performance bottlenecks in a given transaction.\n\n   Now, we can all make mistakes in our code, especially if we're on a\n   time crunch or are simply on a roll and hammering out code deep into\n   the night. Once we have our code developed, how do we determine\n   whether it contains a memory leak or a thread contention problem?\n   Better still, how do we track the leak back to the source code and fix\n   the issue? With the OVTA Java Diagnostics (JD) tool, we can quickly\n   determine if our application is experiencing any memory leaks, and\n   where any source code level performance bottlenecks are located.\n\n   Now you can do all of this in matter of minutes. Instead of spending a\n   half-day stepping through various aspects of your code, trying to\n   piece together the performance puzzle and making guesses on where the\n   performance bottleneck might be, you can use OVTA to quickly diagnose\n   the performance problems in your application.\n\nDemonstration: isolating performance problems with HP OVTA\n\nBackground\n\n   An application performance problem has been detected in HP OpenView\n   Internet Services\n\nDemonstration\n\n   Isolating the performance problem using HP OpenView Transaction\n   Analyzer\n\n   Let's take a look at how we can isolate an application performance\n   problem in our application using OVTA.\n\n   In this particular scenario, an IT operator or the application owner\n   is monitoring the application for availability and response time. They\n   might be using a product such as HP OpenView Internet Service (OVIS)\n   to monitor the application from end-to-end to determine overall\n   availability and performance. Here, we see a screenshot of this\n   product indicating that the response time of our application is not in\n   an acceptable state. As the operator or support specialist does some\n   quick root cause analysis, he finds that it is your application that\n   isn't performing up to defined service levels. He contacts you\n   immediately and asks you to look at a problem that is occurring with\n   your application. He doesn't tell you much except that your\n   application transaction response time rate is twice the accepted rate.\n   So how are you going to solve this problem? Let's now take a look at\n   this problem through the perspective of OVTA.\n\nA re-cap of OVTA\n\nKey OVTA differentiators\n\n     * No source code changes required\n     * Data correlated end-to-end across application tiers\n     * Very low performance impact on production systems\n     * Integrated SLA monitoring, reporting, and alarming\n     * Closes the loop between operations and development\n\nExtended application and platform support\n\n     * HP-UX, Solaris, Windows, Linux, and Itanium\n     * .NET, J2EE, and web services support\n     * Supports WebLogic Portal, JMS and Struts\n     * JMX metrics to monitor WebLogic Server health\n\n   In the demonstration, transaction data was correlated across all of\n   the application tiers. This is particularly important when you are\n   trying to assess the exact component causing the bottleneck, including\n   network or database issues that are beyond your control. This can cut\n   the diagnostic time down to just minutes so that you can quickly\n   address the problem.\n\n   HP also offers OVTA Java Diagnostics, a profiling tool that allows you\n   to perform application level analysis on running J2EE applications.\n   The tool enables operations staff and developers to work together\n   effectively in diagnosing performance bottlenecks, helping to diagnose\n   memory leaks, source code performance problems, and other JVM issues.\n\n   Additionally, the impact of having OVTA monitoring and tracking the\n   performance of your application is very low. At a high level, the\n   product provides sufficient data to monitor the application with\n   negligible overhead. You can also tune the amount of trace information\n   captured when performing diagnostics. And even then, the overhead can\n   be controlled to stay at very acceptable ranges while the problem is\n   assessed.\n\n   OVTA offers broad platform and application support, supporting HP-UX,\n   Solaris, Windows, and Linux, and is capable of supporting both J2EE\n   and .NET platforms. The product is optimized to support the WebLogic\n   platform. Additionally, the product leverages JMX technology to\n   monitor and assess the overall health of the WebLogic server. Metrics\n   such as JVM memory utilization can be used to correlate the health of\n   the server with the performance of your application.\n\nMoving beyond performance management\n\nWhy is designing for manageability important?\n\n     * Ensures high degree of application availability\n     * Minimizes support demands on the developer\n     * Enables tighter linkage between business and IT\n\nWhat can you rely on for manageability?\n\n     * Most J2EE platforms, including WebLogic, support JMX\n     * HP OpenView can monitor JMX-enabled applications\n\nWhat role can you play in manageability?\n\n     * Determine requirements for application manageability\n     * Select the right management technology (Log4J, JMX)\n     * Instrument the application, if required\n\n   We have just looked at a way to diagnose J2EE application performance\n   problems using OVTA. One way to deal with these issues is to have the\n   right sets of tools on hand to diagnose problems when they occur.\n\n   But, what if you could design your application in such a way that it\n   contains sufficient information to be better managed in operations?\n   Today, operations relies on the developer because the information\n   available to them is not sufficient to handle the problem themselves.\n   If you can make your applications more \"management aware\", you can\n   hopefully minimize the demands IT support places on you.\n\n   Additionally, designing applications with \"management in mind\" has\n   some clear benefits to your organization. With the right set of\n   management interfaces exposed by an application, and operator can\n   ensure a higher degree of application availability. Manageable\n   application can also be made more flexible and adaptive in production.\n\n   What can you do to make applications more manageable? The good news is\n   that many application platforms today provide some amount management\n   out-of-the-box. Almost all J2EE platforms, including WebLogic, expose\n   management interfaces for the platform in the form of JMX MBeans.\n   These interfaces can then leveraged by management systems such as HP\n   OpenView.\n\n   In some cases, platform-level management is not sufficient to\n   effectively manage an application in production. Some amount of work\n   might be required by the developer up-front to expose\n   application-level management interfaces.\n\nApplication management solutions with HP OpenView and BEA\n\n   HP OpenView is a BEA preferred priority choice management partner\n   HP OpenView Internet Services\n     * Provides a view of the customer experience\n     * Monitors end-to-end performance and availability\n     * Supports applications deployed on the BEA platform\n     * Monitors discrete protocols within J2EE or .NET\n\n   HP OpenView Transaction Analyzer\n     * Drill-down into applications\n     * Root-cause analysis\n     * Eliminate performance bottlenecks\n     * Component-level diagnostics\n     * Supports BEA WLS and Portal\n\n   HP OpenView Operations + Smart Plugs-ins\n     * Proactively monitor and manage IT environment\n     * Determine service impacts through service views\n     * Supports applications running on WLS or WLI\n     * Extensible through custom JMX MBeans\n\n   Your application may be developed in isolation, but it probably won't\n   run in isolation.

And the beauty of it is that they can use that\n     loudmouthed cretin John Bolton to do it:\n\n     John R. Bolton flew to Europe in 2002 to confront the head of a\n     global arms-control agency and demand he resign, then orchestrated\n     the firing of the unwilling diplomat in a move a U.N. tribunal has\n     since judged unlawful, according to officials involved.\n     \n\t A former Bolton deputy says the U.S. undersecretary of state felt\n     Jose Bustani \"had to go,\" particularly because the Brazilian was\n     trying to send chemical weapons inspectors to Baghdad. That might\n     have helped defuse the crisis over alleged Iraqi weapons and\n     undermined a U.S. rationale for war.\n     [...]\n     \n\t The Iraq connection to the OPCW affair comes as fresh evidence\n     surfaces that the Bush administration was intent from early on to\n     pursue military and not diplomatic action against Saddam Hussein's\n     regime.\n     \n\t An official British document, disclosed last month, said Prime\n     Minister Tony Blair agreed in April 2002 to join in an eventual\n     U.S. attack on Iraq. Two weeks later, Bustani was ousted, with\n     British help.\n     [...]\n     \n\t After U.N. arms inspectors had withdrawn from Iraq in 1998 in a\n     dispute with the Baghdad government, Bustani stepped up his\n     initiative, seeking to bring Iraq - and other Arab states - into\n     the chemical weapons treaty.\n     \n\t Bustani's inspectors would have found nothing, because Iraq's\n     chemical weapons were destroyed in the early 1990s. That would have\n     undercut the U.S. rationale for war because the Bush administration\n     by early 2002 was claiming, without hard evidence, that Baghdad\n     still had such an arms program.\n     \n\t In a March 2002 \"white paper,\" Bolton's office said Bustani was\n     seeking an \"inappropriate role\" in Iraq, and the matter should be\n     left to the U.N. Security Council - where Washington has a veto.\n     Bolton said in a 2003 AP interview that Iraq was \"completely\n     irrelevant\" to Bustani's responsibilities. Earle and Bohlen\n     disagree. Enlisting new treaty members was part of the OPCW chief's\n     job, they said, although they thought he should have consulted with\n     Washington.\n     \n\t Former Bustani aide Bob Rigg, a New Zealander, sees a clear U.S.\n     motivation: \"Why did they not want OPCW involved in Iraq? They felt\n     they couldn't rely on OPCW to come up with the findings the U.S.\n     wanted.\"\n     \n\t Bustani and his aides believe friction with Washington over OPCW\n     inspections of U.S. chemical-industry sites also contributed to the\n     showdown, which went on for months.\n\n     The article discusses at some length what an asshole Bolton was,\n     menacing and inapprorpiate, but then what else is new. What is\n     interesting is that the article connects the dots between Downing\n     St and this explicitly.\n     \n\t This is an AP article. Unfortunately, it is also on the wires on\n     Saturday where it is most likely to be overlooked. Unless we refuse\n     to let it.\n     \n\t The media needs a hook to start talking about Downing St. I think\n     Bolton's toast, but if the nomination goes forward I would\n     certainly hope that the Democrats would use this as an opening to\n     start talking about it. If Bolton ends up withdrawing because of\n     this (and he might) then the media also has an excuse to talk about\n     it.\n     \n\t I wonder if Monsignor Russert will see fit to discuss this between\n     Hail Mary's on Press the Meat tomorrow morning?\n\n     What's Good For The Goose Is Only Good For The Goose\n     It is interesting that the ACLU got a ruling requiring that all the\n     Abu Ghraib pictures be released to the public. What is really\n     interesting is that the government argued that releasing them would\n     be contrary to the Geneva Conventions. (Via Talk Left)\n\n     \"It is indeed ironic that the government invoked the Geneva\n     Conventions as a basis for withholding these photographs,\" said\n     Amrit Singh, a staff attorney at the ACLU. \"Had the government\n     genuinely adhered to its obligations under these Conventions, it\n     could have prevented the widespread abuse of detainees held in its\n     custody in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.\"\n\n     It's nearly impossible to be as obtuse as is the Bush\n     administration without having either some sort of cognitive problem\n     or psychological impairment. I suspect it's the latter.\n     This recent phony outrage about Amnesty International is another\n     example of this pathology. They had no problem using Amnesty to\n     buttress their case against Saddam, but balk at being called to\n     task for our own very obvious and well known human rights abuses in\n     Guantanamo. Of course, there is little mention of this (except by\n     Jon Stewart) so it doesn't matter. Patriotic correctness requires\n     that any criticism of the United States be immediately struck down\n     as treasonous, if not blasphemous.\n     \n\t If anybody still wants to know why they hate us, this would be a\n     good place to start.\n     \n\n     Who Cares What We Think?\n     Matt Yglesias, blogging from his fancy new digs at the TPM Cafe,\n     says today:\n\n     At today's Take Back America conference I saw some interesting\n     polling data from Diane Feldman on a subject I'd pondered now and\n     again. Unfortunately, the written summary of the presentation\n     doesn't contain the exact numbers and I didn't write them down\n     because I assumed this question would be included in the summary.\n     The point, however, was that when you ask if America is \"the\n     greatest country in the world\" most voters say that it is. When you\n     ask if Democrats believe that America is the greatest country, most\n     voters say that they do not.\n     \n\t I think it's clear that this perception creates some electoral\n     problems. Indeed, it's a particularly serious kind of electoral\n     problem because my guess is that the perception is probably\n     correct.\n\n     It seems to me that if you are a member of the \"reality based\"\n     community, as so many of us liberals claim to be, that you can't\n     answer such a question without qualifiers. This means that we are\n     unable to respond in appropriate knee jerk fashion and are\n     therefore assumed to be unpatriotic. The question is simple minded\n     and it demands a simple minded answer and that's a problem for us.\n     Perhaps we should just lie, like everyone already does about going\n     to church or whether they are faithful or all the other things\n     Americans are forced to lie about in our right wing PC times.\n     \n\t Patriotism is defined in the dictionary quite simply as \"love of\n     one's country and a willingness to sacrifice for it.\" That is not\n     the same thing as believing that your country is the greatest\n     country in the world. I love many things in life that aren't \"the\n     greatest\" and I don't see the conflict. One doesn't have to abandon\n     all intellectual integrity to love something, imperfect and\n     not-so-great as it may be. America is certainly the most powerful\n     country in the world. One would think that people could be\n     satisfied enough with that, but apparently not.\n     \n\t What does it mean to be the \"greatest country in the world, or as\n     I've heard it put, \"the greatest country the world has ever known\"\n     anyway? Is it measured by how fair and just our system of\n     government is or standard of living or military prowess, or what?\n     Is it, as George W. Bush pushes incessantly, because its people are\n     \"good?\" Or is it that by all measures of all things it is simply\n     the best?\n     \n\t I raise this because I suspect that what people really want from\n     liberals is not patriotism, but chauvinism, one important facet of\n     which is characterized in this context by the belief that your\n     national culture and interests are superior to any other. (Our\n     vaunted \"exceptionalism\" is not made up of a whole lot more than\n     that simple definition.) And, yes, some liberals do not sign on to\n     that, for good reason. Because it's bullshit. And America, the home\n     of mutts from all over the world, the give-me-your-tired-your-poor\n     immigrant nation, should be more aware of the shallowness and\n     idiocy of this than any other country in the world. It's not as if\n     we are Germans trying to preserve the fairy tale of a thousand year\n     Reich. It's one of the good things about not being European, with\n     all that baggage --- or would be if we thought about it for half a\n     minute.\n     \n\t Simple observation of the world shows that all nations are made up\n     of human beings, which automatically taints the project. America\n     and Iraq and China and everywhere else are comprised of this very\n     flawed species. If you live long enough you see that, as much as\n     our fearless leader likes to claim otherwise, Americans are not\n     \"better\" and therefore our country is not \"better.\" Only individual\n     people can be judged better or worse and it is without regard to\n     nationality, culture or religious belief.\n     \n\t Our democratic experiment has been a worldwide inspiration and our\n     Bill of Rights is one of the most important contributions any\n     nation has made to mankind. This country has welcomed immigrants\n     (in fits and starts) from all over the world and created a wealthy,\n     successful nation because of it. I would easily sacrifice for the\n     country, it's my home. I love it the way anyone loves their home,\n     with a deep and emotional connection that transcends intellectual\n     thought. But I don't need to suspend my judgement or my faculties\n     and further say that this country is the greatest country on earth.\n     There is no such thing as the greatest country on earth.\n     \n\t Matt feels that this presents an electoral problem. I would agree\n     if people like me were expressing these views in a political\n     campaign. (Just call me Ward Churchill, I guess.) However, the\n     perception that Matt talks about isn't fueled by some quasi\n     intellectual argument about chauvinism. It's fueled by Rush\n     Limbaugh and his band of flaming gasbags who have spent the last\n     fifteen years saying that liberals hate America day after day.\n     \n\t John Kerry volunteered for Vietnam, fought bravely, and came home\n     and devoted himself to ending what he saw as an unjust war.\n     Meanwhile his rival George Bush spent the war drinking beer and\n     fucking off. Yet Kerry was made out to be a coward and Bush a hero.\n     I suspect that my candidate, Wes Clark, would have been similarly\n     reduced to sissy status despite the fact he was a four star\n     general. Proof of love and devotion to country is not particularly\n     relevant --- just as what liberals really think about America is\n     not particularly relevant.\n     \n\t Our political problems stem from some very deep and ongoing\n     cultural anxieties that we need to think about and confront. What\n     we can't do anything about is the idea that liberals tend to be\n     more --- dare I say it --- nuanced than conservatives. It is a\n     characteristic not a policy. We're stuck with that and we're just\n     going to have to find a way to make it work for us.\n    \n\n     Common Sense\n     \n\t Dear FEC,\n    \t\n\t\tI write to you today to request your kind advisory as to whether\n     this pamphlet defines me as an ACTIVIST or a JOURNALIST. Whilst I\n     am loathe to corrupt our pristine electoral system with my calls to\n     political action, neither would I wish to cause our sanctioned\n     press any undue hardship due to its perceived affiliation with\n     rabble like myself. I do understand that \"citizen journalists\" not\n     being PROPERLY CREDENTIALED creates terrible confusion amongst the\n     leaders of government and society. I humbly request, therefore,\n     that you peruse my pamphlet with an eye toward giving me the\n     designation I shall need going forward if I wish to publish and\n     disseminate my words without government interference. I anxiously\n     await your verdict.\n     \n\t Sincerely,\n     Thomas Paine\n   \n     For The Record\n     \n\t Yesterday I mentioned the fact that that FoxNews had the incredible\n     chutzpah to discuss openly why nobody is reporting the Downing\n     Street Memo --- without actually reporting on the Downing St memo.\n     It turns out that there is a movement afoot to gain some attention\n     for this thing and I think it's worth doing, if only for history's\n     sake if nothing else. There should be a record of some Americans'\n     interest in such a damning document that proves the president of\n     the United States knowingly took the country to war on false\n     pretenses. It may come in handy someday.\n     \n\t Shakespeare's Sister informs me that theBig Brass Alliance is a\n     collection of bloggers who are supporting a group called After\n     Downing Street that is dedicated to gaining exposure for this\n     issue. One positive thing that anyone can do is sign (along with 88\n     members of congress) this letter that John Conyers has written to\n     the president requesting some answers to the obvious questions this\n     document raises.\n     \n\t This isn't some pie-in-the-sky lefty kumbaya petition (not that\n     there's anything wrong with that.) This memo is smoking gun proof\n     that Bush lied us into war. Many of us knew this from the get. But,\n     I think it's probably true that most others already know this on\n     some level as well --- a fair number are glad he did, a few more\n     don't care, and the rest just don't want to confront their own\n     bloodlust or willfull blindness. It's hard to admit you were wrong\n     about something so deadly.\n     \n\t The rest of us need to keep a clear head and insist that this not\n     be swept under the rug to the extent that we can. We have to keep\n     the idea that there will be some sort of rational accountability\n     for such acts alive in this culture or we are goners.\n     \n     Losing Their Religion\n     Regarding right wing Christians putting their embryos up for\n     adoption and insisting they not be adopted by gays or\n     non-Christians (preferably not a working woman either) AMERICAblog\n     wonders how this Bush promoted religious discrimination can get\n     past the editors of the NY Times unaddressed.\n     \n\t I'll tell you how:\n\n     Though we have our lapses, (pdf) individual news stories on\n     emotional topics like abortion, gun control, the death penalty and\n     gay marriage are reported and edited with great care, to avoid any\n     impression of bias. Nonetheless, when numerous articles use the\n     same assumption as a point of departure, that monotone can leave\n     the false impression that the paper has chosen sides. This is\n     especially so when we add in our feature sections, whose mission it\n     is to write about novelty in life. As a result, despite the strict\n     divide between editorial pages and news pages, The Times can come\n     across as an advocate.\n     \n\t The public editor found that the overall tone of our coverage of\n     gay marriage, as one example, approaches cheerleading. By\n     consistently framing the issue as a civil rights matter -- gays\n     fighting for the right to be treated like everyone else -- we\n     failed to convey how disturbing the issue is in many corners of\n     American social, cultural and religious life.\n     [...]\n     \n\t Too often we label whole groups from a perspective that\n     uncritically accepts a stereotype or unfairly marginalizes them. As\n     one reporter put it, words like moderate or centrist inevitably\n     incorporate a judgment about which views are sensible and which are\n     extreme. We often apply religious fundamentalists, another loaded\n     term, to political activists who would describe themselves as\n     Christian conservatives. ...\n\n     The editors didn't fail. They succeeded. They \"re-framed\" the issue\n     of religious discrimination and gay rights. They are simply being\n     \"sensitive\" and \"conveying how disturbing the issue us in many\n     corners of American social, cultural and religious life\" when they\n     uncritically report on a White House endorsed publicly funded group\n     that enables Christian bigots to discriminate even though it's\n     clearly against the law.\n     \n\t I think it's time we called out the PC police on the wingnuts.\n     Nobody likes political correctness, not even liberals, really. And\n     our day is long past. This is the new province of the right and\n     they have finally hammered the press into thinking that\n     discrimination and bigotry are really just normal expressions of\n     religious belief and must be treated with kid gloves. I call\n     bullshit every time one of these timorous cowards clutch their tiny\n     lace hankies and blubber something about how they are being\n     sensitive to the beliefs of bigoted assholes.\n     \n\t Just in case James Dobson and his new friends, the intellectuals at\n     the NY Times, have forgotten their eighth grade American history\n     class, Confederates used the Bible to justify slavery, too. Bin\n     Laden uses the Koran to justify terrorism. Just because they wrap\n     themselves in the Holy Books doesn't mean these theo-fascists they\n     aren't breaking the laws of both God and Man.\n     \n\t For a more in depth analysis of the NY Times \"credibility\" report,\n     see Reading A1\n   \n\n     Buy This Book\n     The Stock Ticker and the Superjumbo : How the Democrats Can Once\n     Again Become America's Dominant Political Party\n     \n\t I have ordered it and await it eagerly. Rick Perlstein is one of\n     the clearest observers of American politics around and one of the\n     very few historians who really understands how the right wing\n     works.\n     \n\t It's only 8 bucks and I guarantee that it will be worth reading\n     even if you don't agree with his conclusions:\n\n     A majority of Americans tell pollsters they want more government\n     intervention to reduce the gap between high- and lower-income\n     citizens, and less than one-third consider high taxes to be a\n     problem. Yet conservative Republicanism currently controls the\n     political discourse. Why?\n     \n\t Rick Perlstein probes this central paradox of today's political\n     scene in his penetrating pamphlet. Perlstein explains how the\n     Democrats' obsessive short-term focus on winning \"swing voters,\"\n     instead of cultivating loyal party-liners, has relegated Democrats\n     to political stagnation. Perlstein offers a vigorous critique and\n     far-reaching vision that is a thirty-year plan for Democratic\n     victory.\n\n     If you are very good, I may even be able to persuade the author to\n     do a little blogospheric interview if he's so inclined. It's long\n     past time that liberals supported their writers and thinkers the\n     way the wingnuts support theirs.\n     \n\t Update:\n     \n\t Speaking of books, are any of you libertarians out there a little\n     bit discomfited by the fact that \"On Liberty\" by JS Mill got an\n     honorable mention in the 10 worst books list by HumanEvents\n     magazine? I mean, \"Mein Kampf\" and \"Das Kapital\" aren't big\n     surprises. I'm not shocked by \"The Feminine Mystique\" or even the\n     inclusion of John Maynard Keynes (although you have to love this\n     commentary: \"FDR adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S.\n     government now has a $2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion\n     dollar debt.\" Haha.)\n     \n\t But \"On Liberty\"? What, he wasn't sufficiently agitated about stem\n     cell research? The capital gains tax?\n     \n\t Jesus, I now have not one single intellectual connection to the\n     right. Not one. They are aliens from another planet.\n  \n     The Party Of Krugman\n     \n\t Somebody asked me what my favorite columnist was the other day and\n     I said that I thought most liberal bloggers like Krugman because he\n     writes the way we write --- he doesn't suffer fools and he writes\n     with all the righteous indignation he feels at what he sees. And, I\n     suspect that this is why establishment journos like Daniel Okrent\n     don't like him. He just refuses to play the game by establishment\n     rules.\n     \n\t This post by Brad DeLong exposes the entire silly social aspect of\n     this and gives us a window into why liberals are being marginalized\n     in the mainstream media. We are supposed to be nice. The other side\n     is expected to be tough and uncompromising. Krugman is a fighter\n     and he never gives ground when he thinks he's right. That's\n     unbecoming in a liberal because it means that you have to engage in\n     the facts and have a real argument instead of just hurling insults\n     or bumper stickers as you can when dealing with right wing critics.\n     \n\t Daniel Okrent finds his behavior unseemly and annoying:\n\n     For a man who makes his living offering strong opinions, Paul\n     Krugman seems peculiarly reluctant to grant the same privilege to\n     others. And for a man who leads with his chin twice a week, he acts\n     awfully surprised when someone takes a pop at it\n     [...]\n     \n\t On Prof. Krugman's defense of his unfamiliarity with it, he's\n     effectively saying, \"If I didn't know about it, it must not be\n     important.\" This is a polemicist's dodge; no self-respecting\n     journalist would ever make such an argument.\n     [...]\n     \n\t Believe me -- I could go on, as could a number of readers more\n     sophisticated about economic matters than I am. (Among these are\n     several who, like me, generally align themselves politically with\n     Prof. Krugman, but feel he does himself and his cause no good when\n     he heeds the roaring approval of his acolytes and dismisses his\n     critics as ideologically motivated.) But I don't want to engage in\n     an extended debate any more than Prof. Krugman says he does. If he\n     replies to this statement, as I imagine he will, I'll let him have\n     what he always insists on keeping for himself: the last word.\n     I hate to do this to a decent man like my successor, Barney Calame,\n     but I'm hereby turning the Krugman beat over to him.\n\n     Oh Boo hoo hoo. God forbid a liberal should accuse one's critics of\n     being ideologically motivated. You would think that the ombudsman\n     of the NY Times would have a slightly bigger bone to pick with the\n     right wing which has been calling them ideologically motivated for\n     40 fucking years. But then, that would require they acknowledge\n     reality and that is what cannot happen.\n     \n\t Paul Krugman is an in-your-face, unapologetic member of the reality\n     based community. He calls it as he sees it and he doesn't mince\n     words in doing so. As he amply demonstrated in his response to\n     Okrent's shallow criticisms (which, even if true, would hardly\n     back-up his calumnous accusations in his last piece) Krugman does\n     not particularly enjoy being told he is wrong on the facts when he\n     isn't. World class economists may be used to being called to task\n     for their conclusions or their predictions, but saying that he is\n     cooking the numbers for partisan reasons are fighting words. His\n     reputation rests on his intellectual integrity. Of course he is\n     going to fight when challenged by lame conventional wisdom and\n     spoonfed propaganda. If only more liberal pundits had his guts we\n     might not be where we are today.\n     \n\t Paul Krugman is tough and fearless and we need more like him --\n     people who are not part of the cliquish Sally Quinn social scene\n     (it about made me puke to read that unctuous little screed again)\n     and who do not depend upon the approbation of aging social mavens\n     for their self esteem.\n     \n\t Tell me that the party of Krugman is a bunch of soft cowards who\n     can't fight terrorism or run a disciplined economic agenda. Tell me\n     the party of Krugman doesn't know what it believes in. The party of\n     Krugman believes in reality, that the emperor has no clothes, that\n     up is up and down is down. And it isn't afraid to tell snivelling\n     little babies like Daniel Okrent to stick it where the sun don't\n     shine. The party of Krugman doesn't lay down and take it. It\n     fights.\n     \n\t Update! Somerby takes Okrent, skewers him quickly and then slowly\n     roasts him over a very high flame. It is awesome. Okrent, the\n     Manhattan fop.\n    \n     No Mirrors Available\n     \n\t This is too much. Shakespeare's Sister spots a FoxNews headline\n     that says: Downing Street Memo Mostly Ignored in US.\n     \n\t Can you believe it? And then Fox goes on to wonder why that might\n     be. They simply can't figure it out. They interview people and\n     ponder the question and go to great lengths to explain why it isn't\n     being reported. I don't see that they interview Roger Ailes or John\n     Moody, however. Perhaps they were too busy.\n     \n\t They even point out that the left has been trying in vain to get\n     attention for the issue:\n\n     Several popular left-leaning blogs have taken up the cause to keep\n     the story alive, encouraging readers to contact media outlets. A\n     Web site, DowningStreetMemo.com, tells readers to contact the White\n     House directly with complaints.\n     \n\t \"This is a test of the left-wing blogosphere,\" said Jim Pinkerton,\n     syndicated columnist and regular contributor to FOX News Watch, who\n     pointed out that The Sunday Times article came out just before the\n     British election and apparently had little effect on voters'\n     decisions.\n     \n\t \"In many ways that memo might prove all of the arguments the\n     critics of the war have made,\" he added. \"But the bulk of Americans\n     don't agree, or don't seem that alarmed, so it is a power test to\n     see if they can drive it back on the agenda.\"\n\n     I guess the fact that most people don't know is irelevant.\n     Certainly, it can't be because FoxNews itself isn't reporting it.\n     Except, of course, to report that nobody cares.\n     \n\t Even though Pinkerton is trying to turn this into a test of the\n     liberal blogosphere for gawd knows what reason, it is an important\n     story that we should continue to press. Sometimes these things take\n     time.\n     \n\t Check out DowningStreetMemo.com. They'll tell you where to send\n     your angry lefty e-mail.\n  \n     Your Lovin' Don't Pay My Bills\n     \n\t John Aravosis wonders if liberals have \"issues\" with money --- he\n     sees a hostility toward money on the left and wonders where it\n     comes from. His readers offer some very interesting opinions on the\n     matter, so be sure to read the comment thread if you find this\n     topic intriguing.\n     \n\t I have a slightly different perception on the matter than most, it\n     seems. I admit to having issues with it, probably because I always\n     valued time over money. (Of course, as you get older you begin to\n     realize that you run out of that too.) However, I don't harbor\n     resentment toward others. I made my choices and I don't live a life\n     full of regret about much of anything. I have no moral qualms about\n     making money (in a decent way) and I don't think that it's my\n     business to judge others on what they choose to spend it on. I\n     appreciate what it can do to make life comfortable for the\n     individual and how it motivates people to work. I certainly accept\n     that there is something intrinsic to human nature in the\n     acquisition of wealth and the desire to succeed. But I do have\n     issues, nonetheless.\n     \n\t John's readers more than adequately explain what I think is the\n     common liberal argument against money and it's the general belief\n     in egalitarianism --- that it is not really moral to have too much\n     when others have so little. These are ideas that, ironically\n     enough, stem from Christian teaching. So much for the godless\n     heathens of the left.\n     \n\t I don't approach this from a moral standpoint, although I'm\n     sympathetic to the notion just from a human empathetic standpoint.\n     If you've ever spent much time in the third world, you realize\n     right quick that human life is valued very differently on our\n     planet and it won't make you feel particularly terrific about your\n     own (except, of course, for the South Park Republicans who\n     apparently can't think beyond their good luck --- what they would\n     call their natural superiority --- at being American.)\n     \n\t It has been my experience that money confers power over others and\n     that is where I personally get uncomfortable. This is not directly\n     related to marxist theory, although I would suspect that there\n     isn't a lefty (or a righty for that matter) who hasn't been\n     influenced to some degree by it, so it's certainly relevant to my\n     thinking on the issue. (He diagnosed the illness, it was his\n     prescription that wasn't so hot.) Mostly,though, I think it's a\n     matter of human psychology. People who work for wages, particularly\n     those lower on the scale, are simply not in control of their lives\n     in the same way as are those who work for themselves or those who\n     are independently wealthy. From being treated like a lackey by the\n     boss to having to answer to your mother-in-law because she loaned\n     you money for the down payment, there is a slight, and sometimes\n     not so slight, corruption of your freedom every time you are\n     dependent upon another individual's goodwill. And it is a rare\n     person who will not immediately exercise this power over others if\n     they feel threatened or angry and a rare person who will not feel\n     the metaphorical lash at having to answer for it.\n     \n\t As much as I am concerned as they are with individual freedom, this\n     is why I find it so hard to relate to libertarians; I think that\n     the common experience of working for wages and being beholden to\n     another individual is more of a tangible infringement upon personal\n     liberty than the extraction of taxes for the greater good. The\n     infringement on personal freedom that is most immediate and\n     constant in most people's lives is having to brownnose another\n     human being or play fast and loose with the rules because their\n     financial survival depends upon it. It's why I support unions and\n     workplace rules and consumer rights. In the everyday lives of most\n     people, the biggest limits on their freedom and challenges to their\n     integrity come not from government regulators but greedy and\n     powerful employers.\n     \n\t And yet, it is the way of the world and we each have to find a way\n     to live with a modicum of decency and integrity within it. And I\n     think it is a much more complicated and difficult row to hoe than\n     we Americans think it is. It is not as easy to obtain financial\n     freedom as some would have it nor is financial success a perfect\n     illustration of an individual's merit. That's why I don't much like\n     money, in a general conceptual way. It has corrupted friendships,\n     family, jobs and relationships in ways that nothing else in my life\n     ever has. It can and is used as a weapon as often as a tool. In a\n     hyper capitalist society such as ours, it's perhaps the single most\n     powerful method the individual has (or doesn't have) to create his\n     or her own destiny. It's both a blessing and a curse.\n     \n\t It's a good thing to think about how you really feel about it ---\n     most Americans never question their assumptions. In many ways, it's\n     probably easier that way. Bravo to John for bringing it up.\n     \n\t And by the way, I hope this makes it clear that I do not hold with\n     the idea that because a blogger accepted donations that he or she\n     is required to answer to the donors. Indeed, I think the opposite.\n     People give money because they appreciate the work. When they don't\n     appreciate the work they don't give money. It's one of the cleanest\n     exchanges of goods and services around, fully voluntary and without\n     further obligation on either part.\n     \n\t This reminds me of a relative who wanted to help out her\n     grandfather in his later years. He was living with an aunt who also\n     had little money. This relative agreed to send a hundred dollars a\n     month. When she went to visit she found out that granddad was\n     drinking a couple of beers every night and the aunt played bingo on\n     Saturdays. The relative considered these expenses to be a waste.\n     She figured her hundred a month entitled her to straighten up these\n     people's bad habits and she insisted that because she had sent\n     them, by this time, more than a couple thousand dollars that they\n     already owed her quite a lot, even if she withdrew her monthly\n     stipend. They gave up the beer and the bingo but the relative\n     continued to find their spending habits objectionable and made sure\n     that they knew it and did as they were told. Granddad was reduced\n     to sneaking around and the aunt was isolated from all the friends\n     she used to see at weekly bingo. They felt like children. Luckily\n     they both died before long and ended the ritual humiliation the\n     whole thing had evolved into. The money was not worth it.\n     \n\t If Aravosis wanted to blow all his donations on lottery tickets\n     they'd be his to blow. If that bothers you, don't donate again. But\n     making a donation doesn't entitle anyone to think they own John or\n     his blog. He owns himself, always.\n    \n\n     Maybe He Won't Be Back\n     \n\t Check out this fascinating pictorial deconstruction of\n     Schwarzeneger's ad on BagNewsNotes today. (Or just click the ad at\n     left.) For those of you who don't live in California, this ad is\n     just pathetic, and it's chock full of product placement. I don't\n     think I've ever seen this many brand names in a political\n     commercial before.\n     \n\t But, as BNN points out, it's also aesthetically just a terrible ad\n     --- even by political ad standards which aren't very high. It's not\n     that it has some sort of cinema verite authenticity in its badness.\n     It's just ugly and ineffectual.\n     \n\t This is the mega star of the 1980's we're talking about here. The\n     man whose entire claim to fame is his celebrity. Yet his people\n     produce an ad that could have been done by someone(with lots of\n     high placed friends in the food and beverage business) running for\n     the San Bernardino school board. And it comes on the heels of\n     months of very effective ads done by the public employees unions\n     featuring the the sunny smiles of elementary schoolteachers and\n     nurses and the rugged all American features of heroic firefighters.\n     (Jon Stewart said \"those are some MILFS.\")\n     \n\t I think that people expect Schwarzenneger's ads to be professional\n     show business quality. That is, after all, the only thing he's got\n     going for him. Nobody voted for Arnold because of his great ideas\n     or policy prescriptions. He didn't have any then and he doesn't\n     have any now. They did expect him to at least play the part of the\n     Governor well on TV. But then again, he never was the actor Ronald\n     Reagan was in the movies, either. And that's saying something.\n     \n\n     The Incredible Shrinking President\n     \n\t Funny how we haven't seen any of the weekly news magazines do a\n     cover story on the fact that Bush is the earliest lame duck in\n     history. Considering that they were writing Bill Clinton's epitaph\n     within three months of his first term, one might conclude that they\n     are using a different standard. How unusual.\n     But then again, it isn't his fault and it isn't his job. Unlike\n     Clinton he doesn't have a congressional majority of his own party\n     to lead. Oh wait...\n     \n\t Bush Rejects Talk of Waning Influence:\n\n     President Bush dismissed yesterday suggestions that his influence\n     is waning less than six months into his second term, blaming\n     partisanship and timidity in Congress for the lack of action on his\n     plans to bring change to the United Nations, restructure Social\n     Security and enact a new energy policy this year.\n     \n\t \"I don't worry about anything here in Washington, D.C.,\" Bush said\n     during a news conference in the White House's Rose Garden. \"I feel\n     comfortable in my role as the president, and my role . . . is to\n     push for reform.\" With Democrats and Republicans alike questioning\n     the clout of a president whose approval ratings have sunk to new\n     lows, Bush said it is Congress that must prove it is \"capable of\n     getting anything done.\"\n\n     His job is to \"push for reform?\" I thought he was keeping the\n     babies safe and fending off drone planes with his bare hands.\n     What's going on here? The man with the codpiece can't get a\n     Republican congress to enact his agenda? Man, those panting\n     security moms must be disappointed. The difference between the 85%\n     Collossus of 2002 and the petulant powerlessness of today is stark.\n     And he clearly didn't like the way people were talking about his\n     soul brother Vladimir:\n\n     Speaking a few hours after former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail\n     Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a trial\n     that many democratic activists called politically motivated, Bush\n     said he has expressed concerns about the legal proceedings to\n     President Vladimir Putin and will watch the appeals process\n     closely. \"Here, you are innocent until proven guilty, and it\n     appeared to us, at least people in my administration, that it\n     looked like he had been judged guilty prior to having a fair\n     trial,\" Bush said.\n\n     I guess he wanted to preserve his personal deniability for when he\n     and Vlady next meet over beers and pork rinds at the ranch set. Or\n     he just didn't see the problem. After all, this is the man who said\n     several thousand times that Saddam had to be disarmed and then\n     pulled out the weapons inspectors when they didn't find the proof.\n     Seems to me that he has an affinity for the concept of judging\n     guilty before having a fair trial.\n     \n\t And, of course he and everyone in the press corpse are too thick to\n     see the utter vacuity of his statement in light of what he said\n     just a few minutes before about alleged human rights abuses\n     Guantanamo:\n\n     \"It seemed to me they based some of their decisions on the word of\n     -- and the allegations -- by people who were held in detention,\n     people who hate America, people that had been trained in some\n     instances to disassemble -- that means not tell the truth,' Bush\n     said.\"\n\n     Yes, he actually said \"disassemble\" --- and then had the nerve to\n     be snotty about it and define it. There is no end to the man's\n     arrogance and ignorance.\n     \n\t Bush apparently has no idea that when he starts lecturing Moscow or\n     Beijing about \"fair trials\" everyone now collapses in convulsive\n     laughter. Guantanamo has changed forever the idea that Americans\n     have a fair and impartial judicial system based upon the rule of\n     law and the constitution. Bush and his cronies have shown that we\n     are more than capable of suspending those things at will. If we\n     ever had any moral authority, it has been officially flushed down\n     the toilet.\n     \n\t Not that it really matters to these people. They don't believe that\n     it's important to have moral authority. They only believe that it's\n     important to have big guns and a willingness to use them.\n     Unfortunately, we don't seem to be all that good at the Empire\n     building thing. Maybe keeping our moral authority backed by the\n     threat of force rather than a clumsy and useless demonstration of\n     our ineptitude might have been a better way to go.\n     \n\t This is going to be a long 3 and a half years. But I'm beginning to\n     think I may enjoy them more than Junior will.\n    \n\n     New Ideas\n     \n\t This is good. Some in the administration are apparently questioning\n     whether waging a \"Global War on Terror\" is an effective way to deal\n     with the threat of islamic fundamentalism. Wow. Next thing you know\n     they'll be wondering whether taxes and expenditures ought to be in\n     balance or something. Weird.\n\n     \n\t The review marks the first ambitious effort since the immediate\n     aftermath of the 2001 attacks to take stock of what the\n     administration has called the \"global war on terrorism\" -- or GWOT\n     -- but is now considering changing to recognize the evolution of\n     its fight. \"What we really want now is a strategic approach to\n     defeat violent extremism,\" said a senior administration official\n     who described the review on the condition of anonymity because it\n     is not finished. \"GWOT is catchy, but there may be a better way to\n     describe it, and those are things that ought to be incumbent on us\n     to look at.\"\n\n     Yeah. \"GWOT\" is a catchy phrase that's been sweeping the nation\n     like wildfire.\n     \n\t So they've decided that what we really need is a strategic approach\n     to defeat violent extremism. Hmmm. I have an idea. How about we\n     invade and occupy a non terrorist country in the middle of the\n     region, create political chaos and foment a civil war? Surely that\n     can only be seen as a gesture of goodwill on our part. But just in\n     case we should probably say that the country has nukes strapped to\n     drone planes that are ready to attack the eastern seaboard at any\n     moment. (Nobody will remember any of that in a year anyway.)\n     \n\t Well, maybe that's not such a hot idea after all.\n\n     Much of the discussion has focused on how to deal with the rise of\n     a new generation of terrorists, schooled in Iraq over the past\n     couple years. Top government officials are increasingly turning\n     their attention to anticipate what one called \"the bleed out\" of\n     hundreds or thousands of Iraq-trained jihadists back to their home\n     countries throughout the Middle East and Western Europe. \"It's a\n     new piece of a new equation,\" a former senior Bush administration\n     official said. \"If you don't know who they are in Iraq, how are you\n     going to locate them in Istanbul or London?\"\n\n     Interesting. Who would have ever dreamed this could happen? Oh,\n     that's right. Those of us who were against the invasion. In fact,\n     it was the central practical argument that I and most others I know\n     set forth at the time. It was always obvious that invading Iraq was\n     going to foment terrorism, not quell it. Anybody with a sixth grade\n     education could see that. Well, except for some Republicans who\n     went to Andover, Yale and Harvard, that is.\n     \n\t I really can't believe it. After they just ran a ruthless,\n     mendacious, presidential campaign of character assasination against\n     anyone who diverted even a half step from their party line, here\n     they are, basically admitting that their entire GWOT is a fucking\n     goddamned mistake.\n     \n\t The good news though is that just as they were before 9/11, the\n     administration is focused like a laser beam on combatting\n     terrorism:\n\n     The review may have been slowed somewhat by the fact that many of\n     the key counterterrorism jobs in the administration have been empty\n     for months, including the top post at the State Department for\n     combating terrorism, vacant since November, and the directorship of\n     the new National Counterterrorism Center. \"We're five months into\n     the next term, and still a number of spots have yet to be filled,\"\n     Cressey said. \"You end up losing valuable time.\"\n     \n\t The counterterrorism center was created nearly a year ago by Bush\n     to serve as the main clearinghouse for terrorism-related\n     intelligence but is not yet fully operational, and has been run by\n     an acting director and caught up in the broader wave of\n     bureaucratic reorganization that resulted in the creation of the\n     new directorate of national intelligence, whose fiefdom the center\n     will join.\n     \n\t As part of the reorganization, a new office of strategic and\n     operational planning is slated to become the focal point for\n     operations aimed at terrorists, but that, too, has yet to start\n     working fully, the senior counterterrorism official said.\n     \n\t Townsend just hired a deputy last week, Treasury official Juan\n     Carlos Zarate, to take on the terrorism portfolio at the NSC;\n     Townsend had been doing that as well as serving as the president's\n     top homeland security aide for the past year. Several\n     counterterrorism sources said the State job will soon be filled by\n     CIA veteran Hank Crumpton and the counterterrorism center post is\n     slated to go to Air Force Gen. Charles F. Wald, current deputy\n     commander of U.S. forces in Europe.\n     \n\t \"They recognize there's been a vacuum of leadership,\" said a former\n     top counterterrorism official, who spoke on the condition of\n     anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \"There has\n     been a dearth of senior leadership directing this day to day. No\n     one knows who's running this on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\n     Well, that's good. We're creating terrorists by the thousands day\n     after day but the administration can't get it together enough to\n     hire the people it needs to fill the anti-terrorist positions. The\n     president himself is awfully busy, as we know, tilting at his\n     private windmill accounts and riding his trike in the woods. Cheney\n     is undoubtedly putting all his efforts into figuring out how to\n     justify the use of tactical nuclear weapons on California. Who has\n     time to deal with this terrorism thing? It's so 2002.\n     \n\t Ooops, I forgot one very important member of the administration who\n     is working night and day on this problem. Karen Hughes has the\n     vital responsibility of changing the negative perception of\n     Americans in the middle east, which is key to their new strategy of\n     combatting violent extremism. I hear her latest campaign is about\n     to be revealed: she's going to tell those terrorists and jihadists\n     that the US is a compassionate crusader --- an occupier with\n     optimism --- an inspirational imperialist with integrity! Once\n     those terrorists hear the mellifluous melody of her awesome\n     alliteration, just like the Red States they will all fall in love.\n     \n\t Update: James Wolcott tells us that Michael Ledeen is just hopping\n     mad about all this \"re-evaluation\" business. You can certainly\n     understand why. He's the guy who seriously made the case to invade\n     France and Germany just two years ago. This has to be a blow.\n\n     Twice in the past, the president slid into a similar funk, first\n     permitting himself to be gulled by the Saudis into believing he had\n     to make a deal with Arafat before he was entitled to liberate Iraq,\n     then permitting the British to drag out the run-up to Operation\n     Iraqi Freedom with endless votes in the Security Council. Each time\n     he realized his error, and pressed on with greater vigor. Its time\n     for him to do that again.\"\n\n     The 101st Keyboarders need to saddle up their Aaron chairs and cock\n     their control buttons. This is bigger even than the GWOT. It's a\n     fight for the Codpiece and that's a battle only they know how to\n     fight with the relish and expertise that's called for. They may\n     have lost their beloved leader General Sullivan, but they will\n     valiantly carry on without him. These brave souls will never give\n     in, never give in, never give in.\n     \n     Spent Capital\n     \n\t I'm Baaaack. Sorry for the interruption in service folks. I've been\n     indisposed, but now I'm right as rain and ready to rumble. Or\n     thunder. Or something...\n     And what do I see first thing? Bush's Political Capital Spent,\n     Voices in Both Parties Suggest. Sweet.\n\n     Two days after winning reelection last fall, President Bush\n     declared that he had earned plenty of \"political capital, and now I\n     intend to spend it.\" Six months later, according to Republicans and\n     Democrats alike, his bank account has been significantly drained.\n     \n\t In the past week alone, the Republican-led House defied his veto\n     threat and passed legislation promoting stem cell research; Senate\n     Democrats blocked confirmation, at least temporarily, of his choice\n     for U.N. ambassador; and a rump group of GOP senators abandoned the\n     president in his battle to win floor votes for all of his judicial\n     nominees.\n     \n\t With his approval ratings in public opinion polls at the lowest\n     level of his presidency, Bush has been stymied so far in his\n     campaign to restructure Social Security. On the international\n     front, violence has surged again in Iraq in recent weeks,\n     dispelling much of the optimism generated by the\n     purple-stained-finger elections back in January, while allies such\n     as Egypt and Uzbekistan have complicated his campaign to spread\n     democracy.\n     \n\t The series of setbacks on the domestic front could signal that the\n     president has weakened leverage over his party, a situation that\n     could embolden the opposition, according to analysts and\n     politicians from both sides. Bush faces the potential of a summer\n     of discontent when his capacity to muscle political Washington into\n     following his lead seems to have diminished and few easy victories\n     appear on the horizon.\n\n     Well, yes. But it's because he never had any political capital to\n     begin with. This was a big lie, just like the alleged mandate. He\n     had neither. There was just enough of a fading vestige of 9/11\n     around (and enough of the media's unctuous sycophancy) to keep a\n     little of that hi-pro glow on the Prez. But he never had a mandate\n     for any of his policies. These guys rode a wave, they didn't win a\n     landslide.\n     \n\t At some point hype, like helium, dissipates and you are left with\n     nothing but the flaccid balloon. Junior and Rove are not geniuses\n     or political wizards who have reshaped politics in their image.\n     They are the guys who got in on a hummer in 2000 and were in office\n     on 9/11. Period. The only truly impressive legislative victory has\n     been passing massive tax cuts for rich people, which is hardly a\n     difficult thing to ask politicians to do when you also break open\n     the pork barrel and let them gorge on all the pig they can possibly\n     stomach. That's quite an achievement.\n     \n\t The fact is that Junior has been a lame duck since January 21,\n     2005. And I believe he's happy with that. All he ever cared about\n     was getting legitimately elected and doing what his father did not\n     --- win a second term. He doesn't give a damn about legacy. As he\n     famously said, \"History, we dont know. Well all be dead.\"\n     \n\t He's just going through the motions, like a high school senior\n     who's already been accepted to college. The Republican caucus is\n     under new leadership --- the GOP PepBoys Dobson, Frist and DeLay.\n     I'm beginning to look forward to 2006."

        "articleBody": "Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season\n   It was the year of fire... the year of destruction ... It was the year\n   everything changed.\n   by Sergio Non\n   \n\n   February 11, 2004 - Talk all you want about special effects,\n   spaceships and alien costumes, but above all, the enduring mark of\n   great sci-fi is ideas. It's especially true for sci-fi TV shows, which\n   love to bludgeon viewers with Major Themes: Being Human (Spock, Data,\n   The Doctor, various clones); Cultural Diversity (aliens, we love you);\n   What Is Real? (time travel; holodecks; shape shifters); Privacy and\n   Individual Rights (telepaths); Religion (The Force); and of course,\n   The Meaning of Life (Yoda).\n   \n   But Babylon 5 wielded the biggest, bluntest instrument of all, and it\n   smashed through season four to create an outsized beast of\n   grandiosity. Everything about this set screams of self-conscious\n   ambition.\n   \n   The Show\n   Ultimately, Babylon 5 was all about the ideas of its creator and\n   executive producer J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote the screenplays\n   for the majority of the shows, including every episode of the last two\n   seasons. His ambition dominated Babylon 5 throughout its run: \"I'm\n   pretty rigorous in my scripts most of the time. I don't tend to allow\n   for a lot of improvisation or a lot of changing around.\"\n   \n   The content certainly drips with self-importance -- operatic music;\n   exaggerated, acting; didactic dialogues about Really Important Topics;\n   sweeping shots of battle -- and in its desperate attempt to be taken\n   seriously, Babylon 5 ends up stagey and affected.\n   \n   Why show consequences when his characters can tell us (and tell us and\n   tell us and tell us) about them? Who needs naturalistic dialogue when\n   there's preaching to be done? What's the use of small gestures when\n   gesticulation can chew up the camera? Why cap the big showdown between\n   Shadows and Vorlons with an exciting fight when you can end with a\n   long-winded Sheridan speech?\n   \n   Viewers might have thought the Shadow conflict - which powered the\n   show for much of Babylon 5's first three years -- would take an entire\n   season to complete, but it was resolved by the sixth show, Into the\n   Fire, making the next 16 episodes feel a bit like one long denouement.\n\n   By the time Babylon 5 finally delivers a massive space battle in\n   episode 20, Endgame, it's hard to care. It didn't help that\n   Straczynski mixed senseless space battle cliches like\n   all-weapons-and-shields-are-down-so-let's-ram-them with one clever\n   idea involving telepaths and ships.\n   \n   Yet the maddening and unintentionally comic elements of Babylon 5\n   often worked.\n   \n   Sometimes the outsized, over-the-top acting and dialogue approaches\n   brilliance. The devious, sneering Ambassador Londo Mollari might be\n   one of the greatest TV sci-fi characters of all time, and his actor,\n   Peter Jurasik, gets to bluster and show off his outlandish accent to\n   full effect in season four. Mira Furlan's breathless portrayal of\n   Ambassador Delenn and Jerry Doyle's smartass, grumpy cop take on Chief\n   Garibaldi are weirdly compelling.\n   \n   And for all his wordiness, Straczynski can write remarkable scenes.\n   Season 4's last episode, The Deconstruction of Falling Stars, offered\n   a microcosm of the show's best and worst traits. Set up as a\n   far-future historian's look back at the effect of Babylon 5 on Earth\n   history, the script insists on extolling the greatness of Sheridan and\n   his cohorts - you can't get more heavy-handed than Delenn glaring at a\n   trio of academic strawmen and wheezing that Sheridan \"was a good man.\"\n\n\n   On the other hand, Deconstruction includes a wonderful vignette that\n   -- in a nod to the classic novel Canticle for Leibowitz -- features an\n   older monk defending the Babylon 5 \"myth\" against the questions of his\n   younger colleague; it's a touching, eloquent defense of religious\n   belief, and especially surprising coming from a skeptic like\n   Straczynski.\n   \n   Lots to dislike, but even more to love. The ideas and their build-up\n   make Babylon 5 worth watching, especially in its climactic season. If\n   only the payoff were better.\n   \n   Score: 9 out of 10\n   \n   The Video\n   \n   Sadly, the video quality can make the watching a little hard on the\n   eyes. Considering this is a science-fiction show with some fairly\n   sophisticated 3D graphics, it wouldn't have been asking too much to\n   clean up the video for DVD distribution.\n   \n   Instead, the ongoing insistence on painting Babylon 5 as an Epic For\n   Our Time may have actually made picture quality worse on DVDs. The\n   live action sequences were shot in 16:9 format with high-definition\n   television screens in mind, but to save money, the special effects\n   were created for 4:3 viewing. Thus, all CGI effects are, in effect,\n   blown-up on the DVDs, which present the show 16:9, in keeping with\n   Straczynski's original vision.\n   \n   The end result? For any scene with special effects, including\n   composite shots that mix live-action and CGI, the same problems noted\n   in IGN's previous review exist here: graininess, jagged edges and\n   digital errors, even on non-HD television sets. If you don't have a\n   high-definition television, try watching this on a PC's DVD player --\n   you may find yourself wondering if you're watching a DivX downloaded\n   from the Internet or an actual DVD.\n   \n   The quality on the trailers is even worse.\n   \n   Score: 4 out of 10\n   \n\n               Excuse me, what were you saying about my hair?\n\n   Audio and Languages\n   Babylon 5 does a workmanlike job with its 5.1 sound. Muscular surround\n   sound systems can show off with the bombastic \"No Surrender, No\n   Retreat\" musical suite -- you'll definitely know if your subwoofer\n   works, and your rear speakers , while not used as extensively as in a\n   high-quality theatrical release, get more of a workout than from most\n   TV shows.\n   \n   As far as the show itself, careful listeners will pick up a few\n   incidental noises, as well as echo effects of computer voices -- check\n   out the final sequence in Deconstruction for a good sample. However,\n   as is often the case with TV shows, Babylon 5's battle sounds -- which\n   rear speakers should be carrying more than any other track -- are\n   generally front-loaded.\n   \n   The set has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. Happily, the\n   subtitles remain during the audio commentaries.\n   Score: 7 out of 10\n\n   Shame that 200 years from now, we still won't have a cure for\n   baldness.\n\n   Packaging and Extras\n   \n   The 6-disc set comes in a thin Amaray holders. It includes a pamphlet\n   with brief synopses of each episode.\n   \n   Audio commentaries include one for episode 4, Falling Toward\n   Apotheosis, with actors Jurasik, Doyle, Bruce Boxleitner (who played\n   Sheridan) and Patricia Tallman (telepath Lyta Alexander). Apparently\n   it was recorded via remote, since some of the actors indicate they're\n   in different locations. It's also entirely useless for anyone seeking\n   insight into the show - the group spends most of its time cracking\n   jokes about the shape of Doyle's head, followed by Boxleitner's\n   ability (or lack thereof) to remember lines, and the Londo hairpiece\n   that Jurasik wore.\n   Hey baby, come here often?\n\n   \n   Perhaps the actors kept it breezy, knowing that Straczynski would more\n   than make up for it with his excessively thoughtful audio supplement\n   to two episodes, The Face of the Enemy and the aforementioned\n   Deconstruction. The former also includes comments from director\n   Michael Vejar. Straczynski also sits down for a separate interview\n   that serves as an introduction to and overview of the entire show.\n   \n   Disc Six includes a short documentary about the show's composer,\n   Christopher Franke, a performance of the \"No Surrender, No Retreat\"\n   orchestral suite, a gag reel and a Universe of Babylon 5 feature with\n   tidbits about various Babylon 5 elements.\n   \n   Preview trailers are included for each episode. Warner Brothers should\n   have left them out -- what's the point of trailers for episodes that\n   can already be watched at will? - and used the extra space for higher\n   video quality.\n   Score: 7 of 10\n\n   This is what happens when some people try to hook up their own\n   satellite dish.\n\n   IGN's Ratings for Babylon 5: The Complete Fourth Season\n   Rating Description\n   \n   9 The Movie\n   We love it, we love it not.

        "articleBody": "Effect Measure \n\n   Effect Measure is a forum for progressive public health discussion and\n   argument as well as a source of public health information from around\n   the web that interests the Editor(s)\n\nH7 in North Korea\n\n   Reports from Pyongyang, North Korea today seem to indicate that the\n   unidentified bird flu strain afflicting North Korean poultry is of the\n   H7, not H5, sub-type. AP says this has been confirmed by FAO, but New\n   Scientist says evidence is \"indirect\" (according to a different FAO\n   source), where \"indirect\" means the North Koreans prepared a vaccine\n   from the sick birds and the vaccinated birds showed antibodies to H7.\n   \n   If the infection is with H7 subtype this would seem to be good news as\n   human cases with H7 have not been particularly severe. H7N2 has been\n   reported in poultry in the US (Delaware) and H7N7 caused a large\n   outbreak in poultry in 2003 in The Netherlands which jumped to humans.\n   Most cases manifested as conjunctivitis (\"pink eye\") and a small\n   number (3) showed typical influenza-like symptoms (cough, fever,\n   muscle aches). The only serious case involved a veterinarian who\n   visited one of the farms and developed fatal respiratory distress\n   syndrome.\n   \n   Relatively mild disease, yes. But the fly in the ointment is that this\n   avian virus also showed itself to be quite transmissible to and among\n   people. Eighty-three cases were reported initially among poultry\n   workers with three possible subsequent transmissions to family\n   members. A follow-up blood study with 500 farmers, their families and\n   workers involved in the massive cull initially showed no antibodies to\n   H7, even in those with confirmed infection. It turned out the\n   hemagglutination assay (to see if a subject's blood serum made red\n   blood cells clump together, a standard test for prior infection)\n   worked with horse red blood cells, not the standard turkey rbcs. Even\n   using horse rbcs, only about 50% of the previously infected patients\n   showed agglutination, still not very sensitive. Using the modified\n   assay, Dutch investigators estimated that at least 1000 and perhaps as\n   many as 2000 people may have been infected. More importantly, close\n   family contacts of poultry workers had a 59% seroprevalence of H7\n   antibodies, suggesting person to person transmission on large scale.\n   Some other pertinent technical results:\n\n     . . . having measurable antibodies was associated with having\n     conjunctivitis (RR 1.72; 95% CI 0.99-2.99), and a lower proportion\n     of the exposed persons who took prophylactic antiviral medication\n     developed antibodies (corrected OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.89).\n     \n\t Neither poultry farmers nor those engaged in controlling the\n     epidemic complied satisfactorily with preventive measures. Only 6%\n     of farmers reported consistent use of facial masks and 1% reported\n     consistent use of goggles while working with infected poultry. In\n     cullers, compliance was only slightly better: 25% consistently used\n     facial masks and 13% used goggles. The results of the\n     epidemiological study suggest that oseltamivir protected against\n     conjunctivitis (corrected OR=0.14; 95% CI=0.08C0.27) as well as\n     against infection without specific symptoms. No protective effect\n     was demonstrable for safety goggles or mouth-nose masks.\n\n   Meanwhile, the North Koreans are declaring the outbreak over (Right.\n   Maybe they want to sell me a bridge over the Yalu?). Even if true,\n   questions remain, as New Scientist notes:\n\n     But this is a mystery, as an outbreak of H7 has never been recorded\n     in east Asia before. The North Koreans say they have destroyed all\n     the sick chickens, and the outbreak is now over, says [the FAO\n     scientist]. Thats good for the Koreans. But wed like a sample of\n     tissue from the infected birds so we can isolate the virus.\n     A genetic sequence might help trace the strains origins, and\n     whether it has mixed with other Asian strains.\n\n   So the evidence has been destroyed? I'll bet it's still there. The\n   problem will be getting it before it migrates elsewhere.\n\n   \n   In epidemiology an effect is the endpoint of a causal mechanism. An\n       effect measure is anestimate of the influence of a particular\n       factor on a population's health. The Editors of Effect Measure are\n       seniorpublic health scientists and practitioners. Their names\n       wouldbe immediately recognizable to many in the public health\n       community.They prefer to keep their online and public lives\n       separate to allow maximum freedom of expression. Paul Revere was a\n       member of the first local Board of Health in the United States\n       (Boston, 1799). The Editors signtheir posts \"Revere\" to recognize\n       the public service of aprofessional forerunner better known for\n       other things."

        "articleBody": "PRODUCING BC IN WORDS AND IMAGES\r\n   Sharon's Web Journal for English 470D\r\n   \r\n\r\n    Thursday  |  September 12, 2002\r\n   Tanoo: 1941 Versus 1951\r\n\r\n\r\n   Our assignment for next class is to first read the Irwin edition of\r\n   Emily Carr's \"Tanoo,\" mull it over (preferably during a long walk),\r\n   then proceed to read the original, 1941 version. This process, assures\r\n   Dr. Martineau, will yield an interesting result.\r\n\r\n   Before sharing my insight, I'd like to make a comment about Carr's\r\n   stories. As I had already read past \"Tanoo\" for today's class, I would\r\n   need to re-read it once again. To peak my curiosity and hopefully\r\n   uncover some life facts about Carr, I read Ira Dilworth's foreword.\r\n   Dilworth writes about Carr's \"peeling\" of sentences to strip \"all\r\n   ambiguous and unnecessary worlds, replacing a vague word by a sharper,\r\n   clearer one until the sentence emerged clean and precise in its\r\n   meaning and strong in its impact on the reader.\" With this armed\r\n   knowledge, I found myself reading radically slower than usual,\r\n   sometimes rereading a sentence two, three, something even four times\r\n   trying to absorb, and reabsorb any uncaptured meanings like words of\r\n   gold. By reading this way, I caught passages I had previously missed.\r\n   In fact, it altered my first perception of the story. And after\r\n   reading the 1941 edition, my perception of the Irwin edition once\r\n   again altered, even more dramatically, this time.\r\n\r\n   The mentioning of the missionary's daughter accompanying Carr on her\r\n   excursion to Tanoo with Jimmie and Louisa, I thought, was Carr's way\r\n   of retelling in detail, every aspect of the trip. In fact, I found\r\n   both \"Ucluelet,\" the first story in the book, set in a tone where\r\n   missionaries were sympathetic and cordial with aboriginal peoples,\r\n   such as their interaction with the Chief (In \"Sophie\") and with Mrs.\r\n   Wynook. The notorious treatment of aboriginal families by European\r\n   missionaries is well-known. Missionaries, recalls Carr, laughed at the\r\n   tradition of totem poles, calling them heathenish. The missionary's\r\n   daughter, whom upholds a \"superior\" European culture, found Jimmie and\r\n   Louisa's habits savage-like, as shown in her refusal to try devilfish\r\n   and exclaiming Tanoo, a place of spiritual value, as a \"Horrid place!\"\r\n\r\n   I wonder why the later edition of \"Tanoo\" deletes certain passages,\r\n   notably those in which Europeans are sneering at the aboriginal way of\r\n   life. We know Carr is unbiased; she commit herself to understanding\r\n   Native culture. She does not directly judge the missionary's daughter,\r\n   introducing her as the missionary's \"pretty daughter.\" During the\r\n   story, Carr only goes as far as calling her \"Miss Missionary,\" perhaps\r\n   a sarcastic way of direct us to the pushiness of the girl. My belief\r\n   is that Carr's European audience met her work(s) with harsh criticism.\r\n   As a result, for profitability's sake, it is necessary to blot out\r\n   racial statements for Europeans' who look to Carr's books to acquire\r\n   knowledge about First Nations people."

        "articleBody": "Standing in the Way of Ceremony: Production Code Objections to The Bride of\r\nFrankenstein\r\n\r\n   The year was 1931. Universal was a struggling Hollywood studio.\r\n   Salvationcame from an unexpected place: the horror film. February saw\r\n   the blockbusterrelease of Dracula, and only eight months later\r\n   Frankensteinwas released to become an even bigger hit. Inevitably this\r\n   successled the studio to pursue a sequel, and in 1935 Universal\r\n   releasedThe Bride of Frankenstein, returning the director (JamesWhale)\r\n   and most of the original cast. The film was a spectacular successat\r\n   the box office. What the average 1935 movie-goer saw in the\r\n   theater,though, was a film heavily tweaked from the original script\r\n   Whalehad been pursuing. Unlike its predecessor, The Bride of\r\n   Frankensteinwas exposed to the heavy hand of Joe Breen and the\r\n   Production CodeAdministration; a review of the shooting script and\r\n   notes Breen wroteto the producers reveal forced alterations that\r\n   change the natureof the film and its characters.\r\n   When the original Frankenstein was released in 1931 the ProductionCode\r\n   had not yet been put into enforcement. Censorship was yet thedominion\r\n   of various local and state film boards. Though these groupscut various\r\n   scenes from the screened prints of the original, therewas no federal\r\n   censorship to deal with until the film's re-releasein 1937 (Manguel\r\n   14). Bride of Frankenstein, however, hadto deal with the Production\r\n   Code Administration from the beginning.Many cases of censorship\r\n   centered around the depiction of the femaleform and sexuality, but for\r\n   the most part the issues raised in Brideof Frankenstein were ones of\r\n   violence and religion.\r\n   Breen, as a devout Catholic, was especially sensitive to\r\n   unfavorableportrayals of religion in the movies. In this film Breen\r\n   was especiallyworried by any scenes that would compare Frankenstein to\r\n   God. Veryearly on in the process he cautioned the studio against\r\n   pursuing thisobvious analogy. ``Throughout the script there are a\r\n   number ofreferences to Frankenstein ... which compare him to God and\r\n   whichcompare his creation of the monster to God's creation of man.''\r\n   HereBreen was blunt: ``All such references should be deleted''\r\n   (Gardner66). The subject matter was too tied to the comparison for\r\n   such anultimatum to be completely followed, however, and a\r\n   back-and-forthon the topic went on throughout the production process.\r\n   In one sceneof the shooting script Frankenstein intensely monologues:\r\n   ``I couldhave bred a race and have found perhaps the secret of eternal\r\n   life.All that was in my brain -- my very grasp. I conceived it -- it\r\n   waslike being God!'' (Riley B-7) Predictably, Joe Breen was not\r\n   amused.He suggested omitting the line, saying that it had in the past\r\n   ``provensomewhat blasphemous'' (Gardner 67). Whaler responded by\r\n   offeringto refer to ``being the Creator'' instead, but in the end\r\n   theoffered proved moot as the entire line was cut from the\r\n   theatricalprint. Later in the sequence Dr. Pretorius was to derisively\r\n   tellFrankenstein to ``follow the lead of Nature ... or of God -- ifyou\r\n   are fond of your fairy tales'' (Riley B-26). Breen wanted theline cut;\r\n   Whaler instead changed ``fairy tales'' to ``Biblestories.''\r\n   Another religiously oriented cut provides a good example of the wayin\r\n   which Code-required cuts could alter the attitude of a scene.\r\n   Whilerunning from a pursuing mob Frankenstein's monster happens into\r\n   acemetery. The script called for the monster to happen upon an\r\n   ``imposingmonument'' depicting Christ on the cross (F-8). The monster,\r\n   in ashow of compassion, tries to help the stricken figure, thinking\r\n   itto be a human mistreated as he has been. The monster's effort endsup\r\n   toppling the monument, revealing the crypt entrance below.\r\n   Breenobjected to the scene, saying that Whaler ``should omit the\r\n   figureof the statue of the Christ from this scene, substituting some\r\n   othertype of monument'' (Gardner 67). Changing the monument,\r\n   however,changes how the audience views the monster's actions. Instead\r\n   of attemptingto be compassionate, the monster is instead shown lashing\r\n   out at arandom statue, toppling it in an act that is far more\r\n   aggressive thanthe original was to be. Though Breen meant only to\r\n   prevent a conservativepublic from finding offense in the scene, the\r\n   effect of his actionwas to force upon the monster an entirely\r\n   different motivation.\r\n   Aside from depictions of religion, Breen was primarily concerned\r\n   withthe gruesomeness and violence the film promised. Even after\r\n   primaryshooting had ended Breen wrote to Universal warning them that\r\n   thefilm would not get its seal as it then stood. ``This picture\r\n   seemsto us definitely to be a violation of our Production Code,'' he\r\n   wrotethem, ``because of its excessive brutality and\r\n   gruesomeness''(69). Scenes already filmed were targeted for removal.\r\n   Early in thefilm a man and his wife are left standing by the burning\r\n   wreckageof the mill as the crowd that watched the monster destroyed\r\n   wandersoff. The man moves closer, wanting his eyes to confirm for him\r\n   thatthe monster was truly dead. Instead the man falls into the water\r\n   belowand comes face-to-face with a monster very much alive. The man\r\n   iskilled, and as the monster crawls up to the surface the wife is\r\n   broughtto a similar fate. The script gave a scene in which the drama\r\n   betweenmonster and man unfolded slowly; Breen wanted the man's\r\n   drowning togo unshown. He also wanted deleted the shot of the monster\r\n   pullingthe wife into the water. He won one and lost one, as Universal\r\n   cutthe drowning scene but kept the image of the wife being tossed\r\n   toher death. Later there is a scene where the monster kills a\r\n   smallgirl. This body is viewed by a group of ``little girls coming\r\n   outof church in their white dresses'' and later carried through\r\n   thestreets by the mother. The final print of the film still\r\n   containedthe shot of the girls viewing the off-camera body, but cut\r\n   the onethat would have shown the body itself (69).\r\n   Breen was concerned not just with visuals that might upset the\r\n   public,but dialogue choices as well. The opening shots of the film\r\n   originallyincluded a scene where Mary Shelley says that she, her poet\r\n   husband,and Lord Byron are ``all three infidels, scoffers at all\r\n   marriageties, believing only in living fully and freely in whatever\r\n   directionthe heart dictates'' (Riley A-5). The line, along with most\r\n   of thosemeant for these three, was cut completely from the theatrical\r\n   print.Elsewhere Breen got detailed enough to be squirmish about the\r\n   word``entrails,'' getting it replaced with ``insides.''\r\n   (Gardner67-68). Breen also took objection to the idea of the monster\r\n   as asexual creature. Reviewing an early script he wrote that\r\n   ``themonster's use of the word ``mate'' should be dropped in this\r\n   scene.All material which suggests he desires a sexual companion is\r\n   objectionable.We suggest you substitute the word ``companion'''' (66).\r\n   In theend the monster does refer to his soon-to-be-created partner as\r\n   a``wife,'' though whether this implies more or less of a\r\n   sexualconnotation than mate is debatable (Riley F-16).\r\n   Only a few of the scenes censored in Bride of Frankensteininvolved\r\n   sexuality. In the scene where Dr. Pretorius shows Frankensteinhis\r\n   created miniature creatures, one of the jars contains a tiny\r\n   mermaid.Breen wrote that, ``The scene of the miniature mermaid should\r\n   behandled in such a way as to avoid any improper exposure''\r\n   (Gardner67). The shooting script made gave no guidance on what the\r\n   mermaidshould look like, but the final release made sure the mermaid\r\n   waswell-clothed. Cut entirely from the film were scenes in which\r\n   MaryShelley was considered to be showing too much of her breasts.\r\n   Breen'smemo after photography had finished tersely demanded that the\r\n   studio``Delete all the ``breast shots'' in Reel 1'' (69). Theseshots\r\n   went, and their late removal might have been part of the reasonso much\r\n   of the dialogue from these scenes was gutted.\r\n   The ending of the film was also changed after primary shooting\r\n   hadended, though in this case changes were due more to Universal's\r\n   concernthat the film have a happy ending than to any censorship\r\n   concerns.Where the shooting script has Frankenstein and Elizabeth\r\n   dying alongsidethe Doctor and their almost-human creations, the final\r\n   theatricalprint does not. The principals were brought back to reshoot\r\n   an endingin which the monster allows Frankenstein and Elizabeth to\r\n   leave thetower before its destruction. However refilming the entire\r\n   sequencewas too costly and in the final shot before the tower is\r\n   destroyedFrankenstein is seen still inside, even though just\r\n   previously hehad been shown to leave.\r\n   In the end Breen gave Bride of Frankenstein a seal despitethe fact\r\n   that it had not addressed all the objections he had raised.Just\r\n   because the Production Code Administration signed off on thefilm did\r\n   not mean the rest of the way was smooth sailing, though.Breen warned\r\n   Universal to expect trouble with other censoring agencies:\r\n\r\n     It is more than likely that this picture will meet with\r\n     considerablydifficulty at the hands of [state and local] censor\r\n     boards bothin this country and abroad. The nature of the production\r\n     is such asto invite very critical examination on the part of these\r\n     censor boards,and you may well expect difficulty with it wherever\r\n     the picture isshown (71).\r\n\r\n   Breen's warning proved to be absolutely correct. A few states didmake\r\n   cuts to the film, but primarily trouble came when the productionwas\r\n   shown abroad. The film was gutted in several countries and\r\n   bannedoutright in a few others.\r\n   Despite its censorship troubles, Bride of Frankenstein was an\r\n   enormousfiscal success. Audiences were able to look past the plot\r\n   holes introducedby the many minutes of footage cut after filming and\r\n   find a compellinghorror film. Today many of Breen's cuts look petty\r\n   and the remainingcontent entirely tame, but to the audience of the\r\n   time this was anamazing film. The Production Code Administration\r\n   greatly affectedthe cinema of its time, and in Bride of Frankenstein\r\n   youcan see how the required changes altered the tone and character\r\n   ofthe film.\r\n\r\nWorks Cited\r\n\r\n   Gardner, Gerald.

        "articleBody": "SyriaComment.com \r\n\r\n   Thoughts on Syrian politics, history and religion.\r\n\r\nTuesday, April 19, 2005\r\n\r\nNews Round Up\r\n\r\n   Up Date (April 21): A well informed Washington-based Syria-analyst\r\n   wrote me the following about the \"Assad has been Written Off\" article\r\n   quoted below.\r\n\r\n     About your column of today, I can tell you, privately, that the\r\n     view of Syria expressed in the news article you cite is not widely\r\n     shared among US analysts of the ME. It may reflect a political\r\n     decision by the administration to marginalize Bashar, but the idea\r\n     that he is viewed as living on borrowed time is not held at the\r\n     level of working analysts.\r\n\r\n   US: ASSAD HAS BEEN WRITTEN OFF\r\n   Ma'ariv by Ben Caspit\r\n   (Thanks to Timur Goksel of AUB for sending this to me. Anyone who\r\n   thinks the Syrian regime is on the verge of collapse hasn't been in\r\n   Syria for some time. Interesting for the spin though. There is no\r\n   organized opposition in Syria. Notions that President Asad is not in\r\n   the loop seem silly to me. Certainly, he is not the only power in\r\n   Syria, to which he alludes when he claims not to be a dictator, but\r\n   that is far from suggesting that he is not the principal power.)\r\n\r\n     The US administration believes that the Alawite regime in Syria is\r\n     on the verge of collapse, and that SyrianPresident Bashar Assad\r\n     will not survive for long after the pullout of Syrian forces from\r\n     Lebanon is completed-this was indicated by talks held by Prime\r\n     Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington this week.\r\n     This assessment, which was originally reached by the CIA, is\r\n     sharedby all leading government officials, ranging from President\r\n     George Bushand Vice President Dick Cheney, to Secretary of State\r\n     Condoleezza Rice and other officials.\r\n     The talks indicate that the Americans have written off President\r\n     Assad; as far as they are concerned he does not exist, and they are\r\n     already looking ahead and planning the day after the fall of the\r\n     Syrian regime and the end of the Alawite minority rule in Damascus.\r\n     From the American viewpoint, Bashar Assad has in fact taken over\r\n     the dubious position left open by Yasser Arafat, and is now\r\n     disqualified andwritten off in precisely the manner that the\r\n     Americans wrote off Arafat before him. The reasons for this are\r\n     varied: the Syrian double game with regard to terrorism, the role\r\n     that the Syrians are playing in Iraq, the Syrian conduct in Lebanon\r\n     and the general Syrian functioning vis-a-vis the US administration.\r\n     In closed conversations, the Americans, including President Bush,\r\n     say that Assad is a \"peculiar fellow\" who cannot be counted on,\r\n     hopes cannot be pinned on him, and [the US] should wait until he\r\n     disappears from the political scene. The administration believes\r\n     that the Syrian people are ripe to begin a democratic process. \"In\r\n     Syria too, people are aware of what is happening around the world\r\n     and in the region,\" say the Americans. On the other hand, officials\r\n     in Washington express grave concern with regard to what is expected\r\n     in Lebanon. It is feared that\r\n     following the Syrian pullout and the beginning of the democratic\r\n     process, Lebanon will undergo an internal collapse due to the high\r\n     level of internal ethnic tension in the country.\r\n\r\n   \"The EU adds to Syria's international woes: Brussels links Euro-med\r\n   accord with damascus' politics in lebanon,\" writes Will Rasmussen of\r\n   the Daily Star, April 08, 2005.\r\n   The EU finally broke cover this week in announcing it will not sign a\r\n   billion-dollar trade pact with Syria until key European demands on\r\n   Lebanon are met. The EU has insisted on a full withdrawal from Lebanon\r\n   and parliamentary elections without interference from Syria.\r\n   Without the deal, the Syrian economy will lose an important lifeline,\r\n   but more importantly, the EU's decision signals that the international\r\n   isolation of the Syrian government will increase.\r\n   Syria had hoped that signing the agreement, which gives Damascus\r\n   greater access to EU markets, would drive a wedge between Europe and\r\n   America.\r\n   Demanding that Syria tighten its borders with Iraq and stop supporting\r\n   anti-Israel groups such as Hizbullah, the U.S. has imposed a raft of\r\n   sanctions on Damascus, which does not mean much economically, but puts\r\n   a political squeeze on Syrian President Bashar Assad.\r\n   Europe, though, continued to pursue a different strategy of engagement\r\n   with Syria, even initialing the trade pact last October - a month\r\n   after Resolution 1559 was passed. The association agreement involves\r\n   billions of dollars of aid to Damascus as well as the creation of an\r\n   EU-Syrian free trade zone.\r\n   But finally, the EU seems to have lost patience, as The Daily Star\r\n   first predicted last month.\r\n   Frank Hesske, EU ambassador to Syria, said this week: \"I don't see how\r\n   we could consider a signature earlier than ... fulfillment of these\r\n   two conditions: full, verifiable withdrawal of troops and intelligence\r\n   services and the issue of what we really see on the ground, free,\r\n   transparent elections or not.\"\r\n   The deal is still in administrative limbo, awaiting translation of its\r\n   1,500 pages into EU languages. It must be unanimously passed by all 25\r\n   EU members and could be signed at the earliest by June. Syria has a\r\n   positive trade balance with the EU of about $1 billion, largely due to\r\n   its petroleum exports, but its economy is suffering from a negative\r\n   growth rate and high unemployment.\r\n   When The Daily Star first queried European officials last month, they\r\n   hinted that signing the agreement would be contingent on whether Syria\r\n   withdraws its troops from Lebanon.\r\n   But the Europeans are expanding their scope and toughening their line\r\n   against Damascus. Now, they're insisting on a second condition: that\r\n   Syria respects free and transparent elections in Lebanon, which the\r\n   Lebanese opposition is already accusing the Syrian-backed Karami\r\n   government of delaying.\r\n   Last week, the EU enraged Damascus by inviting Syrian opposition\r\n   leader Farid Ghadry, who recently met top U.S. State Department\r\n   officials in Washington, to Brussels to argue his case for why the\r\n   agreement should be delayed.\r\n   Ghadry, who heads the Reform Party of Syria, said the treaty shouldn't\r\n   be ratified until Syria improves its human rights record and\r\n   introduces democratic reforms.\r\n   According to Ghadry, the trade agreement is a key opportunity to\r\n   pressure Damascus, which is the only country in the Euro-Mediterranean\r\n   Partnership - which brings together 25 EU countries and their 12\r\n   Mediterranean neighbors - not to sign an agreement.\r\n   \"The regime of Assad is desperate to sign the agreement because it\r\n   shows that it can isolate the Europeans from the Americans,\" Ghadry\r\n   told The Daily Star.\r\n   Ghadry said: \"Not only will it give Syria an economic boost that we\r\n   think will again only benefit the elite but it will also give the\r\n   regime a political boost, something the Reform Party of Syria does not\r\n   want at this time.\r\n   \"The EU trade with Syria represents approximately 40 percent of\r\n   Syria's GDP, so it's very important for them.\"\r\n   Ghadry urged the EU to leverage the trade agreement not just to free\r\n   Lebanon from Assad's grip but to improve its human rights record.\r\n   \"The only reform possible is the lifting of the emergency laws,\r\n   release of all prisoners, changing the Constitution to accept all\r\n   political parties and dismantling the intelligence services,\" said\r\n   Ghadry.\r\n   \"If these are done, then we can start a meaningful dialogue to\r\n   transition the country into a full-fledged democracy.\"\r\n   Ghadry's demands are further than the EU has signaled it is willing to\r\n   push. It doesn't seem likely, though, that the agreement will be\r\n   signed before June, when the EU presidency changes hands and new\r\n   political priorities could come into play.\r\n   Until then, Syria's pariah status will continue, unless, of course, it\r\n   shows a willingness to cooperate fully in Lebanon.\r\n\r\n     Daily Press Briefing\r\n     Tom Casey, Director, Office of Press Relations\r\n     Washington, DC\r\n     April 15, 2005\r\n     QUESTION: Asharq al-Awsat newspaper said today that President Bush\r\n     will not\r\n     deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S. is not\r\n     pleased at\r\n     all from the Syria's policies. How do you characterize the\r\n     relations between\r\n     the U.S. and Syria?\r\n     MR. CASEY: Well, I think our relations with Syria right now are\r\n     very much\r\n     focused on ensuring that Syria complies with all the terms and\r\n     obligations\r\n     of Resolution 1559. Beyond that, we have made clear, very clear,\r\n     some of our\r\n     other concerns about Syria, including its support for terrorism,\r\n     including\r\n     its housing of those involved or associated with terrorist groups\r\n     in\r\n     Damascus, including our concerns about what Syria is doing or, more\r\n     importantly, isn't doing to shut off the flow of potential\r\n     insurgents across\r\n     the border with Iraq.\r\n     So, obviously, we have many, many concerns with Syria right now.\r\n     The Syrians\r\n     certainly know what they are. We've spoken to them about it on a\r\n     regular\r\n     basis and we're certainly looking for action not only on 1559 but\r\n     on all\r\n     those other issues.\r\n\r\n      \r\n\r\n22 Comments:\r\n\r\n   Anonymous said...\r\n          Hey joshua\r\n          i have probably checked ur site 60 times in last 10-12 days cuz\r\n          was very curious to see what u found in ur trips to lebanon,\r\n          suwaida and qamishli....hope u got a few things to say about ur\r\n          trip\r\n          cheers\r\n          Syrian in canada\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n   Anonymous said...\r\n          There is no organized opposition thanks to eradication policy\r\n          against syrian political parties.\r\n          We can also say that there is no Baath party because it's not\r\n          more a Mafia united in the name of economic privilege.\r\n          The true power in Syria is the security apparatus dominated by\r\n          allawi clans linked to the Assad Family.\r\n          Because of the weakness of this regime i'm pessimistic about\r\n          any radical reform in Syria led by the dictator Assad junior.\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n   Ghassan said...\r\n          Joshua,\r\n          I was looking forward to read your posting following your\r\n          travel in Syria.

I really like to hear what\r\n          the PEOPLE IN SYRIA (government, politicians, economists and\r\n          ordinary people) are thinking!\r\n          I agree with Anonymous At 7:29 PM that due to the eradication\r\n          and threat policy against Syrian politicians there is no\r\n          organized opposition. Don't be deceived that there is no\r\n          opposition. It smells like what happened to Saddam when he\r\n          surrounded himself with yes sir men who lied to him just to\r\n          either get rewarded with money and power or to be protected\r\n          from his oppression. Assad, Jr. is surrounded by the same type\r\n          men who are lying to him by telling him every Syrian and\r\n          Lebanese loves you! It is typical of dictators to have that\r\n          kind of people around them to make them feel good about\r\n          themselves! My advice to Assad, Jr. is to do his best to allow\r\n          the Syrians to express themselves freely. One more analogy, the\r\n          Japanese car makers in the late 1970s allowed their employees\r\n          to provide opinions and suggestions about how to design and\r\n          build cars. In few years, they improved the quality of their\r\n          cars and lowered its cost which led them to control the US auto\r\n          market! The big three companies in Detroit refused to change\r\n          and their share of the US auto market plummeted! Look around\r\n          you, read history and learn from it Dr. Assad before YOU become\r\n          history!\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n   Anonymous said...\r\n          Josh,did you read my email of 6 april with 2 attachments,now\r\n          once i recive ur acknowledgment i have the 3ed attach. to\r\n          complete the the ring ,thus the expected metmorphises drift to\r\n          save the present seen on a new politecal party look that may\r\n          prolong the dynasty under an accepted nationalstic ideology,ur\r\n          half way there,but ur missing the linck.\r\n          \r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n   Anonymous said...\r\n          I dont think the syrians want to get rid of one dictator for\r\n          another puppet.

If\r\n          the border is closed there will be an economical catastrophe on\r\n          the two sides and nobody can affords this.\r\n          A more important middle-term threat to Bashar would be a\r\n          liberal Lebanese government.

Most\r\n          syrian are familiar with lebanese newspapers and reforms in\r\n          Lebanon are likely to amplify the demand for reforms in Syria.\r\n          If a syrian opposition reorganize on lebanese soil, this could\r\n          prove a real threat to Syria.

The next Lebanese elections (if they are held) will be\r\n          \"clean\" and Assad will be off the hook.

They reasserted Syria's\r\n          independence and took control of Syria away from Cairo.\r\n          But Elwan was one of the Syrian officers still loyal to Nasser.\r\n          Unhappy with the rejection of Egyptian rule, he attempted to\r\n          overthrow the Damascus government.\r\n          He failed, and fled to Egypt. He was sentenced to death in\r\n          absentia.\r\n          But moderate young leader Bashar Al-Assad is trying to rewrite\r\n          his father's history by encouraging the return of political\r\n          refugees. Elwan was issued with a Syrian passport, and returned\r\n          home. He was met at Damascus Airport by Human Rights Lawyer and\r\n          opposition activist Hassan Abdel-Azim.\r\n          Ammar recently wrote that all exiles have a duty to return and\r\n          reshape Syria, and play an active part in the politics of their\r\n          country.\r\n          Abdel-Azim is now calling for all political prisoners to be\r\n          released. Last month the Syrian Ambassador to the US said that\r\n          by the summer Syria's prisons would not house a single\r\n          political prisoner. At the same time the President released 312\r\n          Kurdish political detainees.

It is certain that there will not be a PLO-style\r\n          syrian opposition in Lebanon, but there could be a democratic\r\n          opposition enjoying freedom of expression in Lebanon.\r\n          Unlike the palestinian example, the threat would not come from\r\n          the Syrian opposition itself but rather from the Syrian\r\n          government reaction to it. I doubt that Bashar will appreciate\r\n          to see a Syrian opposition a few kilometers away from Damascus.\r\n          I don't think anyone in Lebanon wants to have tensions with the\r\n          syrian government. So I doubt that the syrian opposition will\r\n          be allowed to operate from Lebanon.\r\n\r\n           \r\n\r\n   Anonymous said...\r\n          Your Washington friend said:\"About your column of today, I can\r\n          tell you, privately, that the view of Syria expressed in the\r\n          news article you cite is not widely shared among US analysts of\r\n          the ME.\"\r\n          I, for one, am very heartened to hear that.

Sadly, this matter often finds little support\r\n          about the people of the middle east themselves, either out of\r\n          ignorance or out of plain indifference to a phenomenon they\r\n          have come to view as collateral damage to the regimes in power.\r\n          I would like to turn the attention of syrian citizens to the\r\n          plight of teh lEbanese mothers and spouses whose sons have been\r\n          the victim of forced disappearance by the assad regime for the\r\n          last 25 years or so.

When first sending\r\n   your packet to departments, ask for a faculty list with research\r\n   interests, so you will know with whom you are dealing.\r\n\r\nQuestions you are likely to be asked many times\r\n\r\n   1. Tell me about your thesis.\r\n\r\n            Prepare a five minute talk. Sound enthusiastic! Realize that\r\n   most of your interviewers know little about your field, so provide\r\n   lots of motivation for your study. Practice the talk with friends\r\n   before the meetings.\r\n\r\n            Prepare answers to the three or four most frequent questions\r\n   and criticisms of your work.\r\n\r\n            Prepare a few thoughts about further research concerning\r\n   your thesis.\r\n\r\n   2. When do you think you will finish your dissertation?\r\n\r\n   Your odds of landing a job are higher if you can convincingly argue\r\n   you will be done by June (best) or at least by September. Employers do\r\n   not like new assistant professors to arrive with unfinished\r\n   dissertations (although many such assistant professors exist).\r\n\r\n   3. What are you thinking about working on next?\r\n\r\n   Describe one or two research projects that you would like to work on\r\n   next. You don't need to carry out these exact projects. You can\r\n   include extensions of your thesis: ideas it has spawned, or tests of\r\n   it you will someday do. At least one idea should be distinct from your\r\n   thesis. On the other hand, don't be scattered. Most of your ideas\r\n   should hang together, as if you were writing a book or two.\r\n\r\n   4. What courses would you like to teach?\r\n\r\n   Be sure to know the needs of the department before answering this one.\r\n   Mention undergrad and grad courses, and perhaps an advanced grad\r\n   course. The advanced courses are sought after; don't sound as if you\r\n   demand to teach one. Mention a service course (intro, micro, or macro)\r\n   that you are willing to teach.\r\n\r\n   Know the text you might use in the course, particularly for\r\n   undergraduates. (You can ask around for plausible texts, and perhaps\r\n   reading lists.) Think about an outline of topics for one or two\r\n   courses.\r\n\r\nQuestions to ask\r\n\r\n   The interviews are also for you to find out things. Also, asking\r\n   questions shows you are interested, and fills gaps in the conversation\r\n   that the incompetent interviewers leave when they run out of things to\r\n   say. Do not discuss money. There is lots of time for that.\r\n\r\n   Facilities: library, research assistants, computers,\r\n   research institutes, etc.\r\n\r\n   Teaching:\r\n\r\n   o       Load: anything above four quarters or 3 semesters a year is\r\n   heavy, below that is light.\r\n\r\n   o       Likely courses you would teach\r\n\r\n   o       The choice you would have\r\n\r\n            Possible to create your own course?\r\n\r\n   o       Quality of students: undergrad and grad\r\n\r\n   Faculty:\r\n\r\n   o       Size, interests, mix of fields\r\n\r\n            Visit faculty web pages to find out who is in your field\r\n   beforehand.\r\n\r\n            Department: direction it is going, research vs. teaching,\r\n\r\n   Later in the process you can ask about:\r\n\r\n   o       Class size, TA's, readers, undergrad vs. grad\r\n\r\n   o       Summer money and travel money\r\n\r\n   o       Tenure patterns (% assistants who get tenured)\r\n\r\n   o       Secretary, photocopy and phone rules, parking\r\n\r\n            These sound minor, but can be important in the long run\r\n\r\n   o       Personal computer and printer; access to a larger research\r\n   machine\r\n\r\n   o       Housing help: search, mortgage, faculty housing, flybacks to\r\n   look for housing\r\n\r\n   o       Research assistant\r\n\r\n   o       Reduced teaching load first year\r\n\r\n   o       Minimize # of preparations (separate courses) you teach in one\r\n   year\r\n\r\n   o       Any grants that are available.

Interviewers are\r\n   looking for (1) people who would accept an offer, and (2) nice\r\n   colleagues. The first consideration implies that you should have a\r\n   reason why the interviewer's school is really your first choice (\"Oh,\r\n   I just love -40 in winter and searing heat in summer,\" she explained\r\n   to the Minnesotans). The second point implies that you must be\r\n   friendly, witty, and easygoing (during the high-pressure meetings!).\r\n   Nothing is more important than being friendly and collegial. They are\r\n   looking for someone they would like to have lunch with every day-this\r\n   dominates most other criteria.\r\n\r\n   This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

Feel free to circulate to anyone who\r\n   might find them useful.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n   Write to David Levine, Haas School of Business, University of\r\n   California, Berkeley CA 94720; levine@haas.berkeley.edu for additional\r\n   Cheap Advice, or to give Cheap Advice back to the source. Feedback is\r\n   always appreciated.\r\n\r\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice:\r\n\r\nWriting a Dissertation\r\n\r\n   I was trained as a graduate student to read other people's research.\r\n   Then I finished my special field exams and was told to go write some\r\n   research. I compare my experience to learning how to read literature,\r\n   then being asked to do creative writing. Not unrelated, but hardly the\r\n   same set of skills. Here is some advice I found helpful when I was\r\n   searching for a topic.\r\n\r\n   Hints for finding paper topics: Choosing a paper topic requires\r\n   balancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility\r\n   involves tractability for theoretical research, and data availability\r\n   for empirical research. I recommend creating a number of one-page\r\n   paper proposals, each with a topic sentence and data source.\r\n\r\n   There are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics.\r\n   One way is to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint\r\n   at the style, political point of view, level of abstraction, and\r\n   methods that are appropriate for you.\r\n\r\n   Other paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find\r\n   statements by policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you\r\n   angry, and find data sets to address the issue. When studying for\r\n   exams, keep a list of stupid things you read to return to during the\r\n   dissertation stage.\r\n\r\n   Don't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data\r\n   set what others have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas\r\n   are data-driven: read codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if\r\n   certain questions spark ideas or tests of theories you find\r\n   interesting. For every paper you read, think what else you would have\r\n   done with that dataset or methodology.\r\n\r\n   Write a paper, not a dissertation. A dissertation can be a daunting\r\n   prospect. If possible, focus on a 25-page paper with a clear\r\n   one-sentence topic. If you like this paper, then it can become the\r\n   basis of a dissertation. I promise you that just about any topic can\r\n   grow to 150 pages; nearly all topics students first choose are WAY too\r\n   broad.\r\n\r\n   A dissertation is any stack of papers with three signatures on the top\r\n   sheet. Paul Samuelson's dissertation was modestly entitled Foundations\r\n   of Economics. It lived up to that title, and remains a classic to this\r\n   day. I initially felt that my dissertation should be, if not that\r\n   good, at least vaguely comparable in the sense of answering one of the\r\n   Big Questions.\r\n\r\n   Do not fall prey, as I did, to the \"magnum opus fallacy\". A\r\n   dissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency.\r\n   Save the big thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when\r\n   you are a professor, and are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate\r\n   the smallest useful chunk of the Big Project with your dissertation\r\n   advisers, and do that single piece of research.\r\n\r\n   A dissertation group is essential. Having folks to bounce your ideas\r\n   off of at an early stage is irreplaceable. The members of your\r\n   dissertation group do not need to have similar fields; any smart\r\n   person will be useful at each stage of a project, from vague ideas\r\n   through research design, and write up. All you need are people who are\r\n   willing to listen to raw ideas, and willing to read first \"pre-drafts\"\r\n   of chapters.\r\n\r\n   This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice. Collect\r\n   them all! Dazzle your friends! Feel free to circulate to anyone who\r\n   might find them useful.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n   Write to David Levine, Haas School of Business, University of\r\n   California, Berkeley CA 94720; levine@haas.berkeley.edu for additional\r\n   Cheap Advice, or to give Cheap Advice back to the source. Feedback is\r\n   always appreciated.\r\n\r\nDavid Levine's\r\n\r\nCheap Advice for New Faculty\r\n\r\n   When people evaluate you for tenure, they need to know (1) who you\r\n   are, and (2) what (one or two sentences) results you are associated\r\n   with. Thus, my basic advice is focus your research, get it read, and\r\n   get seen. Sadly, the visibility of yourself is as important as the\r\n   quality of your work in professional success.\r\n\r\n   Have a theme: You should think of your research as writing a book, not\r\n   articles. The idea is that your first five years' research should\r\n   involve one or two unifying themes.\r\n\r\n   The reason for sticking to a theme is that people evaluating you need\r\n   to be able to say \"This young scholar is one of the world's experts at\r\n   _______.\" You get to fill the blank. However, your work must hold\r\n   together so that there is some word or phrase they can stick in the\r\n   blank.\r\n\r\n   In an ideal world, academics would be able to study any important\r\n   topic they were competent to shed light on. In the real world,\r\n   assistant professors are being evaluated; you don't need to play the\r\n   game I describe, but now you know the rules.\r\n\r\n   Get read: List people who should read your papers. The list should\r\n   include at least three groups: a dozen or so senior people in your\r\n   field who are likely to write letters evaluating you when you go up\r\n   for tenure; classmates and other buddies who are likely to actually\r\n   read the stuff; and people who work on related topics and you would\r\n   like to cite your stuff. Make up a master list that receives most\r\n   papers, and modify it for each paper. Look at each paper's\r\n   bibliography for ideas on who might want to see it. (Everyone wants to\r\n   see papers that cite them -- that's why so many professors read papers\r\n   from the back.)\r\n\r\n   Typically you should mail out papers in their working paper stage, one\r\n   draft before submission.\r\n\r\n   Feedback is crucial. All research has flaws, and all drafts have\r\n   easy-to-correct flaws. Make sure your research and writing has lots of\r\n   feedback to fix both types. Especially for the clarity issues, be open\r\n   minded. If your parents, friends, colleagues in unrelated disciplines,\r\n   will read the sucker, send it to them!\r\n\r\n   Get seen: Travel every year to give seminars. If you are going to be\r\n   near a university, call up six months early and tell them you are\r\n   available and would like to give a seminar.\r\n\r\n   Don't be shy: figure out how to give a talk at your field's annual\r\n   convention, and do it! Invite a mix of friends and more well-known\r\n   people.\r\n\r\n   Learn how to be a Manager: Secretaries and research assistants are\r\n   just a few of the people you need to learn to manage. The secrets are\r\n   few: respect and communication. Respect is shown, for example, by\r\n   asking their schedule when you propose work, and by always saying,\r\n   \"Thank you.\" In addition, if they have expertise in a job, only give\r\n   advice on how to do it if they ask.\r\n\r\n   Most attempts at communication are not completely successful. (In the\r\n   classroom this problem is reflected in my maxim: \"I can teach faster\r\n   than they can learn.\") Thus, the golden rule of communication is \"Say\r\n   unto others what you believe others have said unto you.\" After giving\r\n   your instructions, always ask your RA to explain what she thought you\r\n   asked her to do. (Do this in a way that makes it clear you consider\r\n   yourself at fault for any miscommunication. Perhaps: \"I didn't explain\r\n   that very well. Can you tell me what you are planning to do?\") If they\r\n   don't repeat back to me their understanding of my instructions, then\r\n   it is unlikely the job will be accomplished as I expect.\r\n\r\n   Budget your research time: In economics research begun in year t\r\n   usually leads to a first draft in year t+1 or t+2. Circulating it and\r\n   presenting it at a seminar or two brings us to year t+3. Submit it to\r\n   a journal and they will (if you are lucky) ask for a revision in year\r\n   t+4, which you might complete that year. If so, they could accept it\r\n   as fast as year t+5, but it might not come out till year t+6. On the\r\n   one hand, many papers can move from conception to publication in less\r\n   than six years; on the other hand, many papers take more.\r\n\r\n   Count back from the time you need to submit your tenure file. If you\r\n   are three years away and your case is less than 100% solid, don't\r\n   begin any new research! At this point your priority must be to move\r\n   working papers and papers with requested revisions into the Accepted\r\n   pile.\r\n\r\n   This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

Dazzle your friends!\r\n\r\n  \r\n   Write to David Levine, Haas School of Business, University of\r\n   California, Berkeley CA 94720; levine@haas.berkeley.edu for additional\r\n   Cheap Advice, or to give Cheap Advice back to the source. Feedback is\r\n   always appreciated.\r\n\r\nDavid Levine's Cheap Advice:\r\n\r\nHow to Present Results\r\n\r\nPresenting Your Results\r\n\r\n   Authors must work hard to make their results easy to follow. Thus,\r\n   tables must be comprehensible by themselves. That is, a reader should\r\n   be able to understand a table without reference to the text (and\r\n   preferably without reference to other tables). The converse rule is\r\n   that the text should stand by itself, even if a reader ignores the\r\n   tables.\r\n\r\n   Variable names should be self-explanatory. The text should flow\r\n   without ever showing that the reader has encountered a variable name.\r\n   For example, \"Each plant visit by a social scientist corresponded to\r\n   3.1% higher voluntary turnover per month (SE = .9%, P < .05)\" is much\r\n   better than \"The coefficient of SCISTUD on VOLTUR was .031 (.009),\"\r\n   which is better than \"S and V were significantly related.\" In short,\r\n   nobody should know what passed between you and your computer in the\r\n   middle of the night. Name your dummy variable Male or Female, but not\r\n   Sex.\r\n\r\n   Often variables are proxies for conceptual variables. If you want to\r\n   measure complexity, but your variable is log(employment), name the\r\n   variable employment (if all variables are expressed in logs) or\r\n   log(employment), not complexity.\r\n\r\n   Each table has number and a meaningful title: \"Wages Do Not Rise with\r\n   Tenure,\" not \"Wages.\"\r\n\r\n   All statistical tests include the name of the test, the test\r\n   statistic, and the significance level. Include a brief description of\r\n   complex procedures at the bottom of the table. Remind readers of the\r\n   meaning of complicated variables.\r\n\r\n   Each estimated equation lists the dependent variable and sample size.\r\n   If one of these is constant for an entire table, list it only once.\r\n   Always include measures of goodness of fit such as R or\r\n   log-likelihood. Usually include a test of the significance of the\r\n   entire regression (such as an F test for ordinary least squares), and\r\n   appropriate residual diagnostics (such as Durbin-Watson statistics and\r\n   heteroskedasticity tests).\r\n\r\n   Coefficients should include standard errors or t statistics, and some\r\n   indication of statistical significance (P values or * for P < .05, **\r\n   for P < .01). A note explains whether there are standard errors or t\r\n   statistics. Report P < .10 only if the sample size is small.  For very\r\n   large datasets it makes sense to demand a higher degree of certainty,\r\n   so only report P < .01.\r\n\r\n   Include a meaningful number of digits, usually at two or three\r\n   significant places. Neither .34849560 (3.132534) nor 0.00 (SE = 0.00,\r\n   P < .001) is useful. Sometimes multiply or divide a variable by 10 so\r\n   the coefficient is in a meaningful range.\r\n\r\n   Always in the text, and often in the tables, translate the\r\n   coefficients of interest into words. For example, convert logit\r\n   coefficients to measure how a one-unit change in the variable affects\r\n   the probability of the occurrence of the event (dP/dX). Translate\r\n   hazard rate coefficients to show how a one unit change in the variable\r\n   affects the expected time until some event occurs: \"If the union local\r\n   is in a city, its expected lifetime was four months shorter than if it\r\n   was rural.\"\r\n\r\n   Also, always explain whether the effect is large or not, perhaps by\r\n   comparing its size to something readers understand. For example, the\r\n   importance of marital status on wages can be expressed as how many\r\n   years of education are required to raise wages by as much. Sometimes\r\n   standardized coefficients (expressed in standard deviation units) are\r\n   useful: \"A one month increase in training (approximately one standard\r\n   deviation) corresponds to 4 percent lower turnover (approximately one\r\n   half of a standard deviation).\"\r\n\r\n   Effect sizes from Lisrel, factor analysis, path analysis, ordered\r\n   logits, etc., are hard to understand. Thus, explain the size as well\r\n   as the statistical significance of the important effects.\r\n\r\n   Statistical significance: Most authors focus on whether coefficients\r\n   are statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent\r\n   level.  Thus, if b[1] is statistically significant from zero at the 5%\r\n   level, but b[2] is not, some authors write as if b[1] is different\r\n   from and more important than b[2].  At a minimum, authors should focus\r\n   on confidence intervals, and explicitly test if b[1] and b[2] differ\r\n   by statistically significant amounts.\r\n\r\n   Summary statistics should be included for the referee, although they\r\n   do not always need to be in the paper. Usually include means, standard\r\n   deviations, units, sources, geographical region covered, and sample\r\n   size. Usually include summary statistics for control variables as well\r\n   as for the main variables of interest. Include the statistics for the\r\n   un-logged version of any important variables you use in log form. If\r\n   your paper computes important and meaningful intermediate results\r\n   (residuals from a first-stage equation, for example), include their\r\n   summary statistics.\r\n\r\n   Often give the referee a table of correlations of either the main\r\n   variables or of all the variables.\r\n\r\n   Use simple statistical procedures to complement fancier analyses. Many\r\n   papers have a simple comparison of means as their main result (to be\r\n   formalized and measured more precisely in later sections). If your\r\n   paper has such a comparison at its core, then present the unadjusted\r\n   means (e.g., men vs. women, or U.S. vs. Japan) before the fancier\r\n   statistical analysis.\r\n\r\n   Figures and graphs, like tables, are supposed to be comprehensible\r\n   without reference to the text, and the text without reference to the\r\n   figure. Place labels (in words, not symbols or variable names) and\r\n   units on axes.\r\n\r\n   Equations worthy of being in your paper can be expressed as a\r\n   sentence. Do so. Many economic theories generate an interesting\r\n   first-order condition. Restate it in words: \"At the optimum, a dollar\r\n   spent today must bring the same utility as a dollar spent tomorrow,\r\n   suitably discounted.\"\r\n\r\n   Abstracts present the question the paper will answer. Since social\r\n   scientists are not mystery writers, abstracts also summarize the\r\n   results.

This section presents a checklist of common\r\n   imperfections in empirical research. Discuss the limitations of your\r\n   paper and plausible alternate explanations for the results.\r\n\r\n   Surveys face problems with the match between the actual sample and the\r\n   perfect sample. Always mention the response rates and possible\r\n   response biases. Are responses likely to be sensitive to changes in\r\n   the wording of the questions? Do respondents have incentives to hide\r\n   their attitudes? Are attitudes likely to match behaviors?\r\n\r\n   A naming issue appears when data undergo factor analysis or are summed\r\n   into an index. Do not merely name the factors or indices, but present\r\n   a sample of the questions along with the factor weights. Differentiate\r\n   exploratory from confirmatory factor analysis.\r\n\r\n   Econometric and statistical analyses are subject to all the\r\n   difficulties of surveys. They also fall prey to the \"textbook\r\n   chapters:\" simultaneity, sample selection, measurement error,\r\n   outliers, and so forth.  Almost all analyses should use methods that\r\n   adjust for clustering of the sample (as in most common datasets) and\r\n   that are robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity.  Re-analyze the\r\n   data several times to check the specification, and make sure that your\r\n   results are not sensitive to changes in the estimating technique,\r\n   functional forms, control variables, and so forth. If all is well,\r\n   allude to these results briefly, but do not include them in the paper.\r\n   Often include copies of these tables for the referee.\r\n\r\n   Experiments almost always have questionable external validity. Is\r\n   there any reason to believe people in actual organizations involved in\r\n   complex social networks making decisions that affect their careers\r\n   over many years act the way the college sophomores do in your one-hour\r\n   treatment?\r\n\r\n   Is the name you have given your treatment appropriate? If you tell one\r\n   group of people they are not worth the wage they receive, this\r\n   treatment may affect self-esteem as well as perceived equity. Thus,\r\n   naming the treated group perceived inequity can mislead readers.\r\n\r\n   Case studies have limited generalizability. Explain in what sense this\r\n   case study generalizes, and outline the limits of its\r\n   generalizability. What are the likely biases due to subjective\r\n   perception and reporting?\r\n\r\n   Causality is almost never clear in the social sciences. Common\r\n   problems include reverse causality, selection effects, and omitted\r\n   variable bias. Discuss alternative causal explanations for the\r\n   results.  These alternative channels often suggest additional tests\r\n   you might perform.\r\n\r\n   When using instrumental variables or multi-equation methods such as\r\n   two-stage least squares and maximum likelihood, always list your\r\n   instruments or other identifying assumptions. Include these lists in\r\n   both the text and the tables. Justify why it is plausible that your\r\n   instruments are exogenous. Both identification by functional form (as\r\n   in many sample selection models) and instrumenting with lagged\r\n   variables require strong justification.\r\n\r\n   Economic theory: Explain the robustness of the results in \"assumption\r\n   space.\" Differentiate assumptions that are crucial from those that\r\n   merely simplify. Even if you do not prove, explain what happens if\r\n   preferences are not Cobb-Douglas, or if agents are not identical.\r\n   Usually include detailed derivations in an appendix for the referee.\r\n\r\nStylistic issues\r\n\r\n   Go for clear exposition of substance as opposed to trying to impress\r\n   readers with big words, hard statistics, or fancy theory. Present the\r\n   main conclusions so that they will be accessible to the nonspecialist\r\n   reader in the final section.\r\n\r\n   Use footnotes sparingly, and Latin almost never. Don't rely on\r\n   variable names if you can spell them out. Remind readers often of the\r\n   meaning of your symbols: often replace \"q\" with \"the elasticity of\r\n   substitution.\" Readers have to expand out the entire phrase--help them\r\n   out.\r\n\r\nFinal words\r\n\r\n   No article has ever suffered from too much helpful advice from\r\n   colleagues. Be sure many readers look at your article. Use family,\r\n   friends, colleagues from other departments: most of your paper should\r\n   be understandable even to the nonspecialist.\r\n   _______________________\r\n\r\n   [1] From the BPP class of 2006."

        "articleBody": "On a wing and a prayer\r\n\r\n   Using amateur actors and a traumatised chicken, City of God exposes\r\n   the violent truth of life in the slums of Brazil. Here, the\r\n   Oscar-winning director Walter Salles explains why it had to be made\r\n   Saturday December 21, 2002\r\n   \r\n   It begins with a chicken who knows too much. We are in City of God, a\r\n   favela (a Rio de Janeiro slum) in the early 1980s. A gang of young\r\n   drug-dealers is preparing feijoada, the local stew. This chicken knows\r\n   that she is dead meat and tries desperately to escape. The tragi-comic\r\n   scene that ensues determines the tone of City of God, a Brazilian film\r\n   by Fernando Meirelles, co-directed by Katia Lund. The fleeing animal\r\n   is chased and fired at by the young hoodlums until fate leads her\r\n   under the wheels of a police car.\r\n\r\n   \r\n   A clash between the young princes of the favela and the police is\r\n   imminent and promises to be bloody. It will, however, be frozen in\r\n   time, as Meirelles takes us to the 1960s and 1970s in the same locale.\r\n   Based on a true account by Paulo Lins, a writer born and raised in the\r\n   place that lends its name to the film, City of God does not offer the\r\n   comforting and touristy image of the Brazilian slums that Marcel\r\n   Camus's 1959 film Orfeu Negro sold to the world. This is about a\r\n   nation within a nation, about the millions of olvidados (the\r\n   forgotten) that are statistically relevant, but scarcely represented\r\n   on screen.\r\n\r\n   Rarely has a film created such heated debate in Brazil. The country's\r\n   current leader, Luiz Inacio da Silva, at the time the socialist\r\n   presidential candidate, urged the then president, Fernando Henrique\r\n   Cardoso, to see City of God in order to understand the extent of the\r\n   urban tragedy in Brazil. Cardoso did. Arnaldo Jabor, one of Brazil's\r\n   most important intellectuals, wrote that \"this is not only a film. It\r\n   is an important fact, a crucial statement, a hole in our national\r\n   conscience.\"\r\n\r\n   After I directed the Oscar-winning Central Station, our small\r\n   production house had the opportunity to help a few films by upcoming\r\n   Brazilian directors. The decision to be part of City of God was\r\n   defined by the trust we had in Meirelles and his co-director, but also\r\n   because few films could shed more light on the social apartheid of\r\n   Brazil.\r\n\r\n   There are more than 40,000 violent deaths a year in Brazil, more than\r\n   three times the total number of deaths in Kosovo. Many of these deaths\r\n   in our urban areas are the result of confrontation between drug gangs,\r\n   or between dealers and the police. What City of God achieves is the\r\n   possibility to understand how we got to this chaos.\r\n\r\n   In the 1960s, families of immigrants expelled from their land in the\r\n   north-east of the country found an illusory refuge in the slums of the\r\n   capital, Rio de Janeiro. The marginalised youth living on the fringe\r\n   of society at that time had to bend to strict familial codes and\r\n   rules. The drug was marijuana, which inspired a contemplative,\r\n   \"romantic\" lifestyle. Gun use at the time was sporadic and the ends\r\n   justified the means.\r\n\r\n   In the 1970s and 1980s everything changed. The first large\r\n   drug-dealers appeared and outlaws ceased to lead a nomadic life and\r\n   settled their businesses in the heart of the favelas. These dealers\r\n   began to control the communities in which they operated and created a\r\n   parallel system of justice within their borders. Cocaine became the\r\n   drug of choice and the .38 was traded for the AK47 and other machine\r\n   guns. The death toll grew dramatically and the dealers became younger\r\n   and younger. It was hell.\r\n\r\n   City of God follows several real characters, whose lives started and\r\n   ended within the favela's perimeter during these three decades. Bene,\r\n   the cool marijuana dealer, Ze Pequeo, a merciless killer, and Rocket,\r\n   the innocent eye, Lins's alter ego, a young black kid who manages to\r\n   break the country's social and race barriers - at a price.\r\n\r\n   Most of the film's actors are kids from amateur theatre groups in\r\n   favelas, or non-actors found in a year-long casting effort in these\r\n   communities. The directors rehearsed them for more than six months\r\n   before the shoot and improvisation was encouraged. Like other\r\n   directors in Brazil, I am used to working with non-actors, but I still\r\n   do not know how Meirelles and Lund managed to achieve such a sense of\r\n   realism.\r\n\r\n   Do not expect pity or redemption. There are no such things in City of\r\n   God. This is the depiction of a world where people have been forgotten\r\n   for too long by the Brazilian ruling classes; a world where the state\r\n   does not provide proper health or education services. In fact, the\r\n   only items it provides freely are bullets.\r\n\r\n   Now for the present: a time when the olvidados got tired of being\r\n   forgotten, a time of diffuse, uncontrollable violence. \" City of God\r\n   is not only a portrait of our favelas, it is also our portrait, at 24\r\n   frames a second, our faces blurred with the faces of 10-year-old\r\n   children holding machine guns. All the manifestations of our chaos\r\n   become visible. This film will be seen by the whole country in terror,\r\n   and I believe it will cause transformations in the political arena,\"\r\n   says Jabor.\r\n\r\n   There were also dissonant voices in Brazil, arguing that the film\r\n   gives the impression that favelas are populated only by drug-dealers.\r\n   They are not. In fact, an immense part of the Brazilian population has\r\n   been the victim of this present state. This is when we realise that\r\n   the chicken caught in the cross-fire at the beginning of City of God\r\n   is not only a chicken. It is the reflection of so many Brazilians\r\n   trapped in an unjust country.\r\n\r\n    City of God is released on January 3.\r\n\r\n   The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and\r\n   Clarifications column, Tuesday January 14 2003\r\n\r\n   An editing error introduced the claim that the director's earlier\r\n   film, Central Station, was an Oscar winner. It was nominated for best\r\n   foreign film in 1999, but it did not win the Academy Award."

        "articleBody": "     Population Growth\n\n   One of the real signs of the tremendous success of the Qing dynasty in\n   the eighteenth century in what historians like to call the High Qing\n   (1680 to about 1830 or so) was the enormous increase in population.\n   Looking back from the year 2004, we tend to think of population growth\n   as not such a great thing, but at the time, it was really looked on as\n   a sign that the regime was doing its job. It enabled more people to\n   come into the world, to have the satisfactions of being alive, and to\n   live something vaguely approximating the Confucian good life.\n   The Qing were able to preside over a rough tripling of the Chinese\n   population between about 1680 and maybe 1820. This growth was achieved\n   without a decrease in the standard of living, thanks to the increasing\n   sophistication of the economy, to state efforts to shore up regions\n   that couldn't produce enough food for themselves, or through such\n   areas being able to produce some other commodity that they could trade\n   for food.\n   Also the population grew because of various technological changes,\n   mostly in agriculture. The Qing were very good at taxing relatively\n   lightly in this period while providing order and making sure that very\n   basic survival services--such as flood control-- were provided,\n   whether by the government or by private parties encouraged by the\n   government.\n    \n   Population Growth Creates Ecological Changes\n   This population growth, in some cases, eventually became a problem. In\n   the eighteenth century, however, it was still overwhelmingly seen as a\n   blessing. It happened very differently in different parts of the\n   country. The Yangzi delta, the richest part of the country, had almost\n   zero population growth between about 1770 and 1850 for a number of\n   reasons, including the conscious use of various methods of birth\n   control\n   \n\n     The Myth of the Big Chinese Family\n\n   One of the great myths about China is that of the Chinese family that\n   so desperately wants a son that they have as many kids as possible and\n   end up having enormous families. Although Chinese families did very\n   much want sons, they were also perfectly conscious of the fact that\n   their ability to support children was limited and that, in the long\n   run, they didn't improve their odds by simply having the maximum\n   number of births. And, in fact, births per woman in late imperial\n   China are actually, on average, probably somewhat lower than in early\n   modern Europe.\n   There are various theories as to what kinds of birth control were\n   practiced during this time. This is actually quite controversial and\n   hard to reconstruct, but we do know that one way or another, they\n   seemed to keep births down. This is very different from the\n   traditional image of China as this land of Malthusian horror where,\n   because they couldn't restrain their population, it was only kept in\n   check by floods and famines.\n   That's not the story at all. And it's again a good example of how we\n   find the things we're trained to find. Western-trained demographers\n   understood that in Europe, population control worked as people delayed\n   marriage in hard times. They assumed that this was the main mechanism\n   for fertility control available to premodern societies, so it didn't\n   even occur to them when they looked at societies like China to think\n   about the possibility that there might be effective birth control\n   within marriage. Therefore, when they looked at China, they saw that\n   access to marriage wasn't economically regulated the way it was in\n   Europe--the average age at marriage doesn't seem to get older at hard\n   times, women marry young anyway--and they said, \"Aha, society with no\n   control on fertility. Therefore, if fertility is unchecked, they must\n   have had all these enormous problems of overpopulation.\"\n   It turns out the Chinese found ways to control fertility within\n   marriage, which many scholars thought simply did not happen before\n   modern chemical and mechanical contraception. Population growth was\n   concentrated not in the advanced regions of the coast, which were\n   running out of land and realized it, but out on the frontier."

        "articleBody": "Sunshine State\r\n   dir. John Sayles\r\n   \r\n\r\n   The torching of a tacky float during \"Buccaneer Days\" opens John\r\n   Sayles' Sunshine State. Pirates of all types abound in fictional\r\n   Plantation Island, Fla., a small town suffering its conversion from a\r\n   place of character and history into one of those upscale, pastel\r\n   resorts you speed past on I-95. The ensemble cast is split by the\r\n   dividing line of the movie's primary concern: To sell out or not sell\r\n   out? As it's Florida, there's plenty of sun, sea and palms, golfers in\r\n   white slacks, weary locals in denims; and, as it's John Sayles\r\n   territory, our sympathies are meant to fall wholly on the side of the\r\n   grassroots townies.\r\n\r\n   The heart of the film is split between two daughters. Marly Temple\r\n   (Edie Falco) is the proprietor of a small motel; after getting dumped\r\n   by her golf-pro boyfriend, she couples up with a nicer example of one\r\n   of the enemy, landscape architect Jack Meadows (Timothy Hutton). Marly\r\n   longs to sell the motel her father (a grizzled, speechifying Ralph\r\n   Waite) has pushed on her as his personal dream to maintain. A former\r\n   \"Weeki Wachee Mermaid,\" Marly exudes a knowing world-weariness, the\r\n   threat of the encroaching developers awakening in her a desire for\r\n   flight. By contrast, Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) returns to\r\n   next-town-over Lincoln Beach (based on the actual African-American\r\n   community of American Beach, Fla., founded in 1935) to wrestle with a\r\n   difficult mother and finds herself staying to fight for the home from\r\n   which she was exiled years before. As in Sayles' Passion Fish, two\r\n   women, one immobilized and white, the other itinerant and black, share\r\n   the emotional center of the film. The social ecosystem around these\r\n   women gradually reveals itself as a net that grips, either as a trap\r\n   or as necessary support.\r\n\r\n   In weaving his morality play, Sayles has chosen sides and doles out\r\n   the vice and virtue in a straightforward, if simplistic, manner. Those\r\n   on the side of maintaining the old community have all the dignity,\r\n   pathos and deeply felt issues to be played out; those who favor\r\n   gentrification have all the neuroses -- they are suicidal gambling\r\n   addicts, bitter former beauty queens, wounded semi-pro athletes turned\r\n   car salesmen, heartless local politicos, clownish fat golfers, trailer\r\n   park Civil War reenactors.\r\n\r\n   The decks are stacked against these folks, at times mere foils to\r\n   Sayles' soapboxing. Francine Pickney (Mary Steenburgen) is the town's\r\n   Chamber of Commerce queen bee, an archetype dusted off from nearly\r\n   every Robert Altman film, married to troubled banker Earl Pickney\r\n   (Gordon Clapp, the wimpy cop from \"NYPD Blue\"). Flash Philips (Tom\r\n   Wright) is the ex-linebacker (he skipped out long ago after getting a\r\n   teenage Angela Bassett pregnant) hired as front man for a car\r\n   dealership, itself the front for some nameless, faceless corporate\r\n   entity buying up all the homes in Lincoln Beach. Miguel Ferrer has a\r\n   too-brief gem of a scene planning his hard-sell strategy like a\r\n   wartime general. Alan King and Clifton James are two stogie-chomping\r\n   golfers who eventually run out of green, playing ironic Greek chorus\r\n   to the proceedings (\"Nature! Who needs it?\") These are folks, Sayles\r\n   tells us with the subtlety of tractors plowing through an ancient\r\n   Indian graveyard, neither to be pitied nor trusted; they are, in the\r\n   end, comic relief.\r\n\r\n   In a similar dramatic cul de sac, Sayles shows the same love of loose\r\n   ends he practiced in Limbo, by dealing us a big wooden red herring of\r\n   a plot point. Acting teacher Delia Temple, played by former NEA\r\n   chairwoman Jane Alexander, hires a pyromaniac teen to build her a\r\n   coffin for her upcoming solo performance of Faulkner's \"As I Lay\r\n   Dying.\" Beyond two minor scenes involving the construction and\r\n   delivery of the coffin, nothing else ever comes of this\r\n   (ever-unoccupied) box. This all seems to be Sayles at his most\r\n   didactic: Is he in mourning for the NEA, paved over by the new\r\n   anti-art morality?\r\n\r\n   The film's strength is quieter than Sayles' politics, which, despite\r\n   his broad strokes, displays genuine, adult interest in the demarcation\r\n   of character (refreshing in this summer of animated sci-fi\r\n   spectacles). People decide to sell out, love, forgive or remain\r\n   entrenched in their need to believe in the American dream; and their\r\n   paths shift, slightly yet deeply. Even the climax is a minor, if\r\n   momentous, affair: What halts the progress (or destruction) is not the\r\n   human endeavor on either side of the battle, but the ghosts of the\r\n   past. The dead demand attention, and rising from their graves\r\n   (literally), they stop the major conflict of Sunshine State in its\r\n   tracks.\r\n\r\n   The powerbrokers, the moneymen, the sharks in on the money trail, all\r\n   leave town when the tractors halt. Men leave, Sayles seems to say;\r\n   they are either walking out on women or paving over things. What's\r\n   left in the vacuum is the film's true concern: the women who have to\r\n   clean things up. Sayles may be his own best example of a male involved\r\n   in his own drama while a quieter, more human story resolves itself on\r\n   the sidelines. This character-driven quality has always been in\r\n   Sayles' films, and bringing together such distinct concerns as\r\n   presenting broad social canvas, as in Matewan, and telling the\r\n   African-American's story undiluted, as in The Brother From Another\r\n   Planet, makes Sunshine State his most comprehensive film to date. And\r\n   he does it quietly: The prodigal daughter who has returned is able to\r\n   stay, and the one who had been stuck at home has, like all true\r\n   mermaids, returned to the sea.\r\n\r\n   -- Stephen Bracco"

        "articleBody": "Northern Ireland Conflict-Religion vs Politics\n\n   The conflict in Northern Ireland is likely one of the most closely\n   watched andhotly debated disputes of our time. Spanning now for over a\n   century, whatremains at the root of the conflict is unclear. Many\n   theories have developedover time, yet no one theory seems to\n   adequately describe the complex struggle. The conflict has been\n   divided down many lines; ethnically between the Britishand the Irish,\n   geographically, between the North and the South of Ireland,\n   andreligiously between Protestants and Catholics. Theories that have\n   emerged havepointed to causes such as land claims and a nationalist\n   ideology, ethnicity andculture, and perhaps most frequently, religion\n   when attempting to define theconflict. In fact, what is more likely is\n   that elements of all of these issueslie at the root of what is\n   commonly referred to as \"The Troubles\".The history of this\n   contemporary conflict is detailed, but impossible to ignore.While\n   different factions of the dispute would argue that the problem\n   begancenturies ago, I will examine briefly the history of the\n   \"troubles\" from the endof the 19th century forward. For much of its\n   history, Ireland has lived underBritish rule. As the 19th century drew\n   to a close, Britain became aware of arapidly growing sense of Irish\n   Nationalism. In 1870, the Irish Protestantsplaced the notion of Home\n   Rule on the front burner in an attempt to separateIreland from the\n   rapid secularism that was occurring in Britain. Very quicklythe\n   movement was picked up by Irish Catholics who saw Home Rule as a\n   trulynationalist ideal, and by 1874 they had dominated the movement.\n   This pushed theProtestants back towards Unionism and was one of the\n   many strikes against theidea of a united Ireland.\n\n   Feeling tremendous pressure to grant Ireland Home Rule, Britain began\n   to talkabout making efforts to \"pacify\" Ireland, implying that it\n   would indeed granttheir wish. Talks of Home Rule were then delayed.\n   The Irish saw the delay as afurther political tactic of a British\n   parliament who had no intention ofgranting them autonomy. The British\n   struggled with the question of who wouldrun this complex society that\n   was so heavily rooted in imperialistic tradition,and who at best had a\n   shaky industrial and political structure. This delayfurther divided\n   Irish nationalists. New radical forms of nationalism emerged,such as\n   the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn Fein, whose leaders\n   werewilling to use violent means if necessary to secure Irish\n   independence.A further divide between Protestants and Catholics also\n   developed at this time,particularly in the northern province of\n   Ulster. Unionists groups, who wereProtestant by religion and British\n   by tradition, were opposed to Home Rulebecause they believed that\n   Ireland should maintain her ties to Britain. In aneffort to resist the\n   Home Rule movement, they began to organize. They created aProvisional\n   Government of Ulster, complete with a constitution and raised anarmy\n   to defend it. Further to that, in 1912 they created what was called\n   the`Solemn League and Covenant' which bound their followers to use any\n   meansnecessary to resist Home Rule. They gathered over a half a\n   million signatures,some of the Unionists even signing in their own\n   blood.\n\n   The debate over Home Rule was put on hold when World War I broke out.\n   TheDublin Easter Rising of 1916 served as a reminder to the British\n   that thequestion of Ireland's independence would need to be answered\n   when the war wasover. Over 220 people were killed and over 600 more\n   injured when IrishRepublican Brotherhood rebels took hold of Dublin.\n   The British, outnumberingthe rebels 20 to 1, eventually took back the\n   city six days later. In the faceof what could have been a political\n   victory for the British, they made the errorof executing the surviving\n   Irish rebels, martyring them and instilling anger anddetermination in\n   the minds of many Irish Nationalists.\n\n   The dilemma of Home Rule as the British saw it was how to given the\n   IrishCatholics what they wanted while still providing for the Irish\n   Protestants ofUlster. Their answer was the Government of Ireland Act\n   of 1920, which createdtwo separate parliaments, one in the North and\n   one in the South. Theseparliaments were charged with their own\n   domestic affairs, but all foreignaffairs and income tax collection\n   remained in the hands of the British.Further resistance and guerilla\n   warfare eventually led to the Anglo-Irish Treatyof 1921, which\n   outlined the creation of the Irish Free State, now known as\n   theRepublic of Ireland. It was made up of the provinces of Munster,\n   Leinster andConnaught, as well as three of the nine counties of Ulster\n   - Donegal, Monaghan,and Cavan. Northern Ireland, now a legal entity\n   made of up the six remainingcounties of Ulster - Fermanagh, Armagh,\n   Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and Down -remained under British rule. The\n   division created an almost entirely Catholicpopulation in the South of\n   Ireland and a substantial Protestant majority in theNorth.\n\n   The partitioning of Ireland was viewed by the South as a temporarily\n   solution tothe `Protestant' problem in the North. They maintained that\n   not an inch ofIrish land would be given up to the British. In 1937,\n   the creation of the IrishConstitution in the South laid claim to the\n   six counties that remained underBritish rule and acknowledged that\n   they were being held temporarily andillegally.\n\n   Population divisions had always existed in the two major cities of\n   what was nowNorthern Ireland. Belfast, the largest city and center of\n   economic activity hada largely Protestant population, where as Derry,\n   a key center for the shippingindustry had a largely Catholic\n   population. Both cities also boasted aconcentrated minority group, yet\n   conflict was not always inherent, as theminority did not pose a threat\n   to the majority's way of life. With the rise ofindustrialization,\n   there was a rapid migration of people to Belfast,predominantly in\n   search of work and housing. The majority of the peoplemigrating were\n   Catholic, which began to present a problem for the\n   Protestantcommunity. Not only were they competing for housing and\n   employment, but thepercentage of Catholics in Belfast was not only\n   rising, but they were beginningto organize. As they learned how to use\n   political institutions to wieldinfluence, the Protestants became more\n   resentful of their presence. To theCatholics, their eventual control\n   over Belfast was inevitable. As BernardHughes, the only Roman Catholic\n   representative on the Belfast City Council in1857 stated, \"This town\n   (Belfast) is governed by Protestants, but the bone andsinew of the\n   town is Roman Catholic.\"(Brewer & Higgins 1998). What was born wasa\n   conflict between the working class members of society, while the\n   middle andupper classes struggled to maintain peaceful control. The\n   peace was not tolast.\n\n   The decades to follow would be wrought with violence. Battles would be\n   wagedbetween the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Ulster Defense\n   Association andBritish paramilitaries. Thousands of innocent people\n   would be killed in bombblasts, riots and sectarian killings. Even law\n   abiding citizens lend support tothese groups, because the battle for\n   the \"Cause\" on either side is paramount. What is it that turns these\n   common citizens into killing machines? Whatprevents any kind of peace\n   agreements from taking hold in this conflict riddennation? The answer\n   is perhaps more complicated than the conflict.Theorists have struggled\n   over a solution to \"the Troubles\" in Northern Irelandfor a number of\n   years. Yet in seeking this solution, few have truly gotteninside the\n   conflict. Northern Ireland's battle has produced not only anenormous\n   human cost but also a unique population that has been raised\n   inviolence. Understanding that population is key to any sort of peace\n   agreement. That understanding lies in examining what motivates both\n   sides of the conflict.The battle over land is one of the most common\n   sources of conflict in history. It is not surprising then that it\n   plays a role in this conflict. To the Irish,their identity was rooted\n   in the Church and the Land. British imperialism sawthe implementation\n   of land lordship in Ireland. Protestant landlords rentedland to\n   Catholic tenants, turning an economic system into one wrought with\n   deepreligious animosity. This represented not only conquest but\n   religiouspersecution to the Irish. (Hickey 1984)The Famine of\n   1845-1849 was a significant set back in Anglo-Irish relations.\n   Itrepresented a failure of the British government to provide for the\n   basic needsof the Irish. It was also seen by some as an attempt to\n   pacify the Irishthrough starvation. The relief offered to Catholics\n   during the famine alsofurthered the divide between Protestants and\n   Catholics, as it was often offeredon the condition that they attend a\n   Protestant church. It was becoming clearto Irish Catholics that the\n   root of their hardship lay with the British andIrish nationalism\n   gained momentum.\n\n   Another one of the theories that have been presented is that the\n   conflict isrooted in ethnic or cultural difference. The obvious\n   critique to this idea isthat the Protestant and the Catholic groups\n   have one major thing in common -they are all Irish. Yet, these two\n   groups would tend to differ in that belief.The label Protestant has\n   come to signify the Irish of the North that identifythemselves with\n   British tradition. They pledge allegiance to the British Crownand\n   fight to maintain ties to Britain. Despite the fact that they were\n   likelyborn in Ireland, they tend to associate themselves with being\n   British. They arealso referred to as Unionists, Loyalists or\n   Orangemen. On the flip side of thatare the Catholics. The population\n   that falls under this label is consideredethnically Irish. They fight\n   for a united Ireland, free from British rule. They attempt to maintain\n   the Irish language of Gaelic, and although there arefew places left\n   that use it pre-dominantly, it is still taught in Roman\n   Catholicschools. These people are often referred to as Nationalists or\n   Republicans.The Irish argument then is that there is a distinctly\n   `Irish' culture that isbeing stifled by a `British' majority in\n   Northern Ireland. The two keyselements of the `Irish' culture that\n   make co-existence near impossible are thatit is rooted in a\n   nationalist ideology and that Catholic beliefs are intertwinedwith\n   that ideology. Their belief is that harmony can only exist when all\n   ofIreland is united and the assimilation of the non-Irish is\n   complete.The major problem with this plan is two-fold. Firstly,\n   Protestants have aculture which they believe in and defend and do not\n   wish to sacrifice. Secondly, Northern Ireland has existed as an\n   independent state for over 80years, and has likely developed a kind of\n   culture that is unique and that maynot blend well with the culture of\n   the Republic of Ireland.\n\n   Religion seems to be the element that ties many of the theories on the\n   conflicttogether. Under the above pretense, the labels Catholic and\n   Protestant are usedto convey cultural and political connotations. Yet\n   religion remains an integralpart of ones culture. In the battle over\n   land, religion maintains its tiethrough the battle between Protestant\n   landlords and Catholic tenants. Religioneven has political links, as\n   many nationalists, such as D.P. Morgan, the founderof the Leader\n   newspaper, believe that the two ideas are inseparable:\n\n   \"When we look out on Ireland we see that those who\n   believe, or may be immediately induced to believe, in\n   Ireland as a nation are, as a matter of fact, Catholics...\n   If a non-Catholic nationalist Irishman does not wish to\n   live in a Catholic atmosphere let him turn Orangeman.\" (Hickey 1984)\n\n   It is important then to look seriously at the role that religion plays\n   in theconflict in Northern Ireland.\n\n   There are two sides to the religion debate. One the one hand, some\n   believe thatthe labels Protestant and Catholic are just that - labels\n   used to define twowarring factions of the conflict in the absence of a\n   real ethnic divide. Giventhat one can point to ideas of territorial\n   dispute, nationalism and culture aspotential sources of conflict, it\n   is easy to see where this opinion is formed.Yet when examined more\n   closely, there is merit in the argument that there aredogmatic\n   differences in the two religions which keep the conflict at\n   astalemate. While both Protestantism and Catholicism are forms of\n   Christianity,the beliefs surrounding how society should be structured\n   can lead to politicalconflict.\n\n   Catholicism is a very closely knit religion. One of the key elements\n   of thebelief is in the emphasis placed on prayer and sacraments. The\n   individual whoadministers these sacraments becomes of the utmost\n   importance, which results inthe creation of the priesthood. This\n   suggests a social order where the leadershave significant control over\n   the systems of a society.\n\n   Protestantism in contrast is based much more loosely. It is composed\n   of severalforms of Christianity, including Anglican, Presbyterian,\n   Methodist, Baptist andthe Church of Ireland. The appeal is much more\n   direct - one where the ministerprepares parishioners to meet God\n   directly. This poses a direct threat to thestructured organization of\n   the Roman Catholic faith. Likewise, Protestants fearthat if Ireland is\n   united, their faith will be consumed by Catholicism.Ultimately, the\n   result is that the religious divide between these two groups isnot\n   merely in symbolic membership, but also in the interpretation of\n   theChristian faith. As indicated by Professor John Hickey, \"it is more\n   a questionof religion inspiring politics than of politics making use\n   of religion.\" (Hickey1984) Religion is often downplayed as a cause of\n   the conflict in NorthernIreland because Western pluralistic societies\n   do not place as much emphasis onthe importance of religion in daily\n   life.\n\n   The question then becomes how does one find a solution to a conflict\n   thatis so multifaceted? Belfast child psychologist Morris Frazer\n   indicatesthat what Northern Ireland is now faced with is \"a generation\n   of childrenwho have lived with fear, have been taught to hate and who\n   now aspire tokill.\" (Morrissey and Smyth 2002). Here in lies the\n   starting point toresolution - education. It has become clear that in\n   order to implementa peace agreement between Protestants and Catholics,\n   and to make positiveprogress towards a bi-national state, a bottom-up\n   approach must be used.\n\n   There are a few key things that must be taken into consideration by\n   all sides. The first is that violence is not now, nor will it ever be,\n   a successfulbargaining tool. Further to that is the idea that a peace\n   agreement cannot endat the absence of direct violence. Progress must\n   be made towards a model ofpositive peace. In order to achieve this,\n   negotiations must consider thepositions of the minority - Catholics in\n   Northern Ireland and Protestants inIreland as a whole. No one groups'\n   rights can be infringed upon. This wouldlead almost naturally to the\n   idea of a bi-national state. Coexistence is thebest chance that\n   Ireland has at unification. It is the only real way to obtainpositive\n   peace and a stable infrastructure.\n\n   Peace Process\n\n   Bombings, shootings and countless other acts. Will the violence ever\n   end?Will peace and stability ever come? These were the questions\n   thatfor most of Northern Irelands history best described prospects for\n   asolution. For generations unionist and nationalist communities had\n   beenseparated as well as isolated from each other, turning to\n   demonstrationsof community strength to meeting with each other in\n   negotiation andcooperation. For the most part, the earliest attempts\n   at peace attemptedto make only mechanical political solutions. These\n   only reinforcedthe already opposing relationships. Relative calm\n   followed the IrelandAct of 1949, which created the Republic of Ireland\n   in the south. By the1950s, even Catholics in the North, still securely\n   tethered to Britain,seemed ready to accept equality rather than\n   pushing for securing a moreunited Ireland, scholars note. But that\n   changed after Northern Ireland'sCatholics organized a large\n   demonstration protesting discriminationin voting rights, housing and\n   unemployment in 1968. A police crackdownfollowed, sparking months of\n   violence and a reemergence of the Republicanmovement. The subsequent\n   bloody riots between Protestants and Catholicsmarked the beginning of\n   The Troubles, the euphemism for the period ofviolence that would\n   continue for years in Northern Ireland.\n\n   Both the Irish Republican and British sides experienced breakthroughs\n   in the1980s that would help to prepare the ground for the peace\n   process. Thepropaganda campaign around the hunger strikes started the\n   Sinn Fein involvementin electoral politics and community action. It\n   was this event that started atransformation. This was the beginning of\n   Sinn Fein's ascendancy over the IRA. This was the beginning of a shift\n   in emphasis from a military strategy to aprimarily political one, and\n   a lowering margin of victory on which theRepublican outlook was\n   focused, from the absolute principle of the right of theIrish people\n   as a whole to self-determination towards ensuring that theimmediate\n   interests of their core base of support were sufficiently\n   representedin and by British state institutions. This move into party\n   politics would endup leading Sinn Fein to end their commitment to not\n   take their seats in theDail, a commitment which had been a key\n   principle for Republicans since as farback as the 1920s. In taking\n   their seats in the Irish Parliament and later inlocal councils in\n   Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein was explicitly recognizinginstitutions set\n   up under partition and thus implicitly recognizing thepartition of the\n   country itself.\n\n   When Republicans did engage in a peace process contacts like\n   nationalist JohnHume were to be important. With the additional support\n   from sections ofIrish-America this cooperation with 'constitutional'\n   nationalism became thepan-nationalist alliance. This connection acted\n   as the go through whichRepublicans were able to ease their movement\n   from a confrontational approach toa placatory one. The role of\n   intermediaries was to become very important in thepeace process.\n   During the late 1980s contacts were made and a network ofconnections\n   developed. But at this stage the contacts were largely secret\n   andunfruitful, a reflection of both the pariah status of Republicans\n   and thedistance between their stance and that of other political\n   actorsIt was not until these existing relationships were challenged,\n   most crucially inthe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and subsequently in\n   several other initiativesjointly determined by the British and Irish\n   governments, that the main partiesbegan to participate in efforts to\n   create a democratic peace. The search forpeace had always been\n   overwhelmed by the violence that reinforced separation. The British\n   government's negotiation and signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreementwith\n   the government of the Republic of Ireland in 1985 marked some\n   developmentsthat were to be important for the peace process. The\n   Agreement brought theBritish government closer with the government of\n   the Republic of Ireland. Thiswas also significant for moving away from\n   viewing Northern Ireland as a purelydomestic matter for the British\n   government. The introduction and maintenance ofthe Agreement was\n   achieved against the express wishes of Ulster unionists. Thiswas an\n   indication of the declining power of the Unionists in Northern\n   Ireland. Unlike the Power-sharing Assembly of 1974, Unionists failed\n   in their attempts towreck the Agreement. Such a failure also indicated\n   that the British governmentwas prepared to face down Unionist\n   opposition.\n\n   The current peace process began in April 1993 when John Hume, leader\n   of theSDLP, and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, met to discuss the\n   future ofNorthern Ireland. An idea of determination for the people of\n   Ireland was amajor priority. And they hoped these discussions would\n   lead to a historicalagreement between the British and Irish\n   governments. A key element of thisdiscussion was that Britain should\n   be willing to allow the people of Ireland todecide their own political\n   future. This meant that they had to accept thepossibility of a united\n   Ireland. Furthermore, they were to call on Britain todeclare it had no\n   selfish, political, strategic, or economic interest inNorthern\n   Ireland.\n\n   SF in past years had shown some signs that they wished to peacefully\n   anddemocratically reach a political settlement in Northern Ireland.\n   Through theircoming together, Hume and Adams signaled a change in the\n   Nationalists approachto the Northern Irish situation which would,\n   eventually, entail Republicansbeing willing to abandon violence. In\n   this approach, Nationalist leaders hopedto appeal to a much larger\n   percentage of the nationalist community and to theIrish people of the\n   Republic. Violence had reduced support for the Nationalistcause in the\n   Republic of Ireland. The task of SF would be to convince the IRAthat\n   they could achieve their political aims without the use of\n   paramilitaryforce.\n\n   The discussions between Hume and Adams would be the driving factor to\n   talksbetween the British and Irish governments. In June 1993 both\n   governments cametogether to discuss the future of each governments\n   relationship to NorthernIreland. For six months, both governments\n   would try to reach a compromise. Themain debate focused on the\n   question of self-determination. In the end theBritish government could\n   not accept self-determination for the people of Irelandas a whole. On\n   15 December 1993 the Joint Declaration on Peace was released. To\n   Republicans, the declaration was not seen as a solution to the\n   conflictbetween the two communities. The document claimed to create a\n   structure inwhich a peaceful political settlement could come about.\n\n   Both British and Irish governments knew that no democratic process\n   could beinfluenced by violence. It was also known that if the talks\n   were to produce anylasting settlement the process would have to be as\n   inclusive as possible. Theabsence of political parties that\n   represented the various paramilitary groupswas seen as a drawback to\n   the possibility of a permanent settlement. Therefore,it was considered\n   essential that Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groupsshould be\n   encouraged to enter into cease-fires.\n\n   While politicians had struck a compromise, paramilitary groups had\n   not.Republicans spent some time seeking clarification on the Joint\n   Agreement. Onlywhen they felt the agreement would allow them to pursue\n   their objectivespolitically would they consider a cease-fire. Loyalist\n   violence was a responseto Republican violence, but it was also a sign\n   of their insecurity regardingtheir relationship with the British\n   government. Although unionists were in themajority in Northern Ireland\n   and the document would only allow a united Irelandto be achieved by\n   majority consent from the Northern Ireland population,unionists no\n   longer felt they help the power.\n\n   The SF put a lot of effort into the process that eventually was to\n   bring aboutan IRA cease-fire. SF was convinced that the IRA's\n   objectives could be achievedbetter through democratic means. The SF\n   argument clearly influenced the leadersof the IRA. On 31 August 1994\n   the IRA announced their cease-fire. Though it wasa victory for peace,\n   it was not an all-inclusive Republican cease-fire. Therewere other\n   less known groups such as the Irish National Liberation Army\n   andRepublican Sinn Fein that did not consider themselves bound by the\n   IRA'scease-fire. A long and violent six weeks had past before the CLMC\n   announced acease-fire of their own.\n\n   In 1995 both governments introduced a new Framework for Agreement.\n   Peace inNorthern Ireland helped the British and Irish governments find\n   a new confidencein their dialogue. Not only was the document a\n   continuation of issues discussedin The Joint Declaration for Peace, it\n   also introduced new ideas for futuregovernmental structures. Not\n   everybody in the nationalist community rejectedthe framework. Some\n   believed the agreement would be beneficial for the commongood, the\n   proposed structures had the potential to benefit both\n   communitieseconomically. However, the unionists did not see it in the\n   same way. They feltthreatened and betrayed by the document,\n   particularly by the proposedNorth/South structures. In their opinion,\n   a North/South institution with anykind of political power was a sure\n   sign of a step towards Irish unity.The decommissioning of paramilitary\n   arms became an important issue as NorthernIreland moved towards\n   multi-party talks. It became apparent that some of theparticipants\n   would only accept those parties, who were linked to\n   paramilitaryorganizations, into a talk's process if weapons were first\n   handed over. Opposing parties saw this not only as unrealistic but\n   also as an unfairprecondition on the entry to talks. Despite the\n   Mitchell report, the Britishdecided a separate committee should be\n   formed on the question of decommissions. This didn't go over well with\n   Sinn Fein or the IRA. On February 9th, the IRAended their cease-fire.\n   The process was to go on.\n\n   Talks opened June 1996. The UDP and PUP were allowed to remain in\n   talks becausethe CLMC Cease-fire had held under difficult\n   circumstances. As expected, SF wasnot allowed to enter the talks\n   because the IRA had not resumed its cease-firebefore the talks began.\n   It would stay without Sinn Fein and be overshadowed byIRA violence\n   most of the time. As September 1997 grew closer, and SF recognizedthe\n   British government's desire to include them in the talks or else\n   proceedwithout them, the Republican movement reassessed its political\n   situation. JohnHume argued that a resumption of the cease-fire was\n   once again within reach ofthe government. On July 18th Hume and Adams\n   released a joint statement thatsaid lasting commitment would only be\n   achieved if it is based on principles ofdemocracy and equality and has\n   the allegiance of both traditions. Two dayslater, the IRA resumed its\n   cease-fire. Both governments reacted with reservedhope and waited to\n   see if the cease-fire was genuine. If it were clear the IRAhad\n   abandoned all paramilitary activity for six weeks, then SF would be\n   allowedto enter the talks in September. The cease-fire held, SF was\n   admitted into thetalks, and not surprisingly, their arrival marked the\n   departure of the DUP andUKUP. After a sincere effort by both\n   governments to make the multi-party talksall inclusive, the talks\n   still lacked representation from all parties.Violence had a direct\n   impact on multi-party talks as the early months of 1998brought the\n   suspension of two parties from the process. The UDP and SF, afterboth\n   governments concluded that they had breached the Mitchell principles.\n   TheUDP is considered as the political wing of the paramilitary group\n   the UDA / UFFwhich had been linked to many killings. It was made clear\n   that they would beallowed back into the talks after a period of time\n   if they remained committed tothe Mitchell principles. In late February\n   1998, SF was also suspended from thetalks. Both governments believed\n   those two killings, that of a Loyalistparamilitary and a Catholic drug\n   dealer, was the work of the IRA. As the talkswere nearing the May 1998\n   deadline, the two governments set an exclusion of twoweeks provided\n   there were no further breaches of the Mitchell principles. Alittle\n   less than a month after the UDP walked out of the talks, they\n   rejoinedthem on 23 February 1998. Despite Unionist claims that the IRA\n   was linked torecent bombings, SF also were allowed back in the talks\n   on 23 March 1998.In an effort to overcome the political gridlock, the\n   independent chairman of themulti-party talks set a deadline for\n   agreement as the 9 April 1998. Thedeadline did give the process a new\n   sense of urgency and had been a good idea. During the last week of\n   March and the first week of April serious problems stilllay in the\n   path of a political. Not surprisingly, Unionists and Nationalistswere\n   divided over how power would be shared in the proposed Northern\n   IrelandAssembly, and the extent to which the Irish government would\n   have influence overNorthern Ireland under the proposed North-South\n   structures.\n\n   In retrospect, the tensions that were apparent between the various\n   groupingswere an indication of the historical compromise that was\n   being asked of allsides. The midnight deadline, of 9 April 1998, was\n   not achieved but parties andgovernments stayed at the Stormont castle\n   until an agreement was reached. Theimminent arrival of the Easter\n   weekend, and the prospect of a collapse of thetalks, gave the process\n   and participants a last push. The news of theAgreement was reported in\n   the late afternoon on Good Friday. Amazingly all theparties involved\n   in the talks attended the final session in which GeorgeMitchell\n   announced that an agreement had been reached and that the\n   multi-partytalks were at end. Those involved in the process were\n   careful not to claim itas a victory for any particular party, but\n   rather as the best agreement thatcould be achieved in the\n   circumstances.\n\n   Is this a complicated process? It most definitely is, but it is not\n   impossible.Some people feared that these events would derail the peace\n   process. Others weredetermined not to let that happen. After the 1998\n   Omagh bombing incident, aspokesman for British Prime Minister Tony\n   Blair said, What the last few daysactually have shown is that the\n   Agreement and the peace process have survivedand have emerged\n   strengthened from the process.\n\n   It is unclear yet whether this sentiment is true, or is merely wishful\n   thinking.In the past, there have been agreements reached that\n   subsequently fell apart.Will this one be different? Maintaining this\n   agreement will require tremendouswillpower on both sides. People who\n   have traditionally resolved disputes throughthe use of guns and bombs\n   will have to learn the art of compromise. On the daythe agreement was\n   reached, President Clinton said:\n\n   \"All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland know the task of making\n   the peaceendure will be difficult. The path of peace is never easy.\n   But the parties havemade brave decisions. They have chosen hope over\n   hate, the promise of the futureover the poison of the past. And in so\n   doing, already they have written a newchapter in the rich history of\n   their island -- a chapter of resolute couragethat inspires us all.\"\n\n   It seems clear that the majority of people are ready to undertake this\n   challengein return for a peaceful existence. Will their leaders be\n   able to follow theirwishes? Only time will tell.\n\n   Bibliography\n\n   Brewer, John D. and Gareth I. Higgins: Anti-Catholicism in\n   NorthernIreland, 1600-1998.

Europe and America should be jealous of me, because\n   I've been spending days on end at the beach browning up. I've had some\n   much needed time to finish of Splinter Cell, and get back into the\n   coding routine - especially now that I have my motherboard back after\n   five weeks of awol maintenance. At least it all works now.\n\n   Today my house was attacked by a kookaburra, and after trying to get\n   it out of the house i realised i'd never been so close one before. A\n   pair of the birds live in the gum tree out the back, and they come\n   back every year to have babies and get fed chicken by us. If you've\n   never seen one before, here's a photo I took of it trying to\n   understand how something could be so transparent but so solid.\n\n\n\n   In other news, in 6 days I'll be leaving for my next adventure, to the\n   wonders of Turkey, Egypt & Israel.

Its innards are all Intel, so everything works fine in\n   Linux. Its nice coming from the hassle and incomplete support of\n   ndiswrapper to the open source drivers that Intel apparently helps\n   support.\n\nKubuntu\n\n   My main desktop is Gentoo and has been for the past 4 years. I'm\n   rather happy with it: I know how it all works, its continuously\n   updated, has good support for commercial software. However this laptop\n   has only 512 of RAM (rather painful for compiling) and I had heard\n   that Kubuntu has good laptop support.\n   And indeed thats pretty much the case. All of my hardware was\n   recognized: the dual-core, the wireless, the Intel graphics chip and\n   power saving and status features are all working without any\n   configuration. It was the easiest install I've ever done. And I'm\n   happy with the result too, Kubuntu does a good job of putting\n   everything together. The complaints I'm about to go into don't take\n   away too much from this fact. :-)\n   The problem with Kubuntu and Ubuntu are their defaults for the repos.\n   I'm pretty sure the fact that the default repos get better support\n   then the 'universe' 'multiverse' etc. repos is something that is only\n   understood by only a few. And apparently thats the entire reason for\n   not having them on by default. So when I wanted to install kdevelop, I\n   was a little puzzled at first. Gentoo currently shines in this area,\n   I've only ever had to use an \"overlay\" if I wanted to install\n   unreleased software.\n   The other issue I've had is with wireless network configuration (at\n   least its not wireless driver configuration!) If there's a Kubuntu\n   equivalent to Gentoo's /etc/conf.d/wireless I haven't found it. Right\n   now wireless works if I run wlassistant (a GUI interface to configure\n   the wireless) try to connect, it fails, and then I restart\n   /etc/init.d/networking. That doesn't make too much sense, I know.\n   In general their startup scripts seem to be all pretty unorganized.\n   All written in plain /bin/sh and with no clear design (like instead of\n   a general dependency system, there are scripts that are run before and\n   after specifically network goes up and down). Gentoo's startup and\n   configuration system is hardly revolutionary which I suppose makes\n   Kubuntu's antiquated system that much more frustrating.\n\nx2x\n\n   x2x is a cool little utility. It lets you control two computers easily\n   with one mouse/keyboard. I made an icon in my quick launch to the\n   following:\n   ssh -X ian@`kdialog --inputbox 'Connect with what host?' some.host`\n   \"x2x -west -from :0.\"\n   And with that I can just set my laptop down and start using my\n   desktop's mouse and keyboard to control both.\n\nKirksville\n\n   I'm returning to Kirksville, Missouri tomorrow. Its felt like a long\n   time even though it was only a half week: it will be good to be back.\n   Posted by Ian Monroe in eean at 00:06 \n\nSunday, November 19. 2006\n\neean: dang it Jeff\n\n   --> jefferai has joined this channel\n   (n=jeff@amarok/developer/mitchell).\n   *** jefferai sets the channel topic to \"jefferai got his Wii -- see\n   all you suckaz l8tr :: We're pulling a Linus: 1.4 will be our 2.6.

        "articleBody": "AR-Views\n\n   \n\n                          AR-Views Crucial Points\n\n   This essay is designed to be a resource for people willing to\n   subscribeAR-Views, but who are not sure, if theyfit the list pattern\n   of an animal rights advocate.\n\n   For basic questions about Animal Rights see the AR-FAQ(Animal Rights\n   frequently asked questions)\n\n   (to be completed)\n\nthe incremental movement toward abolition\n\n   Here is some commentary on the question. It's an excerpt from 48\n   Rutgers LawReview 397, 448-468, ANIMAL RIGHTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE\n   Copyright 1995 byGary L. Francione. Portions of this article are taken\n   from the book RainWithout Thunder. Footnotes are omitted.\n\n   CRITERION #1: An Incremental Change Must Constitute a Prohibition\n\n   ...Thus the first criterion for any incremental change, beyond\n   theincremental education of the public about the need to\n   abolishinstitutionalized animal exploitation, is that it must prohibit\n   somereasonably identifiable behavior. This prohibition must also\n   correlate withthe ability of the animal to claim (through a\n   representative) the protectionof the right.\n\n   The requirement that there be a prohibition, and not merely a\n   regulationthat requires \"humane\" treatment, is sometimes phrased as\n   requiring the\"abolition\" of a particular practice. Although this is a\n   correct descriptionof the matter, it can cause confusion by equating\n   the abolition ofinstitutionalized animal exploitation with incremental\n   measures that, it ishoped, will lead to that abolition. On the first\n   level of moral theory,animal rights theory is clearly \"abolitionist\"\n   in that its long-term goal isthe complete eradication of\n   institutionalized animal exploitation. What weare examining now is\n   whether there are adequate criteria that can be used toidentify\n   incremental means to the long-term goal.\n\n   To say that the incremental means must themselves be \"abolitionist\"\n   iscorrect if the definition includes prohibitions against\n   reasonablyidentifiable conduct which, if engaged in, would constitute\n   a failure torespect a particular animal interest. But these\n   incremental means are bydefinition not \"abolitionist\" in the sense\n   that no one incrementalprohibition will effect the long-term goal of\n   ending animal slavery. Inorder to avoid confusion, it is better to\n   reserve the use of \"abolition\" forthe long-term goal of rights theory,\n   and \"prohibition\" as one criterion ofincremental measures that seek to\n   realize that long-term goal....\n\n   CRITERION #2: There Must Be a Prohibition of an Identifiable Activity\n   Thatis Constitutive of the Exploitative Institution\n\n   Consider the following proposals:\n\n   Proposal 1: Reduce the number of hens confined in a battery cage\n   (usuallyfloor space is a twelve inch square) from four hens to three\n   hens.\n\n   Proposal 2: Criminalize the use of animals in drug addiction\n   experiments.\n\n   These proposals cannot be distinguished using the first criterion\n   alone,because, for the reasons stated above, both of these can be\n   considered toinvolve prohibitions. Although Proposal 2 accords more\n   with the notion of aprohibition, Proposal 1 can be conceptualized as a\n   prohibition on keepingfour chickens in a cage.\n\n   This is not to say, however, that there are no distinctions between\n   Proposal1 and Proposal 2. With respect to the criminalization of the\n   use of animalsin a certain type of experiment, a particular activity\n   that is constitutiveof the general practice of vivisection has been\n   stopped.\n\n   ...[E]ven if the elimination of the battery cage and the substitution\n   of thesmall hen house constitute a prohibition of an activity (i.e.,\n   the use ofthe battery cage), that proposal implicates the problem that\n   the changenevertheless continues to sanction the exploitation of the\n   hens, albeit in adifferent form.\n\n   CRITERION #3: The Prohibition of a Constitutive Activity Must\n   Recognize andRespect a Non-Institutional Animal Interest\n\n   Although there is some controversy over whether animals can be said to\n   have\"interests,\" as has been discussed elsewhere, for good reasons,\n   most people,including those who exploit animals, regard nonhumans as\n   having a wide rangeof interests. The law supposedly protects animal\n   interests. The problem isthat for the most part, these interests are\n   those that facilitate theexploitation of animals for a particular\n   property use. For example, the lawprotects the interests of animals\n   used in experiments to the extentnecessary to ensure that the animal\n   produces data of the quality consideredacceptable by research\n   scientists. Indeed, those who support the use ofanimals in experiments\n   assure the public that \"only those animals that arecared for properly\n   will be good research subjects,\" and that the federalAnimal Welfare\n   Act and other sources of regulation provide for the requisitecare. In\n   this sense, each form of institutionalized exploitation will haverules\n   about the \"humane\" care of animals that are tailored to thatparticular\n   use of animal property and that reflect the particular concernsof that\n   exploitative activity.\n\n   To the extent that we seek the incremental eradication of the\n   propertystatus of animals, it is necessary that there is a\n   corresponding recognitionof the interests of animals in not being\n   regarded as property, or, as Reganwould say, in not being treated\n   exclusively as a means to human ends. ...Toeradicate the property\n   status of animals, there must be a recognition of aninterest that is\n   noninstitutional, or that is not simply an interest thatensures the\n   animal is used \"wisely\" in a context of exploitation. It is\n   onlythrough recognition of extra or noninstitutional interests that\n   incrementaleradication of property status can be achieved; recognition\n   of institutionalinterests, such as the interest of a turkey destined\n   for slaughter in beingfed, merely reinforces and supports the property\n   status of animals. ...\n\n   CRITERION #4: Animal Interests Cannot Be \"Tradable\"\n\n   ...If there is to be an incremental eradication of the property status\n   ofanimals, then there must be a recognition that animals have\n   interests thatgo beyond those interests that must be respected if we\n   are to exploitanimals efficiently. And, following the second salient\n   assumption of animalrights theory, these non-institutional interests\n   cannot be tradable justbecause the aggregation of consequences\n   indicates that the trade isjustified to secure the human \"benefit.\"\n   Indeed, animals are propertyprecisely because animals have no\n   interests (beyond those that must beobserved if the animals are to\n   serve their \"purpose\" as our property) thatare safe from being\n   balanced away as soon as some human \"benefit\" isidentified.\n\n   In one sense, this criterion seeks to ensure that the\n   incrementaleradication of property status is indeed an incremental\n   \"assembly\" ofpersonhood status for nonhumans through the recognition\n   of the inherentvalue of animals. At present, we do not recognize\n   animals as having anyvalue except for their value to us. For example,\n   philosopher Joseph Razclaims that although animals may have some value\n   apart from theirinstrumental use to people, animals cannot have\n   inherent value because anyvalue of the animal ultimately derives from\n   the animal's contribution to thehappiness and well-being of some human\n   or humans, who do have inherentvalue. Raz's views are representative\n   of many people's views. The fourthcriterion ensures that each\n   incremental move provides for and protects somenotion of the inherent\n   value of animals.\n\n   In one sense, this criterion could be said to address the\n   enforceability ofprotection for recognized interests. One could say\n   that under slavery aspracticed in the United States, there were some\n   laws that seemed torecognize that slaves had interests other than ones\n   directly related tokeeping a slave alive and fit for whatever purpose\n   the slave was intended.For the most part, however, these interests\n   were ignored whenever theyconflicted with the interests of the master\n   whose property rights were heldto outweigh the slave's interests. If\n   animal interests are to be takenseriously, then, to the extent that\n   the law regulates the use of animalproperty beyond what is necessary\n   to exploit the animal property, thatregulation must be held as\n   eliminating the property right to the extentnecessary to protect the\n   interest. Otherwise, the victory for animals willbe illusory; as soon\n   as the rights of human property owners are triggered,the animal\n   interest will be ignored.\n\n   Accordingly, the interest of the animal must be seen explicitly as\n   aninterest that is to be protected as would a true \"right\" within the\n   legalsystem. The interest would not be a \"right\" in the full sense in\n   that sinceanimals would not yet possess the basic right not to be\n   regarded as property(they would still be used for food and in\n   experiments), they would havenonbasic rights that could be said to be\n   building blocks of the basic rightnot to be property. These nonbasic\n   rights must, however, be treated asthough they were rights in the\n   sense that they will be regarded asprotecting interests that are not\n   subject to interest balancing.\n\n   To protect animal interests in this manner would require a very\n   deliberateand intentional recognition of a type of legal norm that our\n   legal systemdoes not yet recognize: a norm that functions like a true\n   right in that itrecognizes an interest that cannot be balanced away,\n   but that is held by abeing who has not yet achieved the status of\n   being a holder of the basicright not to be regarded exclusively as a\n   means to an end. Indeed, everytime we recognize such a right, we move\n   away from treating the beingexclusively as a means to human ends; the\n   problem is that the being's mostfundamental interests in not being\n   eaten or used in experiments or kept in azoo have not yet been\n   recognized. These incremental measures may be seen,however, as\n   recognizing pieces of the basic right not to be regarded asproperty.\n   So, although these interests represent nonbasic rights in onesense\n   (the animal does not yet by definition have the basic right of\n   notbeing property), the interests are more properly regarded as\n   \"parts\" of thebasic right of animals not to be treated exclusively as\n   means to human ends.\n\n   ..In order to recognize that animals have such interests, it is\n   necessarythat these interests be understood as trumping the interests\n   of propertyowners. And in order to be effective, it would be necessary\n   for the legalsystem to recognize that it is animals who hold this\n   interest, and not theirowners or government agencies, such as the\n   USDA, which protects onlythose animal interests that make animals\n   property in the first place. Itwould be necessary to recognize that\n   animals (or, more properlyspeaking, the guardians of animals) have\n   standing to articulate theseinterests against property owners, which\n   would functionally require thatsome sort of guardian be recognized.\n\n   Because animals are regarded as property, and property is, by\n   definition andseveral hundred years of accepted understanding, that\n   which cannot havelegal relations with persons or other property,\n   courts have developeddoctrines that preclude animals or their\n   surrogates from articulating theirinterests in courts of law and\n   before regulatory agencies. This exclusion isbased on the supposed\n   inability (in terms of the power of the court) toadjudicate claims\n   made by property or those who purport to represent thatproperty. So,\n   if the ... non-institutional interests of animals are to\n   benon-tradable, then those interests, which must be seen as\n   recognizing\"minitrumps\" of the property rights of animal owners, must\n   be protected bythe legal system. This will require that animal\n   interests have legalstanding and that some human actor (and this could\n   be the police) havestanding to articulate those claims before the\n   appropriate body. This is, ofcourse, not a new idea. In Should Trees\n   Have Standing? -- Toward LegalRights for Natural Objects, Christopher\n   Stone argued that the inherent valueof nonhumans could be recognized\n   and protected by guardians just as are therights (basic rights and\n   nonbasic rights) of children or the mentallydisabled.\n\n   CRITERION #5: The Prohibition Should Not Substitute an Alternative,\n   andSupposedly More \"Humane\" Form of Exploitation\n\n   This fifth criterion follows from both aspects of rights theory\n   identifiedat the outset of this section: that rights theory requires\n   eradication ofthe property status of animals and that the right of\n   animals not to beregarded as property cannot be compromised for\n   consequential reasons. Inmany respects, this fifth criterion is the\n   most significant of the groupbecause it often will be the most helpful\n   in determining whether a proposedincremental measure is consistent\n   with rights theory, although, like theother criteria, this one is not\n   exact and will not provide an easy answer inall cases. But then, the\n   idea is to try to make a morally informed decision,and not necessarily\n   one that is always right.\n\n   The fifth criterion holds that it is inconsistent with rights theory\n   totreat some animals exclusively as means to the ends of others, or\n   asproperty, in order to secure some benefit that it is hoped will\n   eventuallysecure a higher moral status for other animals. This is a\n   serious problemfor the new welfarist who purports to endorse the\n   long-term goal of animalrights by using short-term welfarist reforms\n   as a means to the end ofabolition of institutionalized exploitation.\n\n   The new welfarist disregards the inherent value of some animals in\n   order tosecure a benefit for other animals. For example, the federal\n   Animal WelfareAct provides that animals may be used in biomedical\n   experiments as long astheir use is \"humane\" and they are not forced to\n   suffer \"unnecessarily.\" Thenew welfarists, who supported the 1985\n   amendments to the Act, believe thatthe Act will itself reduce animal\n   suffering, but more importantly, that lawslike the Act are \"stepping\n   stones\" to the future recognition and respect ofanimals other than the\n   ones whose interests are now being ignored. ThisArticle argued earlier\n   that there is simply no way to determine whether lawslike the Act\n   actually reduce animal suffering, and that, given thestructural\n   defects of welfare theory generally, such laws will generally beheld\n   only to require that conduct that facilitates the use of the animal\n   asproperty. Apart from the rather puzzling logic of how we get to\n   anon-property status of animals by persistent reinforcement of the\n   propertyparadigm, there is something objectionable on a theoretical\n   level when arights advocate explicitly endorses the property status of\n   animals as a wayof eradicating that status on an incremental basis.\n\n   ...So, for example, a complete prohibition on the use of chimpanzees\n   incertain procedures can reasonably be said to constitute the\n   prohibition of aconstitutive activity, but to the extent that the\n   advocate urges or acceptsthat other animals, such as dogs, should be\n   used instead...such a rule wouldviolate the fundamental proscription\n   against speciesism.\n\n   In order to understand more fully the point of this fifth\n   criterion,consider the following example: animal advocates propose to\n   lobby for a lawthe preamble of which explicitly recognizes that\n   animals have moralinterests and the current configuration of battery\n   hens per cage disrespectsthose moral interests. The body of the law\n   provides that in recognition ofthe interests that hens have, no more\n   than two shall be placed in batterycages, and these cages shall be\n   enlarged to provide 196 inches of floorspacerather than 144 inches.\n   The egg industry objects to this arrangementvehemently as it is\n   \"unnecessary\" to maximize the value of animal propertyand will, in\n   fact, impose a very significant cost on the ownership of\n   animalproperty in this context. The law provides that this interest\n   must beprotected irrespective of the economic consequences and\n   contains penaltiesto ensure that the interests are not recognized\n   subject to completedefeasance through a claim of human \"benefit.\"\n\n   The traditional welfarist would undoubtedly support this measure\n   because itwill, in the welfarist's view, reduce animal suffering. The\n   new welfarist,who seeks as a long-term goal the abolition of animal\n   exploitation, willalso undoubtedly support this, not only because it\n   will supposedly reducesuffering, but because it is a \"stepping stone\"\n   or \"springboard\" intoabolition at some future time. The new welfarist\n   and the traditionalwelfarist have the same view -- that the measure\n   will reduce suffering --but the new welfarist, unlike the traditional\n   welfarist, believes thatbecause the measure will reduce suffering, it\n   will act as an incrementalmeasure on the road to the long-term goal.\n\n   The animal rights advocate first dismisses the view that avoiding pain\n   andsuffering are the only interests that animals (human or nonhuman)\n   have. Ifpain and suffering were the only relevant moral interests,\n   then what wouldprevent us from using small numbers of \"undesirable\"\n   humans to eradicatelarge amounts of human pain and suffering?\n   Obviously, although we all havestrong interests in avoiding pain and\n   suffering, we do limit the ways inwhich pain and suffering can be\n   alleviated so as to respect otherinterests -- such as the rights of\n   humans (and nonhumans) -- as well.Second, the rights advocate\n   dismisses the new welfarist view, alsoarticulated by Singer, that a\n   measure that reduces pain and suffering willlead to incremental\n   achievement of the long-term goal of equal considerationfor equal\n   interests (Singer) or the abolition of all\n   institutionalizedexploitation (Regan) simply because it supposedly\n   reduces pain andsuffering. The rights advocate knows that some\n   measures that supposedlyreduce pain and suffering will do nothing more\n   than assure that animalsreceive protection that is consistent with\n   their status as property, andthat facilitates their use as particular\n   types of property.\n\n   The rights advocate begins by asking whether the proposal contains\n   aprohibition or a regulation, and concludes that the proposal\n   prohibitskeeping more than two hens in the cage. She is unclear as to\n   whether, evenif the proposal is a prohibition, it constitutes a\n   prohibition of anactivity that is constitutive of the overall form of\n   exploitation. She errsin favor of regarding the measure as prohibiting\n   a constitutive activity.She is clear, however, that the proposal\n   provides for the recognition of aninterest that is extra-institutional\n   in that it provides for the recognitionof an interest that is not tied\n   to the property status of the hens. Theproposal recognizes that the\n   hens have inherent value beyond their status asproperty, which would\n   justify only that level of regulation that facilitatedanimal use.\n   Moreover, the proposal provides that these interests cannot betraded\n   away and constitute proto-rights.\n\n   The problem with the proposal is that it is, on its face, not\n   onlyconsistent with the status of animals as property that, as a\n   general matter,lacks inherent value, but does so in a way that\n   explicitly trades away thebasic right of the hens not to be property\n   in favor of a recognition ofmoral status that falls short of\n   recognition of the basic right, or thecomplete protection of some\n   interest that the animal has in, for example,bodily movement. By\n   agreeing to the two-hen arrangement, animal advocatesare trying to\n   achieve proto-rights while at the same time endorsing analternative\n   form of exploitation -- two hens in a cage -- that is supposedlymore\n   \"humane.\"\n\n   In the present case, it seems reasonable to say that the interest\n   involvedis the interest that the hens have -- all of them -- in not\n   being in thebattery cage in the first place and in having freedom of\n   movement that isappropriate to the species. To the extent that the\n   proposal recognizes andrespects that interest, then the prohibition\n   arguably does not substituteanother form of exploitation and is\n   acceptable. That is, assume that aprohibition abolishes the battery\n   cage entirely and replaces it with arearing system that accommodates\n   all of the hen's interests in freedom ofmovement and thereby fully\n   recognizes the interest of the hen's bodilyintegrity. Such a state of\n   affairs may be another way of saying that theprohibition ends a\n   particular form of exploitation that has violated aparticular\n   non-institutional, non-tradable interest that we have now decidedto\n   respect. But this sort of substitution differs considerably from\n   merelyremoving two of the hens from the cage in that although we have\n   not yetabolished the institutionalized exploitation, the substitution\n   eliminatesthe exploitation involved in the confinement system through\n   a fullrecognition of the interest of the hens in their freedom of\n   movement.\n\n   In any event, any substitution of exploitation raises serious\n   questions forthe rights advocate. If the incremental eradication of\n   the property statusof animals is going to be consistent with rights\n   theory, it is importantthat proposed measures not substitute one form\n   of exploitation for another,supposedly more \"humane\" form of\n   exploitation. Oftentimes, the alternativeform of exploitation will\n   provide in general terms for \"humane\" treatment,which then feeds the\n   whole matter right back through the mechanisms of legalwelfarism\n   which, as argued before, are structurally defective andsystematically\n   devalue animal interests. But even if the substitute form\n   ofexploitation is more definite (i.e., there shall be no more than two\n   birdsper cage), and even if the proposal recognizes that the animals\n   have someinherent value that justifies the recognition of a\n   non-institutional,non-tradable interest, that recognition comes at the\n   expense of endorsinganother form of exploitation that rests on the\n   legitimacy of the status ofanimals as property. This sacrifices the\n   moral right of the animal not to beproperty for a proto-right that is\n   designed to effect the incrementaleradication of property status. The\n   substitution of exploitation raisesissues of moral conflict with\n   rights theory, and incoherence in light of thefundamental assumptions\n   of that theory.\n\n   This discussion does serve, however, to demonstrate that as a\n   practicalmatter, certain campaigns will be difficult for animal rights\n   advocates topursue if they agree with this fifth criterion. It seems\n   that the rightsadvocate really has no choice but to condemn any form\n   of substituteexploitation, unless that alternative arrangement\n   completely eradicates anactivity constitutive of animal exploitation\n   through the full recognition ofrelevant animal interests. The animal\n   advocate must not herself suggest analternative, and must not agree to\n   any alternative offered by the exploiter.To do either would involve\n   the rights advocate sacrificing the basic rightof animals not to be\n   property in order to secure a less-than-basicproto-right that, while\n   it does recognize and respect that animals haveperson-like interests\n   that transcend their status as property, is achievedat the cost of\n   reinforcing the notion that a \"better\" system of animalslavery is\n   acceptable. These considerations would militate in favor ofconducting\n   the sort of campaign that may not succeed (at least initially),but\n   that will have a potentially powerful effect on educating members of\n   thepublic about animal exploitation. And in many respects, such\n   education,whether sought directly in the classroom or as part of a\n   militant campaignsuch as one that supports a law to demand the end of\n   the egg battery andthat urges no substitute form of exploitation\n   (rather than a reactionary andconservative welfarist campaign to make\n   the matters more \"humane\" for thehens) is probably the best thing that\n   the animal rights advocate can do atthis stage of history in any\n   event.\n   \n   ______________________________________________________________________"
