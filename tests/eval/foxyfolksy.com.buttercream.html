<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My best friend, Sharon, asked me to make a chocolate cake for her hubby, Ariel, for his birthday last week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The thing is I know a really good (probably the best) <a href="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/very-chocolate-cake-in-marshmallow-fondant-part-iii/">chocolate cake</a> recipe that I usually use to make my <a href="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/easy-chocolate-mousse-cake-recipe/">mousse cake</a>. But the usual mousse cake I make is probably not the best one in a hot weathered country like the Philippines. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Sure we have mousse cakes here but I am just worried about the handling from the time the cake will be picked-up up to the time that it will be served. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am not sure if this delicate cake can handle all that heat&#8230;literally! Frankly, I am really hesitant to make anything that involves whipped cream unless I know it can be served cold or directly from a fridge or chiller.</span></p>
<p><img class="border-gray aligncenter wp-image-10749 size-full" src="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ermine-frosting-1.jpg" alt="Try this Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So, the answer:  buttercream frosting!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I&#8217;ve made American buttercream and Swiss meringue buttercream before. They are both with advantages and disadvantages. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">American buttercream is the easiest to make but it can be too sweet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On the other hand, swiss meringue is less sweet but can be a little daunting to make. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I personally find American buttercream tooth-achingly sweet and I usually end up with a slightly gritty texture (from the powdered sugar) which is fine for other people, some actually like it. But for those people (like me) who are not a big fan of American buttercream, you should definitely try <strong>Ermine Icing</strong>. </span></p>
<p><img class="border-gray aligncenter wp-image-10750 size-full" src="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/chocolate-buttercream-frosting-1.jpg" alt="Try this Chocolate Buttercream Frosting.

It is easily the best buttercream frosting I've tried. | www.foxyfolksy.com" width="640" height="960" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It is also called <em>flour buttercream</em> or <em>cooked frosting.</em> It is light and fluffy and smoother than the classic American Buttercream Frosting. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Although it involves a bit more work but definitely easier than Swiss Meringue Frosting. It is simply making a milk pudding and combining it with softened butter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">But for my cake, I added cocoa powder to make chocolate frosting. I actually ended up with two variations. The first variation is with cocoa powder added at the end, while with the second, it was added in the beginning to make chocolate pudding. </span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first variation is great for frosting cakes as it is sturdier and the latter for cupcakes because of its lightness and fluffiness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To me, it is easily the best cupcake frosting. </span></p>
<p><img class="border-gray aligncenter wp-image-10754 size-full" src="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/creamed-butter.jpg" alt="How creamed butter looks like after 5 minutes of beating! | www.foxyfolksy.com" width="640" height="348" /></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Above is how your butter should look like after beating it for five minutes with electric mixer. Below is how it looks like after combining the pudding and butter together.</span></p>

<li>This chocolate buttercream frosting is best for cupcakes. It is very light and fluffy, with a mousse-like consistency.</li>
<li>If you prefer a bit sturdier version to use for cakes, add the cocoa powder in the end instead of adding it to the pudding. After you have added all the milk pudding to the creamed butter, sift the cocoa powder and beat the mixture for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
<li>This recipe is enough generously frost about 12 cupcakes or a two-layered 8-inch cake.</li>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Below is the cake I made using this Chocolate Buttercream Frosting recipe (Variation 1). It is a bit denser and darker than the (cupcake frosting) second variation. This is <em>not</em> the cake I made for Ariel, but since they were so happy with that cake, Sharon asked for a second one for her sister who also recently had her birthday and  I had the chance to make a similar one to test my new recipe</span>.<span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This is, by the way, my <a href="https://www.foxyfolksy.com/bare-chocolate-drip-cake/">Bare Chocolate Drip Cake</a>, which I will share on my next post!     </span></p>

					<p>Ermine icing normally can hold its shape in warmer climates than buttercream but I would still not put it in direct heat or where it is very warm. I would actually recommend piping the frosting in the cupcakes and refrigerate them. Just take them out before transporting them.</p>

					<p>Hi i made this recipe and it sure is better buttercream since its not too sweet&#8230; but may i ask if i can add cream cheese in it &#8230; lets say half butter half cream cheese&#8230; will it be sturdy to coat a two layer 8 inch cake&#8230; im worried that if i put cream cheese it will be runny already&#8230; hope to hear your expert advise&#8230; by the way thank you for this frosting recipe</p>

So helpful. I love baking. I too had a cake to decorate and in the crisis, could not get icing sugar or fudge frosting.  I was skeptical  about the flour, but this is a fantastic recipe, really delicious will definitely be one of my regular go to&#8217;s from now on. Thank you so much Bebs. x</p>

					<p>Hi Bebs,</p>
<p>I have made this frosting and it is in the fridge now. After taking out from the fridge, you mentioned to bring it to room temperature and mix it before piping. Do we mix it using spoon or mixer? Also, can I add some shortening? I find it&#8217;s very light and fluffy, not sure if it will hold its shape?</p>

					<p>Hi Bethany, you refrigerate it if you are not using it immediately. Beat it with an electric mixer so it can return to its original texture after refrigerating. It held well when I use to frost cakes and cupcakes. But since it has lots butter still, it can melt in warm temperatures.</p>

I made the frosting sans cocoa powder and it was great! Perfect smooth texture and it wasn&#8217;t too sweet which I love just the taste of buttercream. Now this I can understand craving a scoop full, haha!</p>

Thank you thank thank you for posting this recipe for a beautiful frosting! We too are housebound. We did a big grocery run but forgot powdered sugar, so my google search for chocolate frosting sans powdered sugar led me here. I though I was a traditional chocolate buttercream girl, but this recipe opened my tastebuds.  It&#8217;s definitely a favorite now. I&#8217;d leave a photo if it&#8217;s allowed &#8211; so delicious!</p>

Thank you for this recipe! Birthday cake Lockdown panic when I realised I had no icing sugar! This saved the day &#8211; everybody loved it! Will be my go to method from now on. Could it be adapted for different flavours do you think?</p>

After searching and searching for an icing that didn’t require powdered sugar I came across this one and tried it. Never will I ever use store bought icing again. My 12 year old daughter and I made this one evening. Super easy to make and tastes AMAZING. Thank you for sharing this recipe.</p>

I tried this recipe for your ermine icing and it is fabulous!  The Dutch chocolate has a really rich flavour. Thank you for posting it.</p>

As many people comment in here, this recipie is amazing. Quite easy to make and that taste! Not too sweet, just chocolaty enough, not too greasy like french and american buttercream can be. It&#8217;s really fluffy mike a chocolate mousse but richer. Thank you for this amazing recipie, really it&#8217;s amazing!!</p>

					<p>I tried this frosting and it failed! I got to the saucepan part and I followed the directions EXACTLY. It would NOT boil or anything even though I had it on the right temperature, nor would it thicken. Please let me know what I might have done wrong.

					<p>Hi Kati, it might take a while so you just have to wait and I am sure it will thicken because of the flour. You can try to increase the temperature a bit but watch that it does not get burn so stir it regularly.</p>

					<p>I am new to baking and I’ve made American buttercream but wanted to try Swiss meringue since I heard it’s silkier and not so sweet but it seemed daunting for a newbie baker. Yours was perfect. My kids LOVED it. I’m not allowed to use any other recipe for chocolate frosting now.</p>

First,  the taste??? Amazing! Just sweet enough,  silky smooth texture, almost pudding, not frosting! I think I could have lessened the amt of cream, because mine was a bit runny. However,  it was a hit.  I&#8217;ll be making again!</p>

					<p>Hi! First  of all, thanks for sharing this recipe! Seems great! I cant wait to try it out. I have a question though.. I have a cake recipe that yields 2, 8 inch cakes(about an inch or two in height each i guess)  that is stacked and filled together  to be one cake.<br />
Will this recipe suffice for an 8 inch cake as frosting and filling or frosting only?<br />
Thanks! Excited to try it out! </p>
<p>PS: I am a powdered sugar hater. Hahaha!</p>

I found myself in need of chocolate buttercream, and alas, I had no powdered sugar! I gave this recipe a shot, and while it is obviously more labor intensive than American buttercream (honestly, it would have been faster to just go to the closest store and buy some PS), it worked. </p>
<p>As stated, it&#8217;s not as sweet as the American version, but it is still sweet enough.</p>
